1004,July 13  2007 Senate Approves Clinton Measures to Help Wounded Servicemembers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  The Senate has approved the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  which contains a series of provisions offered by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  from her Heroes at Home Act of 2007  Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act and Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act  among others  to address problems facing our wounded servicemembers   The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act was approved as a first degree amendment to the Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization Act  which is currently being debated on the Senate floor         This represents another significant step forward in meeting our responsibility to our servicemembers to provide the healthcare and support they need   I am proud that the Senate has approved measures I put forward to improve screening for Traumatic Brain Injury  the signature wound of the war in Iraq  address problems servicemembers are facing as they transition between DoD and VA healthcare systems  and cut red tape preventing wounded servicemembers from receiving needed disability benefits   These are urgently needed steps for our servicemembers and their families  said Senator Clinton      The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act includes Senator Clintons provision mandating that the Department of Defense have a 180 day deadline for implementing a screening protocol for Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI    This builds on another measure that Senator Clinton secured in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  first introduced as part of her Heroes at Home Act of 2007  to improve detection of mild and moderate TBI by developing an objective assessment tool to measure cognitive functioning of solders both prior to and after deployment   The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act also includes elements of another Heroes at Home Act of 2007 proposal to provide needed advice and training for families struggling to take care of a loved one with brain injuries and psychological injuries      In addition  the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act includes Senator Clintons provision that would ensure that active duty and veterans healthcare services are available to all current and former members of the Armed Services who were injured after October 7  2001  not just those injured after implementation of the bill   Senator Clinton first called for providing a two year overlap of active duty and medically retired health care services and benefits for injured members and former members of the Armed Services as part of her Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act following reports that soldiers were experiencing problems receiving the healthcare they need as they transition from Department of Defense to VA care     The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act also contains a provision offered by Senator Clinton to make sure that efforts underway by the DoD and VA to create a joint electronic medical record result in a DoD VA medical record that is compatible and synchronized with the national efforts to develop a nationwide coordinated health IT infrastructure  an issue on which Senator Clinton has been a leader   This measure builds on provisions  which would provide oversight and leadership for a joint DoD VA interagency office  that Senator Clinton secured in the bill from her Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act   The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act also includes a measure from Senator Clintons Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act that would reform the current flawed disability rating system for wounded servicemembers by ending the flawed DoD rating system and having military departments adopt the VA disability rating system        The measure approved by the Senate also contains Senator Clintons provision to ensure needed oversight of the disability rating system for wounded servicemembers by continuing Government Accountability Office  GAO  reviews of treatment of wounded servicemembers   This measure also will ensure that disability benefit determination cases under review are prohibited from being reduced by a new determination   Senator Clinton proposed similar measures as part of her Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act   The Wounded Warrior bill approved by the Senate also includes two other measures from Senator Clintons Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act  a measure to help make sure servicemembers receive disability benefits they need and deserve by requiring an independent review of disability benefit ratings below 20 percent and increasing disability benefits as warranted and a provision to require that the shortage of Physical Evaluation Board liaison officers and attorneys be addressed by the DoD and VA    Finally  Senate approval of the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act included a measure offered by Senators Clinton and Collins  co chairs of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimers Disease  to require that any longitudinal studies on members of the Armed Forces with TBI also identify early signs of Alzheimers disease  Parkinsons disease and other neurodegeneration   Head injuries  after age and family history  are one of the leading risk factors for an individual developing Alzheimers disease   This amendment builds on a provision for a 15 year longitudinal study on long term health and mental health consequences of TBI that Senator Clinton proposed and was included in the FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act     The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act also includes a proposal from the TBI Access to Options Act  introduced by Senator Clinton along with Senator Evan Bayh  D IN  to provide medical advocates for traumatic brain injured servicemembers in the transition from DOD to VA medical treatment  preventing them from getting caught in bureaucracy and red tape       As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need  She has introduced legislation to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families  Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits  She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform  She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing and was recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need  She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families         ,0

203,   Obama Statement on Senate Debate Over Redeploying U S  Troops from Iraq   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Senate Debate Over Redeploying U S  Troops from Iraq Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt       WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the all night Senate debate over redeploying U S  troops from Iraq   Obama is a co sponsor of the Levin Reed amendment and the sponsor of the Iraq De Escalation Act   The text is below     We have heard from the Administration and from many of our colleagues in this chamber that we need to give the President s surge more time  that we need to wait to hear the report in September before we make a binding decision to redeploy our troops   Yet  we learned just last week that the Iraqi political leaders have not met a single benchmark that they had agreed to in January   Not one                          We do not need to wait for another report  We have seen the results of a failed policy in the form of multiple deployments  more sacrifice from our military families  and a deepening civil war in Iraq that has caught our troops in the middle             It is long past time to turn the page in Iraq  where each day we see the consequences of fighting a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged   The single most important decision a President or Member of Congress can make is the decision to send our troops into harm s way              It is that decision that determines the fate of our men and women in uniform  the course of nations  and the security of the American people   It is that decision that sets in motion consequences that cannot be undone             Since this war began  3 618 Americans have been killed     532 since the President ignored the will of the American people and launched his surge   Tens of thousands more have been wounded  suffering terrible injuries seen and unseen                         Here is what else we know   We know that the surge is not working  that our mission in Iraq must be changed  and that this war must be brought to a responsible conclusion             We know Iraq s leaders are not resolving their grievances   They are not stepping up to their security responsibilities   They are not improving the daily lives of Iraqis             We know that the war in Iraq costs us  370 million dollars a day and  10 billion each month   These are resources that could be spent to secure our ports and our borders  and to focus on a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan and the wider war on terrorism that is yet to be won             We know that because of the war in Iraq  America is no safer than it was on 9 11   Al Qaeda has gained the best recruiting tool it could ask for   Tens of thousands of terrorists have been trained and radicalized in Iraq   And terrorism is up worldwide          If America is attacked again  it will be in no small measure a consequence of our failure to destroy al Qaeda at its roots in Afghanistan and our failure to adequately secure the homeland   The decision to authorize and fight a misguided war in Iraq has created a new cadre of experienced terrorists bent on the destruction of the United States and our allies          If there   s still any question about whether Iraq has been a distraction from this critical war in Afghanistan and Pakistan  that should have been resolved yesterday with the release of the most recent National Intelligence Estimate    That report said that al Qaeda    has protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability  including  a safe haven in the Pakistan Federally Administered Tribal Areas  operational lieutenants  and its top leadership          And last week  a new threat assessment concluded that al Qaeda is as strong today as it was before 9 11          Seeing yet another report like this  I can only repeat what I said nearly five years ago  during the run up to this war   We are fighting on the wrong battlefield   The terrorists who attacked us and who continue to plot against us are resurgent in the hills between Afghanistan and Pakistan   They should have been our focus then   They must be our focus now          I opposed this war from the beginning  before the Congress voted to authorize the war in 2002   I said then that I could not support a war based not on reason but on passion  not on principle but on politics   I worried that it would lead to a US occupation of undetermined length  at undetermined cost  with undetermined consequences          I believed then     and I still believe now     that being a leader means that you d better do what s right and leave the politics aside   Because there are no do overs on an issue as important as war   You cannot undo the consequences of that decision         In January  I introduced a plan that would have already started bringing our troops home and ending this war  with a goal of removing all combat brigades by March 31  2008  Seventy eight days ago  President Bush vetoed a bipartisan plan that passed both houses of Congress that shared my goal of changing course and ending this war          During those 78 days  266 Americans have died  and the situation in Iraq has continued to deteriorate         It   s time to set a hard date to signal a new mission in Iraq and to begin to bring our troops home   It   s time to ensure that we complete the change in mission and the drawdown of our forces  by the end of April 2008     a date that is consistent with the date in my plan back in January          As we redeploy from Iraq     as I believe we must do     we have to redouble our efforts on all fronts in Afghanistan to ensure we do not lose ground there          Certainly  we   ve had some success there over the last five and half years  whether it   s the five fold increase in the number of Afghan boys and girls now attending schools or the free elections of a president and parliament          Yet the remaining challenges in Afghanistan are enormous   Opium production is expected to reach a record high this year  with revenues helping to fuel the Taliban and al Qaeda   The Taliban has increased its campaign of suicide attacks and roadside bombings in recent months   Most troubling  Mr  President  is this simple fact   The leaders of Al Qaeda     Osama bin Laden and his lieutenant Ayman Al Zawahiri     and the leader of the Taliban  Mullah Omar  remain at large   They are now free to operate in a safe haven in northwest Pakistan   That has to change          First  the United States must increase reconstruction efforts  on both the civilian and military side   If we are serious about winning the war on terror  we must shift to greater investments in winning the hearts and minds of Afghans   The U S  should allocate money in a way that allows more flexibility in our spending  permitting funding of local projects that benefit communities and promising local governments          Second  the U S  and NATO must turn around the security situation so that average Afghans regain their faith in the ability of their government and the international forces to ensure their security   Despite more than five years of an international military presence in their country  the sad reality is that most Afghans do not believe their government can guarantee their safety

1851,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF THE UNION
  Sen. Bernie Sanders said, ""Tonight we heard further evidence that this President is out of touch with the reality and needs of the American people. At a time when our citizens want to wind-down the war in Iraq and bring our troops home as soon as possible, the President has proposed escalating it. Instead of leading us towards universal health care, he wants to tax workers' health care benefits and cut funding for hospitals serving the lowest-income Americans. Instead of offering the meaningful policies needed to combat global warming and position our nation as a leader in clean energy he continues to offer only empty rhetoric. The American people cannot afford these backwards policies. It's time for bold action that will end the quagmire in Iraq, ensure that every Americans receives health care as a right of citizenship, and protect our environment for future generations.""

1193,June 15  2007 Clinton Announces Witness List for Senate Hearing into Federal Government Failures on Environmental Impact of 9 11 World Trade Center Attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senate Hearing to Examine the Federal Response to 9 11  Including U S  Environmental Protection Agency Programs to Test and Clean Indoor Spaces in Lower Manhattan  Lessons Learned from 9 11 and Federal Readiness to Respond to Releases of Hazardous Substances in Future Emergencies   Committee to hear testimony from President s Council on Environmental Quality  Environmental Protection Agency  the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Government Accountability Office among others  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced the witness list for the hearing of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health into the EPA s response to 9 11 and lessons learned for future emergency preparedness   The June 20  2007 hearing  to be held in Washington  DC  will include testimony from U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  official Susan Bodine  who oversees the EPA s emergency response office  The EPA will testify about their post 9 11 activities  including their two programs to test and clean indoor spaces  The hearing will also include testimony from James L  Connaughton  Chairman of the Presidents Council on Environmental Quality  CEQ   After the release of the EPA Inspector Generals  IG  report about EPA s 9 11 response in August of 2003  Mr  Connaughton committed the Administration to establish the EPA World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel  That panel examined a range of issues relating to contamination of indoor spaces that were raised by the 2003 IGs report   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  will also testify about investigatory work they have done at the request of Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler to evaluate the EPA s efforts to test and clean indoor spaces in New York City  Read More    The Senate Sub Committee will also hear from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry  the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health and a local resident  to examine the federal response to 9 11  including risk communication and EPA programs to test and clean indoor spaces in lower Manhattan  The hearing will also examine lessons learned from 9 11 and federal readiness to respond to releases of hazardous substances in future emergencies  We need to examine what went wrong and assess whether the federal government is better prepared to respond to environmental hazards in future disasters  said Senator Clinton  I also remain concerned about potential indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center and want to take a close look at the EPA s inadequate program to test and clean residential areas in Manhattan  For over five years  Clinton and Nadler have staunchly criticized the Administration s misleading public statements about post 9 11 air quality  as well as its continued failure to provide a proper testing and cleaning of indoor spaces contaminated by WTC toxins and its lack of provision of health care for the thousands of people who are ill as a result of exposure to the pollutants   New Yorkers were depending on the federal government to provide them with accurate information about the air they were breathing  And they are still depending on the federal government to assess the level of ongoing risk  Senator Clinton said  I hope this hearing will get to the bottom of what went wrong with the EPAs testing and clean up plan in response to the post 9 11 environmental disaster  what lessons were learned  and what the EPA intends to do to protect New Yorkers going forward  Senator Clintons hearing  along with the companion House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties hearing to be chaired on June 25  2007 by Congressman Jerrold Nadler  NY 08   represent the first comprehensive Congressional oversight investigations into these environmental matters since the immediate aftermath of the attacks  The two hearings together will take a comprehensive look at the failures of the Federal government in responding to the environmental crisis that resulted from the September 11  2001 World Trade Center attacks  While in the Majority  Republican House leadership steadfastly refused to hold a single hearing on this matter  More than five years after the attacks of September 11  2001  the EPA s work to address the environmental health consequences of those attacks remains unfinished  Starting from the EPAs assurances immediately following the attacks  and continuing throughout the past five years  the EPA s response to September 11th has not adequately protected public health and the environment  Senator Clinton said  There has also been a familiar pattern in which the Agency has sought to downplay the potential risks and convey false assurances regarding World Trade Center contamination  rather than developing a scientifically sound approach to assessing and reducing these risks   The full panel list is below      Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health Hearing EPA s Response to 9 11 and Lessons Learned for Future Emergency Preparedness 10 00 AM

446,   Durbin  Obama Urge France to Reconsider Decision to Deny U S  Request for Extradition of Confessed Chicago Murderer   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Durbin  Obama Urge France to Reconsider Decision to Deny U S  Request for Extradition of Confessed Chicago Murderer Monday  August 27  2007  For Immediate Release   Contact  Sandra Abrevaya  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner urging France to reconsider its decision not to extradite Hans Peterson  an American citizen who reportedly confessed to the 2006 murder of Dr  David Cornbleet in Chicago  Earlier this month  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities and confessed to the brutal murder of Dr  Cornbleet  a Chicago dermatologist   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   According to reports  Peterson  whose mother is French  fled to French territory after allegedly committing the murder in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   The U S  Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for Peterson s extradition   On August 23  France announced their decision not to extradite Peterson  Last week  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Charg   d Affaires Fran  ois Rivasseau at the French Embassy in Washington  DC  urging the Government of France to agree to the United States  request for Peterson   s extradition to face criminal prosecution Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   The Illinois Senators also sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  requesting that she immediately urge her French counterparts to examine the extradition request and to advise the U S  Embassy in Paris of the importance of this case  August 24  2007  The Honorable M  Bernard Kouchner   Foreign Minister  Ministry of Foreign Affairs   37  Quai d Orsay   F   75351 PARIS  Dear Mr  Minister   Congratulations on your appointment as Foreign Minister   You have had an impressive career pre dating this assignment  and your strong efforts have continued in your first months in this new position   We are writing in relation to an issue of great importance to Americans in my state of Illinois and of intense personal interest to us  the criminal investigation into the murder of Dr  David Cornbleet   Dr  Cornbleet  an American citizen in Chicago  Illinois  was brutally stabbed to death on October 24  2006   It is our understanding that Mr  Hans Peterson  also an American citizen  has confessed to the murder of Dr  Cornbleet  and is currently in the custody of French authorities in Guadeloupe   The United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for the extradition of Hans Peterson to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet s murder   We wrote earlier this week to the French Charg   d   Affaires in Washington  Fran  ois Rivasseau  underscoring our strong support for this extradition request   However  we learned from a letter from the Ministry of Justice to the U S  Department of Justice on August 22  as well as from a response to our letter that we received today from Charg   d   Affaires Rivasseau  that the Ministry of Justice considers the American born  U S  citizen Peterson to also be a French national and that the extradition request has been denied   These communications    which cite Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France as the primary basis for the decision not to extradite   are a blow to the Cornbleet family and to all Illinoisans    Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in pertinent part that    There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State      While this Article does not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state  it also does not appear to preclude extradition   To the extent there is discretion available in such extradition decisions  we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in favor of extradition   We believe the specific facts of this case justify Mr  Peterson   s extradition   As you may know  after Dr  Cornbleet s death  Mr  Peterson traveled to St  Martin in the French West Indies   In May 2007  Mr  Peterson sought and obtained a French passport after Mr  Peterson s American former roommates contacted the Chicago Police Department to report their suspicions that Peterson was involved in Dr  Cornbleet s murder   In June 2007  the State s Attorney s Office in Cook County  Illinois  confirmed that Mr  Peterson   s DNA was found at the crime scene and issued a warrant for Mr  Peterson s arrest   In August 2007  Mr  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities in St  Martin and allegedly confessed to murdering Dr  Cornbleet      After apparently living his entire life in the United States and under the protection of U S  laws  it appears that Mr  Peterson committed a heinous crime  fled the United States for French territory  and then asserted a claim to French citizenship in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   Dr  Cornbleet s family  the people of Illinois  and the United States criminal justice system have a strong and compelling interest in seeing Mr  Peterson face trial in the United States   We strongly urge the Government of France to reconsider its decision to deny the extradition request for Mr  Peterson and to allow him to face charges in the nation where the crime he confessed to was committed    We ask you for the favor of a swift response    Sincerely     Barack Obama    U S  Senator   Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator

develop local markets  but we need to do more at the federal level to support these programs   Schools  retailers  restaurants and food service providers across the state have already shown their enthusiasm for locally grown New York agricultural products and the growing interest that many have in developing a healthy  sustainable food culture also provides a great way for us to promote New

369,   Obama Joins Kerry to Push for Senate Investigation of Tax Shelter Abuses   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Obama Joins Kerry to Push for Senate Investigation of Tax Shelter Abuses Thursday  April 24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  April 24  2008  CONTACT  Liz Richardson  Kerry  or Michael Ortiz  Obama     WASHINGTON  DC   Senators John Kerry and Barack Obama sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  Sen  Carl Levin and Norm Coleman respectively  Kerry and Obama asked that their colleagues consider investigating government contractors that circumvent paying payroll taxes by hiring employees through offshore shell companies  Last month  Kerry and Obama introduced the Fair Share Act of 2008 to close this tax loophole and save the American taxpayer an estimated  846 million over ten years  In the House  the bill is being sponsored by Reps  Brad Ellsworth and Rahm Emanuel  and was recently included in the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008      Abusing offshore tax loopholes is wrong and at least one greedy company has fleeced the American taxpayer to the tune of hundreds of millions since the Iraq war began   said Senator Kerry   The American people who play by the rules and foot the bill for this war in Iraq deserve to know just how many companies are avoiding paying their fair share of taxes and how much it s costing our economy  The Senate has a responsibility to shed some sunlight on the tax practices of these government contractors  and we will not be satisfied until these kinds of loopholes are eliminated once and for all      It s the responsibility of American companies to pay their taxes and ensure that their employees  work is counted for future Social Security and Medicare benefits   said Senator Obama   It s unacceptable for contractors to use foreign shell companies to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes  and that s why Senator Kerry and I introduced legislation to close this loophole and hold these contractors accountable   I look forward to moving this legislation forward and working to crack down on tax havens and abusive tax shelters     Please find the text of Senator Kerry and Obama s letter below  April 23  2008 The Honorable Carl Levin    Chairman   Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations   Committee on Homeland Security   Governmental Affairs    199 Russell Senate Office Building      The Honorable Norm Coleman  Ranking Member  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  Committee on Homeland Security   Governmental Affairs    199 Russell Senate Office Building      Dear Senators Levin and Coleman  Recently  we introduced S  2775  the Fair Share Act of 2008  which ends the practice of U S  government contractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   Representatives Ellsworth and Emanuel also introduced companion legislation  This legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U S  companies performing services under contract with the United States government as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes  The legislation was introduced in response to a Boston Globe article in which Farah Stockman reported that Kellogg Brown   Root  KBR  has avoided payroll taxes by hiring workers through shell companies in the Cayman Islands   American companies who are benefiting from U S  government contracts are able to set up foreign subsidiaries in tax havens and treat American workers employed in connection with the contract as employees of the subsidiary   As a result  those employers can avoid Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes and their employees are denied the contributions for Federal benefits purposes  We bring this issue to your attention because we think it is another example of the abuse of offshore tax havens used in order to avoid the payment of U S  taxes   We believe closing this glaring loophole is consistent with your efforts to address tax shelters and tax havens   It is unclear how pervasive the practice used by KBR is  but there are numerous federal contractors that have subsidiaries located in tax havens and  as your investigations have uncovered  an abundance of tax professionals willing to help companies shirk their tax responsibilities whenever a loophole can be found      We are working with the Finance Committee to close this tax loophole  and the House recently included this legislation as part of the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that closing this loophole raises  846 million over ten years    We request that the Permanent Subcommittees on Investigations investigate this and similar abuses by federal contractors to avoid payroll taxes  and we look forward to continuing to work with you on measures to ensure fairness for American taxpayers    Sincerely   JOHN F  KERRY                                                         US Senator   BARACK OBAMA  US Senator

1656,February 1  2007 Clinton Announces Inclusion of Transit Financing Plan in FY 2008 White House Budget that Will Help Ensure Economic Recovery in Lower Manhattan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Proposal Would Provide New York City and State  2 Billion to Help Construct a Rail Link from Lower Manhattan to the JFK Airport Offering a   One Seat Ride    for Commuters and Business Travelers                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced the inclusion of a plan in the President  s FY 2008 Budget that will enable  2 billion in tax credits for the City and State of the New York to go towards the construction of the Lower Manhattan Rail Link to JFK Airport   Senator Clinton has been working with her colleagues in both the Senate and the House to pass this long sought after plan and today  s announcement is welcome news to those efforts             The inclusion of this provision in the budget is a tremendous victory for New York City and Lower Manhattan as we still work to regain our footing after the devastation of September 11th   The direct rail link to the JFK airport will help sustain the ongoing revitalization we have seen thus far  create jobs and new investment and will benefit all of the businesses and residents of Lower Manhattan   Nevertheless we need to ensure that we continue to have the White House  s support for this project as we move forward through the legislative process             Originally included in the  20 billion post 9 11 recovery package for New York City that was fought for and won by Senator Clinton  the tax incentives designed to encourage investment in the areas affected by the attacks were being underutilized due to the slow economic recovery in the area   Working with the City and a coalition of concerned New York businessmen and women  the City  State and New York delegation  Senator Clinton helped to modify the unused tax incentives and convert them into tax credits for the City and State that can be used against federal tax payments   Because the value of the tax credits can be fully utilized  the proposal ensures that the City and State will stand to directly benefit from  2 billion of tax credits             After the September 11th attacks 60 000 jobs in Lower Manhattan were lost   Despite significant recovery in the residential sector  the pace of employment recovery has been slow  The two main obstacles to Lower Manhattan  s continued growth  its relatively poor interconnection to workers in the suburbs and its relative inaccessibility to the national and international business community  would be directly addressed by the construction of this rail link   Senator Clinton said    I want to maintain Lower Manhattan  s role as a dynamic economic hub for the entire nation and the world  and addressing these critical transportation needs for our downtown businesses is one of the best ways to ensure that role for the future             It is estimated that the new rail link will help to create as many as 68 000 permanent new jobs in Lower Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn with more than  10 4 billion worth of economic output generated by the rail link annually          ,0
1235,September 15  2005 Senator Clinton Joins Democrats Urging DHS To Issue A Formal Statement Reassuring Immigrants To Seek Help Without Fear                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined with Senate Democrats  urging the Department of Homeland Security to issue a formal statement reassuring immigrant victims of Hurricane Katrina that they can seek help from relief agencies without fear of deportation or being turned over to immigration authorities  In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  the Senators asked that in light of the magnitude of the tragedy caused by Hurricane Katrina  the ongoing need for relief  and the continuous risk to public health and safety involved  such an assurance be issued to the hurricane  s immigrant victims as soon as possible        A copy of the Senators   letter is below        September 14  2005   The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528        Dear Secretary Chertoff         We write to strongly urge that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  issue a formal statement reassuring immigrants victimized by Hurricane Katrina that they may seek help from relief agencies without fear that they will be turned over to immigration authorities or that the federal government will seek to deport them  As you know  after the September 11 attacks  then INS Commissioner James Ziglar issued a statement encouraging undocumented immigrants to contact local authorities for help  and stated they could do so without fear that the agency would use their information for immigration purposes  In light of the magnitude of the tragedy caused by Hurricane Katrina  the ongoing need for relief  and the continuous risk to public health and safety involved  we urge you to issue such an assurance to the hurricane  s immigrant victims as soon as possible         Tens of thousands of immigrants  including large populations of Mexicans  Hondurans  and Vietnamese  live in the areas hit hardest along the Gulf Coast  Officials in Mexico estimate that 145 000 Mexicans alone may have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina  Many of these immigrants are undocumented  and few have sought help from relief agencies or gone to shelters for fear that they will be turned over to federal authorities for deportation  We understand that some legal immigrants who lost all of their documents in the hurricane are also afraid to seek help         DHS officials have publicly stated that rescuers have not been asking about immigration status  and President Vicente Fox of Mexico has said the United States agreed with his request not to prosecute undocumented Mexican migrants affected by Katrina who turn to U S  officials for help  However  we believe a clear statement by DHS confirming that information on undocumented immigrants will not be shared with immigration authorities is necessary in order to ensure the public health and safety  Thank you for your attention to this matter  We look forward to your response         Sincerely    Harry M  Reid   Democratic Leader  Richard Durbin   Assistant Democratic Leader  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Maria Cantwell  Barack Obama  Russ Feingold  Daniel Akaka  Frank R  Lautenberg  Joseph Lieberman  Carl Levin  John F  Kerry  Christopher J  Dodd  Patrick J  Leahy  Jon S  Corzine               ,0

847,April 12  2007 Clinton Continues to Fight for Our Troops   Veterans    Questions Pentagon and Veterans Affairs Officials About Treatment of Servicemembers and Veterans at Joint Armed Services Veteran Affairs Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                       Clinton Also Presses Deputy Defense Secretary About Pentagon Decision to Extend Deployments and Its Impact on Our Troops       Washington  DC   At a joint Senate Armed Services Committee and Veterans Affairs Committee hearing today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed the treatment of servicemembers and veterans following her trip to Upstate New York VA and military installations earlier this week             Senator Clinton also highlighted legislation she has introduced to address the challenges facing our servicemembers and to help them get the care they need             At the same hearing  Senator Clinton questioned Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England about the recent announcement by the Department of Defense to extend deployments for active duty personnel  Senator Clinton voiced concern over extending military deployments and the drastic effects it may have on an already overstretched military             The announcement yesterday by Secretary Gates that deployments for active duty will be extended raises serious questions both about the over stretched nature of the Army  which I think is getting to a crisis point  but also how we re going to continue to take care of those people as we put them in harms way for longer and longer periods of time   Our system  despite the best efforts of a lot of well meaning people  is not working commensurate with what we owe those who have served   And I think that looking at these problems that we are addressing today  in the context of this longer deployment  just makes the urgency even greater   said Senator Clinton            A transcript of Senator Clinton s statement at today s hearing follows              Thank you very much Mr  Chairman and thank you gentleman  Before I address the issues that brought us here today  I want to associate myself with the comments of both of the senators from Virginia  Senator Warner and Senator Webb speak from a great deal of experience  And Secretary England  the announcement yesterday by Secretary Gates that deployments for active duty will be extended raises serious questions both about the over stretched nature of the Army  which I think is getting to a crisis point  but also how we re going to continue to take care of those people as we put them in harms way for longer and longer periods of time   Our system  despite the best efforts of a lot of well meaning people  is not working commensurate with what we owe those who have served   And I think that looking at these problems that we are addressing today  in the context of this longer deployment  just makes the urgency even greater   And I hope that the suggestions that have been talked about today from General Scott s commission and others will be put on the fastest of tracks and work with the Congress to please get some answers to these problems         I spent Tuesday at the VA in Syracuse  New York and also up at Fort Drum where I met with more than 40 returning active duty soldiers   They ve been wounded and injured in both Iraq and Afghanistan   And I had a very frank discussion with them and I asked them what their situation was and here s what I heard  loss of their medical records was a constant refrain  something that I ve heard continually   One young soldier  who was wounded by an IED in Bagdad  said that as he was being rolled out on his gurney to get on the plane to go back to Landstuhl and a nurse put a packet on his chest and said   These are your medical records  don t lose them             He said   You know Ma am  I didn t get to Landstuhl with my medical records    I hear that over and over again            Physical Evaluation Board liaison officers who lack training or are just too busy  or no caseworker at all  lack of legal assistance for the appeals process  unfair determinations  at least in the minds of many of the soldiers certainly on a basis of comparability due to the administrative and bureaucratic burdens placed on soldiers   We ve talked a lot today about the disability system  but I don t think it accurately reflects TBI or PTSD  amputations  hearing loss and diseases that  since the first Gulf War  we have seen in some increase in numbers as military members have returned             And then one issue  which has not been mentioned and I want to put on the table  is that Traumatic Servicemembers Group Life insurance  which has been the subject of just anguished reports to me   As you know  this is an insurance policy that many of our soldiers sign up for and as of August 2006  over 41 percent of the claims have been denied   And what I heard at Fort Drum was that it s almost a joke   They call numbers  nobody answers   They get hung up on   They re basically told  here s the way it works  we turn you down and if you have the energy come back  maybe we ll do something for you  This is a disgrace and it s something that one Sergeant told me just made him laugh instead of cry   His convoy had been hit by an IED   He had severe injuries and the life insurance representatives told him that he d have to prove that he had been injured when he had his commanders  his doctors and everybody else already having made that case   I think this needs to be looked at seriously and I hope Mr  Chairman  we take a look at it as well  because from what I m hearing it is not performing the way it should            I also heard there is not a single neurosurgeon deployed to Afghanistan   And one of the problems we re having with head injuries is that people are sent directly from Afghanistan to Landstuhl   That s a long trip under often stressful circumstances   At the very least I hope  Secretary England  we can get a neurosurgical team to Bagram so that we have the facilities and the personnel there ready to take care of our young men and women            I also was distressed to learn that Fort Drum does not have a caseworker assigned to assist wounded soldiers navigating to the disability process   A few months ago  the only caseworker assigned to the post was reassigned to an administrative position   Then I heard from soldier after soldier that had it not been for this particular caseworker  they would ve been really lost   When I asked the commanders  they told me they are not authorized to spend budget dollars from operating and maintenance accounts to hire caseworkers because they are paid from a separate medical personnel fund  which is not under the control of the base commanders   Again  I think we need to look at that  One thing that these soldiers need is somebody to help them navigate through this process and for them to feel like they have someone on their side   To follow up on Senator Webb s question  perhaps we could consider asking retired personnel to volunteer to assist us in reducing this backlog   I think we need to put as much energy and urgency into this as possible          And finally  with respect to the electronic medical records  the VA system gets very high marks  not just within the VA system itself  but by external independent assessments   And yet  I hear the DoD electronic medical records system is plagued by failure to comply problems   People just don t want to do it and apparently they re not ordered to do it   Lots of slips with the information getting from the battle field into the system   And I just think it would be a smart  efficient approach to look at taking the VistA System in VA  which is an already functioning  effective system that has a proven track record  and extending it to DoD   Instead of trying to figure out how to merge and create a new system  let s go with what works  because I think there are too many records that are being lost and people are literally falling through the cracks   Mr  Chairman  I have a series of questions related to TBI and the legislation that I and Senator Collins  and I and Senator Bayh have introduced and I d like to submit those for the record               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning veterans          ,0
1910,"SEN. SANDERS: STAMP OUT POSTAL RATE HIKES
  Sen. Bernie Sanders said today that he was deeply concerned about new mailing rates which will raise mailing costs significantly for small to medium-size publications.  
   Sanders expressed concern that, at a time when fewer and fewer large media conglomerates control the flow of information in our country, these rate increases for small publications will make it harder for them to stay in business and may lead to even more media concentration of ownership. Sanders is working on a legislative strategy to counteract the Postal Service action. 
   ""This rate increase is tantamount to a tax on free speech,"" Sanders said. 
   ""The Postal Regulatory Commission has turned its back on American history and on the founders' faith in the importance of protecting the free flow of ideas,"" Sanders added. 
   Altogether, about 5,700 small-circulation publications could incur rate increases from 20 percent to more than 30 percent if the new rates take affect as scheduled on July 15, according to a study by the publisher McGraw Hill. 
   Diverse periodicals from the political left, right and center - such as The Nation, Mother Jones, The New Republic, The Weekly Standard, and the American Spectator - would bear the brunt of new postage charges on magazines under a rate system adopted at the urging of media giant Time-Warner. 
   The publisher of more than 100 magazines including People and Fortune, Time-Warner would have fared worse under an earlier Postal Service proposal. At the media giant's urging, the original plan was rejected by the Postal Regulatory Commission and the Postal Service Board of Governors. 
   The rate structure that helps Time-Warner will hurt the smaller publications disproportionately, according to preliminary estimates. The Nation could see mailing costs for the premier progressive publication soar by $500,000, while the conservative National Review is looking at a $100,000 spike in its costs. 
   ""The rate increase was devised by Time Warner will have an adverse effect on smaller periodicals, while easing the postal burden on the largest magazines,"" according to Free Press, an organization that has coalesced to fight the postal rate plan that it said ""goes against more than 200 years of postal policy, which has promoted the spread of diverse periodicals in competitive markets as a means to foster a free press and inform and engage citizens."" 
   As the Boston Globe concluded in an April 27 editorial, ""Congress should take a fresh look, and pursue a more public-minded rate plan.""

1729,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING IMPACT OF PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON VERMONT
  STATEMENT BY SEN. BERNIE SANDERS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET ON VERMONT:
   Thank you for being with us this morning. I am pleased to be joined by Tim Searles, the Director of the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity; Chris Foster the Interim CEO of the Vermont Food Bank, Marianne Miller, Head Start Director of the Central Vermont Community Action Agency and Nancy Thomas, Asst. Superintendent of Special Services for the Washington County Central Supervisory Union. 
   The federal budget is not just a document which adds up to trillions of dollars. It is a statement which reflects the values of our country.  
   At a time when poverty is going up, median income for working-age families is going down, and when the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider, the budget presented by President Bush last week reflected misguided values which protect the interests of the very wealthy at the expense of almost everyone else. 
   The President's budget maintains hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the wealthiest one percent of our population, while proposing harsh cutbacks in federal investments vital to the middle class, senior citizens on fixed incomes, and low-income families with children. As a Member of the Budget Committee, I will be strongly opposing the President's budget. 
   HOW WOULD THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET IMPACT VERMONT? 
   * It would prevent nearly 4,000 low-income Vermont senior citizens, mothers and newborn children from receiving the food they need to stay healthy by eliminating the $108 million Commodity Supplemental Food Program. 
   * Vermont would receive a cut of over $12 million in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program from 2006, at a time when thousands of senior citizens on fixed-incomes and low-income families with children are struggling to pay their heating bills this winter. 
   * Vermont would receive a $544,000 cut in the Weatherization Assistance Program that has helped Vermont families save money on their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. 
   * The President's proposed elimination of the $630 million Community Services Block Grant Program would result in a $3.3 million cut to the five Community Action Programs in Vermont. These programs assist thousands of Vermonters receive emergency food assistance, affordable housing, employment, and heating assistance. 
   * The President's budget proposes to cut special education grants by $393 million nationally, which would force Vermonters to pay more in property taxes to help students with disabilities. 
   * The President's proposed cut of $78 billion in Medicare and Medicaid in 2008 alone threatens to endanger Vermont's 95,000 Medicare patients' access to the care they need to lead healthy, independent lives. 
   And, on and on it goes. At the same time that the President is proposing these harsh cutbacks, he wants to provide the wealthiest three-tenth's of one percent, households with incomes of over one million per year, $739 billion in tax breaks over the next decade. The average tax break for these households would be $162,000 in 2012. That is wrong. 
   While thousands of Vermonters are struggling today to keep their heads above water economically, the last thing we need to do is extend the president's tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. What is needed in Washington is the political courage to roll-back the president's tax giveaways for the wealthiest one percent and stand-up for the middle class and working poor.

820,May 11  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Tax Reconciliation Bill of 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    The Tax Reconciliation bill in its total represents a fiscally unsound and unbalanced package that will mostly benefit the wealthiest Americans   Indeed  under this bill  the average millionaire will receive an additional  42 000 tax cut while middle income Americans will see an average of  20            It is clear that we have missed a tremendous opportunity to build on the bipartisan tax bill that passed the Senate earlier this year   We could have provided greater Alternative Minimum Tax relief  extended the college tuition deduction  or extended the research and development tax credit   Indeed  we have missed an opportunity to extend the scope and life of the refundable child credit or extend the lowered tax rates for the middle class which will help working families   And it is unfortunate that this bill keeps the billions of dollars of tax breaks for oil companies intact even as they continue to report record breaking profits while Americans are coping with staggering fuel prices           I wholeheartedly support the AMT relief provisions included in this bill and wrote to the Chairman of the Finance Committee for an even stronger AMT fix    The AMT is a growing problem in New York and throughout the country and it was my wish with this bill to build upon the bipartisan consensus to implement a long term solution for this problem          Nevertheless  I cannot support an additional  50 billion for providing even more tax cuts to the wealthiest among us   I cannot support bestowing even more benefits on the fortunate when the middle class continues to struggle with rising gasoline  health care  education and housing costs           Indeed  it has been only several months since the President signed into law the largest cuts to Medicare  Medicaid and the student loan program in history that put new burdens on our seniors  our college students and the poorest among us    As the President put pen to paper  the White House and the Republicans in Congress told those people that their sacrifice was necessary to bring the budget deficit under control   As the President  with the support of the Republicans in Congress   placed these new hardships on our seniors and working poor  he said that our fiscal condition   demanded difficult choices    and that his actions were necessary to make our economy   secure for our children and our grandchildren      But we knew then as we know now this difficult choice merely helped finance even more tax cuts for the wealthy on the backs of the most vulnerable and in most need   Instead of making our economy secure for our children and grandchildren  we will be giving them a  9 trillion debt           Moreover  it has been just a few short weeks since Congress voted to raise the national debt limit to  9 trillion   It was my hope that such a vote would convince the Republicans to choose a more fiscally responsible agenda by offering rational and pragmatic policies that would make smart investments in our workforce  our students  our infrastructure and take real steps to address our fiscal health   It was my hope that they would pay attention to the consequences created by their deficit financed tax cuts and the burdens being created for future generations in the form of trillions of dollars of debt           Unfortunately  those hopes have fallen short   In a time of war  at a time of the four largest budget deficits in the history of this country  at a time when the U S  is the most indebted nation in the world  and at a time when the middle class continues to be squeezed by stagnant wages and increased costs of living  the Republicans have once again embraced a shortsighted vision for our country  s future          ,0

                       Calls on Colleagues in Congress to prevent funds from going to Administration Initiative before proposal fully considered

                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on her colleagues in Congress to prevent funds going to a Bush Administration initiative to require passports at U S  borders  The Senator made her concerns known in a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees on Appropriation  who are currently considering the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill and have the ability to prevent funds from going to the initiative            National security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount   I have made security at New York  s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate   However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that this passport requirement would devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border     Senator Clinton wrote in her letter              Based on the immediate and dramatic response of border state residents in New York and other states to the announcement of the passport initiative several months ago  it is imperative that Congress require the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to listen closely to the voices of border state residents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce     Senator Clinton wrote          On September 1  2005  the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  announced they would be formally submitting the   Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative    for public comment   Although the Initiative has been altered to come into effect by the end of 2006 and the Department has indicated that other documents issued under various programs designed to speed border crossings will be considered  according to the DHS release announcing the comment period    the passport will be the document of choice for travel within the Western Hemisphere or re entry             Senator Clinton has expressed her serious concerns about the   Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative    since it was first previewed in April of this year  The Senator has written to both Secretary of State Rice and Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff and met with Secretary Chertoff on this critical issue          September 9  2005         Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members          As you confer on the FY06 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  I write to urge your support for inclusion of Senate Amendment 1111  sponsored by Senator Dorgan and adopted in the Senate by unanimous consent on July 14  2005  in the final conference report           This amendment addresses the proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  Initiative  planned by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    The Initiative would require all United States citizens  Canadians  citizens of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda  and citizens of Mexico to have a passport or other accepted secure document to enter or re enter the United States   The Dorgan Amendment which passed the Senate would direct that no appropriated funds under the Act can be used to promulgate regulations to implement the Initiative              National security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount   I have made security at New York  s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate   However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that this passport requirement would devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border             On April 16  2005  the Washington Post reported that President Bush expressed surprise that U S  citizens would be required to show a passport and directed that a review of the DHS initiative be undertaken to determine whether there are alternatives   While President Bush reportedly referred to the large number of crossings that would be affected in his home state of Texas  I can attest to the equally profound impact on New York State           Notwithstanding  on September 1  2005  DHS announced they are moving ahead by formally submitting the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative for public comment   Although the Initiative has been altered to come into effect a year later  by the end of 2006  and other documents issued under various programs designed to speed border crossings will be considered  according to the DHS release   the passport will be the document of choice for travel within the Western Hemisphere or re entry              The Dorgan Amendment would ensure that proper consideration is given to the impact of any new requirements on regional economies  and that a full review is conducted of acceptable alternatives   While we must do everything in our power to secure our nation  we must also take into account the very real concerns of business and residential communities along the border regarding the impact on commercial  tourist and personal traffic           Based on the immediate and dramatic response of border state residents in New York and other states to the announcement of the passport initiative several months ago  it is imperative that Congress require the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to listen closely to the voices of border state residents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce             Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0
1923,"SEN. SANDERS: PRESIDENT BUSH AWOL ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH
  The Senate is debating legislation to renew the Children's Health Insurance Program, established in 1997 to care for children in low-income families who do not qualify for Medicaid but are unable to afford private insurance. The program will expire on September 30 unless it is reauthorized by Congress. ""This debate is not just about extending health care to our children. It is about our national priorities. It is about who we are as a nation. It is about which side we are on,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said in a speech to colleagues. 
   ""For the last six years we have had a president who has in insisted, as one of his major priorities, on more and more tax breaks for the very wealthiest people in our country, people who are worth billions of dollars, people who have collectively received hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. But when it comes to those people most in need, those people who are most vulnerable, including the children of our country, the kids who are two or three years of age who have health care needs, this president tragically and embarrassingly has just not been there. If you are wealthy and powerful, he's there. If you are a child and vulnerable, he is AWOL, he's just not listening.""
   The legislation now before the Senate would invest an additional $35 billion over five years to strengthen the program's financing, increase outreach and enrollment for low-income children of the working poor; and improve the quality of health care that children receive from public programs like Medicaid and CHIP.
   Sanders would go even further. Under legislation he proposed earlier this year, all children in the United States would have access to health care, including some 9 million children who are currently uninsured.
   Vermont has been a national leader in providing health care for children, but around the country chronic budget shortfalls, confusing enrollment processes, and dramatic variation in eligibility and coverage from state to state have prevented millions of eligible children from leading healthy lives.
   ""The good news is that we in Vermont should be very proud of what we have accomplished in terms of providing health care access to our kids through the Dr. Dinosaur program. Dr. Dinosaur is far from perfect, but it has gone a long way in providing quality care to the children of our state, and makes us one for the leaders in the country in this area,"" Sanders said. ""Unfortunately, the situation throughout the rest of the country is very different. Ninety percent of the 9 million uninsured children in America live in a household in which an adult is working but still lacks health insurance for his or her child, and, believe it or not, over half of these uninsured children live in a household in which both parents are working.""

1602,July 19  2007 Senator Clinton and Representative Slaughter Introduce National Women s Rights History Project Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Rep  Louise M  Slaughter  D NY 28  today introduced the National Womens Rights History Project Act  a bill designed to provide Americans with the opportunity to learn more about the heroines who fought tirelessly to secure womens rights in the United States  The introduction of the bill coincides with the 159th anniversary of the first Womens Rights Convention in Seneca Falls  New York  which took place on July 18  1848  The National Womens Rights History Project Act is a unique opportunity to enhance public awareness and understanding of the impact of the struggle for womens rights on our lives and our nation  At the same time it is also a great opportunity to preserve our states proud heritage and to promote it to the world  New York has played such an important role in the Womens Rights Movement  from the first womens rights convention in 1848 to the continuing struggle for emancipation and freedom for all  We have a truly unique opportunity to celebrate that heritage while promoting this great state  This Act will encourage Americans of all ages to not only visit New York  but also to revisit and celebrate the role that women have played in our nations history  And by investing in these historic treasures  we can also build on the economic potential of a region where so many momentous events took place  Senator Clinton said  On this day in 1848  a group of women activists convened the first Womens Rights Convention in Seneca Falls  New York  the opening salvo of a 72 year struggle for suffrage  Rep  Slaughter said  Courageous Women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott fought tirelessly to achieve equitable rights in America  and their campaign has continued through the generations  Weve clearly come a long way since Seneca Falls  but we still have a long way to go   We must work to continue the momentum that began there  not only by ensuring that all women vote  but that they do so with an understanding of the long fight to obtain this right and with a sense of responsibility to do their part in the struggle for womens equality  Elements of the Act  The National Women s Rights History Project Act would achieve three major goals  First  the bill would establish an auto route linking New York State sites significant to the struggle for womens suffrage and civil rights  The route would be administered as part of Womens Rights National Historical Park  and the National Park Service would work to promote historically significant locations along the route  To that end  the Park Service would support the development of a guidebook  a signage system  indoor and outdoor exhibits  and interpretive and educational programs to enrich the experience of visitors  Second  the Act would expand the National Register of Historic Places  online database dedicated to women s history  Places Where Women Made History  The website currently lists locations of historical importance throughout the United States  Rep  Slaughter and Sen  Clinton s legislation will support a collaborative effort incorporating the input of state historic preservation offices nationwide so that a more comprehensive listing of women s history sites can be provided online  along with new and relevant information concerning them  Finally  the Act would require the Department of Interior to establish a partnership based network to offer financial and technical assistance for the development of educational programs focused on national womens rights history  Further Background  Following a National Park Service study requested by Rep  Slaughter examining the feasibility of establishing a Votes for Womens History Trail  Representative Slaughter introduced the Votes for Womens History Trail Act in 2002  with the goal of creating a National Park trail in upstate New York that would link the Womens Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls Waterloo  the Susan B  Anthony House in Rochester  and nearly 20 other locations  including the Michigan Street Baptist Church  the Colored Musicians Club and the Home of Mary B  Talbert in Buffalo  In 2005  Rep  Slaughter introduced the National Womens Rights History Project Act  an expanded version of the Votes for Womens History Trail Act  While continuing to recognize the significant historical sites located in Western New York  the project expanded the scope to account for sites nationwide  The introduction of this year s legislation coincides with the anniversary of a momentous day in history when a group of women s rights activists  including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott  convened the first Womens Rights Convention in Seneca Falls  NY  The Convention heralded the beginning of a 72 year struggle for womens suffrage  culminating in the 1920 ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote  Recent Work on Behalf of Women s History  Senator Clinton  Senator Clinton has long been an advocate of womens rights and the promotion of New Yorks unique place in the history of womens and workers rights  In 2003  Senator Clinton joined with Representative Slaughter to introduce the Votes for Womens History Trail Act  with the goal of creating a National Park trail in upstate New York that would link the Womens Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls Waterloo  the Susan B  Anthony House in Rochester  the Matilda Joslyn Gage House in Fayetteville  and nearly 20 other locations  Since her time as First Lady  Senator Clinton has worked to promote awareness of women s history in New York State and beyond  For example  she has proudly supported the Kate Mullany House in Troy  New York  In 1864  Ms  Mullany and 200 of her fellow female laborers organized the first women s labor union in the U S   the Collar Laundry Union  They successfully launched a strike for an increase in pay  and the Collar Laundry Union continued as an influential regional force  Senator Clinton was successful in having the Kate Mullany House dedicated as a National Historic Site in 2004  In 2003 Senator Clinton also secured  11 750 for the Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn  NY  The funds were made available under the Senate FY  04 Interior Appropriations Bill   The amount was equivalent to the additional amount of widows pension that Harriet Tubman should have received from Jan 1899 to March 1913 under various laws authorizing a pension for the death of her husband  Nelson Davis  a veteran of the Civil War   The funds were aimed at preserving and maintaining her home and to honor her memory  Senator Clinton was inducted into the National Womens Hall of Fame in 2005 and has recently worked to secure preliminary congressional approval of  250 000 for the restoration of the historic Seneca Knitting Mill  the future home of the National Women s Hall of Fame  Rep  Slaughter   Rep  Slaughter has worked for years to help ensure that due recognition is given to the women s movement in the United States  During the 150th anniversary of the first Women s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls in 1998  Rep  Slaughter organized a delegation of current and former women Members of Congress to participate in these and related events in Rochester  NY   She served as an active facilitator and advisor in planning the Seneca Falls 150th anniversary events  and joined then First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the stage to speak during the celebration s inaugural ceremonies  In July 2000  Rep  Slaughter was honored to be elected Chair of the Women s Progress Commemoration Commission  WPCC   a body created by legislation she had previously authored and successfully passed through Congress in 1998   In 2001  during the events commemorating the 153rd anniversary of the First Women s Rights Convention  Rep  Slaughter was proud to release the final report and recommendations of the WPCC at the Women s Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls  NY   The report  available here  outlined seven important steps that can be taken to preserve sites important to women s history  In Washington  Rep  Slaughter spoke in 2004 at the unveiling of the portrait of former Congresswoman Mary Norton  1875 1959   now located in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s office  The event took place during Women s History Month  Rep  Slaughter also worked to move the historic Women s Suffrage Statue of Susan B  Anthony  Lucretia Mott  and Elizabeth Cady Stanton from the Capitol s basement into the Capitol Rotunda  and spoke at a celebration

1975,"CONGRESS OVERRIDES PRESIDENT'S VETO OF WATER RESOURCES BILL
  The U.S. Senate Thursday joined the House of Representatives in overriding President Bush's veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) - the first time Congress has overridden a veto during the Bush Administration. The bipartisan Senate vote was 79 to 14 in favor of overriding the veto. 
   The bill authorizes water resources projects in Vermont and nationwide, which now will be subject to funding in the annual Appropriations process. 
   Sanders said, ""As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am delighted that Congress was able to override the president's veto in a strong, bipartisan way. This legislation lays the groundwork for vitally important ecosystem restoration projects throughout Vermont from Lake Champlain to the Connecticut River. The Water Resources Development Act also provides authority for dam construction and other projects to prevent flood damage in Vermont and across the country.""
   Reacting to the veto override, Leahy said, ""I am pleased an overwhelmingly bipartisan Senate majority overturned President Bush's veto of this bill. This is an important piece of our efforts to clean up and protect Lake Champlain and the Connecticut River. These investments support the good stewardship of our lakes and rivers that Vermonters support and deserve. The strong showing in this override vote shows that the Bush Administration's practice of snubbing domestic priorities while shoveling hundreds of billions of dollars to Iraq has its limits, even on the Republican side of the aisle. The President is out of touch with a growing bipartisan majority in the country. I hope this vote signals a turning point for the President's partisan-inspired veto threats, especially for other important upcoming legislation like the Farm Bill and all of the Appropriations bills.""
   The Vermont authorizations originated in the Senate's version of the WRDA bill and were sponsored by Leahy and Sanders. Following is a summary of the Vermont provisions:
   Vermont Highlights In The WRDA Bill
   LAKE CHAMPLAIN WATERSHED - Reauthorizes the Corps of Engineers' existing Lake Champlain restoration and remediation program. Expands the authorization to include geographic mapping activities. Increases funding authorization from $20 million to $32 million.
   LAKE CHAMPLAIN INVASIVE PLANT CONTROL - Authorizes projects to control the spread of nonnative plants in the Lake Champlain Basin.
   UPPER CONNECTICUT RIVER BASIS RESTORATION - Authorizes general management plan development and critical ecosystem restoration projects - such as stream bank stabilization, invasive species control, water quality improvement and habitat protection - in conjunction with the Upper Connecticut River Commission and the states of Vermont and New Hampshire. The bill authorizes $20 million for these efforts.
   CONNECTICUT RIVER DAMS - Authorizes projects to structurally modify dams on the Connecticut River to reduce ecological impacts. These modifications have been agreed to by the State of Vermont, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Corps of Engineers. Authorization: $30,000,000
   UPPER CONNECTICUT RIVER WETLANDS RESTORATION - Authorizes projects to restore wetlands in the Upper Connecticut River Basin, which was designated an American Heritage River in 1998. Authorization: $5,000,000
   The bill also includes a reform amendment by Welch and others to improve oversight of Army Corps of Engineers water infrastructure projects, updating guidelines that have not been changed since 1983.

               Buffalo  NY    Today Rear Admiral John E  Crowley  the new commander of the 9th Coast Guard District is visiting Buffalo   In light of his visit  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congressman Brian Higgins  NY 27  are calling for the consolidation of Coast Guard land and facilities at Sector Buffalo  opening 20 acres of land around and access to the historic Buffalo Lighthouse for public use          In a letter to Admiral Thomas H  Collins  Commandant  U S  Coast Guard  Senator Clinton and Congressman Higgins wrote that Coast Guard Sector Buffalo  as currently situated  prevents public access to a significant part of the City  s waterfront  including the Buffalo Lighthouse   They urged the Coast Guard to contribute to the momentum and economic development underway in Buffalo  and to consider the proposal discussed in March 2006 between Congressman Higgins and Rear Admiral Robert J  Papp  Jr   Commander  Ninth Coast Guard District  on Sector Buffalo land consolidation              The consolidation of these facilities could help the City of Buffalo realize the full potential of its Outer Harbor without compromising the essential security and safety role played by the Coast Guard  This is a proposal that Congressman Higgins and the people of Buffalo have been talking about for some time  I hope that Rear Admiral Crowley  while he is in Buffalo  has an opportunity to see the proposal for himself and to help us make this idea a reality     Senator Clinton said             Senator Clinton understands the importance of green space and public access along our city  s waterfront  and I am pleased to team up with her in this important initiative     said Congressman Higgins     These 20 acres would add to the momentum we  re seeing at the Outer Harbor  with full access to our historic Lighthouse without sacrificing any of the homeland security  search and rescue  navigational and other services the Coast Guard provides to Buffalo and other Lake Erie communities   The Lighthouse  the oldest public building in Buffalo  is a symbol of the waterfront  s significance in our past and will be a symbol again for our future as we focus on bringing downtown back to the waterfront               Currently the Coast Guard occupies 30 acres surrounding the Buffalo Lighthouse and limits access to parts of the Outer Harbor   The specific proposal Higgins and Admiral Papp discussed in March encourages the Coast Guard to consider consolidating its operations to ten acres  leaving 20 acres of waterfront property  including the historic lighthouse  for public access           Coast Guard Sector Buffalo is located at the head of the Niagara River and the eastern end of Lake Erie   Sector Buffalo provides search and rescue  law enforcement  aids to navigation  recreational boating safety  marine environmental response  and ice operations services to the public   Its area of responsibility includes Lake Erie from Lorain  Ohio  to Buffalo  New York  the Niagara River  Lake Ontario  the Finger Lakes  the Erie Canal  and the St  Lawrence Seaway to Massena  New York             A copy of the letter is attached          May 10  2006      Admiral Thomas H  Collins  Commandant  U S  Coast Guard  Coast Guard Headquarters  2100 Second Street  SW  Washington  DC 20593    Dear Admiral Collins     In light of Rear Admiral Crowley  s visit to Buffalo today  we are writing to endorse the consolidation of Coast Guard land and facilities at Sector Buffalo              Coast Guard Sector Buffalo currently occupies 30 acres on the Outer Harbor in the City of Buffalo   As it is currently situated  the base prevents public access to a significant portion of the City  s waterfront  including one of our community  s most historic landmarks  the Buffalo Lighthouse   Consolidating Sector Buffalo could free up to 20 acres for public green space and trails along the water  s edge  and restore public access to the Lighthouse             This proposal presents a timely opportunity for the Coast Guard to contribute to the new momentum and nascent economic development underway in Buffalo  development which is centered on our waterfront   Local officials have reached consensus on a development plan at the Inner Harbor  which will create jobs and attract investment downtown   Also  we have worked to secure funding for infrastructure to improve access to the Outer Harbor  which will attract hundreds of millions of dollars to develop our currently underutilized urban waterfront   We invite the Coast Guard to participate in this exciting development by freeing up Outer Harbor land at Sector Buffalo for public use without affecting Coast Guard security or service in the area             The search and rescue  law enforcement  homeland security  aids to navigation  recreational boating safety  marine environmental response  and ice operations services provided by Sector Buffalo are invaluable to the public and deeply appreciated   We look forward to working with you to ensure that the consolidation of Sector Buffalo will not degrade its ability to perform these essential functions           Economic development at the Outer Harbor is absolutely crucial to sustaining Buffalo  s new sense of confidence and attracting investment to our community   Thank you for your consideration of this

1942,"COSTA RICA TO BECOME FIRST COUNTRY WHERE CITIZENS CAN VOTE FOR OR AGAINST TRADE AGREEMENT
  Costa Rica on Sunday will become the first country where citizens have the opportunity to vote for or against a trade agreement. Despite being heavily outspent by the moneyed interests, despite opposition from the Costa Rican government and the U.S. ambassador, despite an extremely hostile media, the latest polls show momentum building for the opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement. The Wall Street Journal editorial page, the voice for the wealthy and powerful in the United States, twice this week took on Senator Bernie Sanders in a column and editorial about the Costa Rica referendum. The Journal also published the senator's response.
   While I strongly disagree with The Wall Street Journal editorial page's right-wing ideology, I'll give you points for persistence. Year after year, despite all of the evidence, you continue to be a cheerleader for the unfettered free-trade policies that, while benefiting multinational corporations, have caused so much economic pain for working families here in the U.S. and our trading partners abroad. 
   Ms. O'Grady is telling the people of Costa Rica how wonderful passage of the Central American Free Trade Agreement will be for them. The Journal said the exact same thing to the people of Mexico during the 1993 debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement. And what happened with the passage of Nafta? In Mexico, the agricultural sector has been decimated by cheap exports from American agribusiness. Poverty has increased, the middle class has declined and people are literally dying in the desert trying to flee Mexico for the U.S.
   Working families in Mexico suffer, the rich have gotten richer and we now have the obscenity of the wealthiest person in the world, Mexican Carlos Slim Helu, coming from a country in which millions of families struggle to feed their children. This may be the kind of economic development championed by you, but not by me. We can have trade policies that can do better, that must do better.
   It's not only Mexico and other developing countries that have been hurt by these unfettered pro-corporate free-trade agreements. It's also the working families in the U.S. who are now engaged in a horrendous ""race to the bottom.""
   Despite an explosion of technology and a huge increase in worker productivity, poverty in America is increasing, the middle class is shrinking, and the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider. In the past six years, millions of good-paying jobs in the U.S. have been lost as companies shut down here and move to China and other low-wage countries. During that same period, median household income for working-age families has declined by about $2,500, 8.6 million Americans have lost their health insurance, three million have lost their pensions, and millions are working longer hours for lower wages. Meanwhile, the gap between the rich and the poor in the U.S. is now the highest of any industrialized country and greater than at any time since the 1920s.
   On Oct. 7, Costa Rica will become the first country where citizens have the opportunity to vote for or against a trade agreement. Despite being heavily outspent by the moneyed interests, despite opposition from the Costa Rican government and the U.S. ambassador, despite an extremely hostile media, the latest polls have the election as a toss-up. Incredibly, just the other day, in a nation of only four million people, well over 100,000 marched in opposition to the treaty -- a sign of the deep grassroots opposition there to Cafta.
   Notwithstanding Ms. O'Grady's assertions, my recent trip to Costa Rica was not about telling the people there how to vote. That's their business, not mine. The trip that Rep. Mike Michaud and I made was to help counter the lies being spread in Costa Rica that suggested that if the people there, exercising their democratic rights, voted ""no"" on Cafta, the U.S. government would punish them by excluding them from the Caribbean Basin Initiative as well as other punitive actions.
   The Journal and I may disagree on the merits of unfettered free trade, but there should be no disagreement that when the people in a free, democratic and independent country like Costa Rica vote their conscience they should not be punished by the world's superpower. That is not what democracy is about.

   Obama Statement on Visit of Polish President Lech Kaczynski Monday  July 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on the visit of Polish President Lech Kaczynski to the United States       I welcome Polish President Lech Kaczynski to Washington   Recognizing the rich history of cooperation between our two countries  I am happy to say  Witam Serdecznie w Washingtonie  Welcome to Washington           The Polish President s visit reminds us that for the last 200 years America and Poland have been linked in the struggle for freedom   Today there is a strong legacy of sacrifice between the two nations     sacrifice for the cause of American and Polish freedom alike          As early as the Revolutionary War  Polish patriots like Casimir Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko fought alongside American patriots     from Germantown to Saratoga     to help win our country   s independence          During World War I  Ignacy Paderewski  an unparalleled musician  helped lead the fight for a free and independent Poland   He became Prime Minister after the war  only to be forced into exile by the Nazi Occupation   After he died in exile in the United States  America gave this great friend of freedom a place alongside our honored dead in Arlington National Cemetery  There he would rest  in the words of President Franklin Roosevelt     until Poland would be free             It was a moving sight when  in 1992  President George H  W  Bush escorted Paderewski s ashes home to Poland   No one will forget seeing thousands of Poles lining the streets over the miles from the airport to the city center  waiting to see the horse drawn carriage          It was the world   s good fortune that a Pole infused with this same dedication to freedom and the dignity of all people was elected Pope at such a critical time   Polish Americans were thrilled at the election of Karol Wojtyla as Pope  a man who kept the faith when faith was forbidden          At the same time  American Polonia   s dedication to freedom in their native Poland was vital in ensuring that Soviet totalitarianism would not succeed   Millions of personal packages were sent to friends and family back home  and each package was a message of hope in dark days     like the imposition of Martial Law in 1981     of the Soviet Union          The razing of the Iron Curtain provided opportunities to renew the linkage between Poland and America   Two centuries after the deaths of Pulaski and Kosciuszko  Poland and America became formal allies in NATO  institutionalizing the faith in freedom our countries have shared for centuries          Since joining NATO in 1997  Poland has become one of America   s most important strategic partners  dedicating troops and resources to our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq          We now have an opportunity to build on this long and deep relationship   Here is how we can      1  Renew the unity of purpose of the Transatlantic Relationship      The Bush Administration s policy of splitting Europe into    old    and    new    was not just wrong  it was counterproductive   Poland should not have to choose between its vital interest in closer integration with Europe and its alliance with the United States   America must repair its relationship with Europe as a whole  so that Poland and our other Central European allies are never put in that position again      2  Finish building a Europe whole and free      Poland has been a steadfast champion of liberty in the countries to its east   America and Poland should stand together to help Ukraine build a strong and stable democracy  and to help the people of Belarus regain their human rights   We also share an interest in working with Russia to meet common security threats and to encourage Russia   s integration into Western institutions   But we should also embrace  not abandon  those in Russia working to preserve their hard won liberty  and draw clear lines against Russia   s intimidation of its neighbors   21st Century Europe cannot be divided into 19th Century spheres of influence     3  Meet global challenges together       Not long ago  we looked to Poland as a country that needed American help in its own efforts to be free and secure  now we look to Poland as a critical partner in building a safer  freer world    We should work with Poland to secure more European troops  with stronger rules of engagement  to stabilize Afghanistan   And we should work together to send an unmistakable signal to Iran that its insistence in pursuing a nuclear weapons program is a profound mistake      4  Energize the alliance to confront new challenges      From Poland to the United States  we are facing a new kind of threat     in the form of energy insecurity and climate change   The North Atlantic community has always joined forces to confront and defeat new challenges  and we should be doing the same now by  among other things  sharing best practices on energy conservation  inviting India and China to join the International Energy Agency  and dedicating our significant resources to establishing a global cap and trade on greenhouse gas pollution      5  Prudently but decisively prepare for emerging threats      The Bush Administration has been developing plans to deploy interceptors and radar systems in Poland and the Czech Republic as part of a missile defense system designed to protect against the potential threat of Iranian nuclear armed missiles   If we can responsibly deploy missile defenses that would protect us and our allies we should     but only when the system works   We need to make sure any missile defense system would be effective before deployment   The Bush Administration has in the past exaggerated missile defense capabilities and rushed deployments for political purposes  The Bush Administration has also done a poor job of consulting its NATO allies about the deployment of a missile defense system that has major implications for all of them   We must not allow this issue to divide    new Europe    and    old Europe     as the Bush Administration tried to do over Iraq       6  Invite Poland to join the Visa Waiver Program      We should work to include countries like Poland that are members of both the EU and NATO into the Visa Waiver Program   Today   s visa regime reflects neither the current strategic relationship nor the close historic bonds between our peoples  and is out of date         These are important steps  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to implement them          It is wonderful to welcome the Polish President at a time in which America and Poland share the same

1221,November 15  2005 Joint Statement by Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Chuck Schumer on the Failure of the Joint House Senate Conference Committee to Restore 9 11 Aid For New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC     We are extremely disappointed that the Joint House Senate Labor  HHS Conference Committee is poised to reject a provision that passed the Senate which would restore  125 million in 9 11 aid to those in need of worker  s compensation and medical and mental health needs because the House Republican Leadership refuses to permit this funding to be added to the bill   This money would have gone to our firefighters  police officers  workers  volunteers  and others who came to Ground Zero and who need our help   Many House Members and Senators visited Ground Zero shortly after September 11th and stood with our heroes   But there were thousands of men and women who worked at Ground Zero for several days  weeks and months beyond September 11th looking for their brothers and sisters  friends and families  and those they did not even know   Many of them still suffer medical and mental health problems and worker  s compensation claims are not being approved or addressed   The Amendment we included in this bill would have addressed these problems   While we are extremely disappointed that this provision is in jeopardy  this fight is not over   We will not abandon these men and women who did not abandon us in our time of need   The President of the United States  and this Congress  promised  20 billion to New York and rejecting this provision is a rejection of that promise   It is only right that we restore this funding to New York and we will do whatever is in our power to right this wrong            ,0
1690,May 1  2007 Senator Clinton Joins Bipartisan Call for China to Help End the Crisis in Darfur

                Washington  DC   Continuing her efforts to push for an end to the genocide in Darfur  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined a bipartisan group of senators in calling on China to step up pressure on Sudan to end the crisis in Darfur that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced millions more   In a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao  the senators outlined the need for China to impress upon Sudanese President al Bashir the need to halt Sudan s military operations throughout Darfur  accept a robust African Union United Nations  AU UN  peacekeeping force  and ensure humanitarian assistance can be provided safely             As an emerging world leader  China has an important role to play in ensuring the Sudanese government takes measures to immediately end the violence in Darfur  China must accept the full African Union United Nations peacekeeping force and facilitate humanitarian assistance   said Senator Clinton   The international community is increasingly looking for China to demonstrate the will and the leadership that is so critical to resolving this crisis  I hope China will use its significant influence to do the right thing           The letter to President Hu urges the Chinese government to work together with the international community to send a clear message to Sudan that it must embrace a path to peace and reconciliation by complying with current UN Security Council resolutions and the UN brokered ceasefire   In addition  the letter calls for the Chinese government to reconsider its decision to provide the government of Sudan with an interest free loan to build a presidential palace  The letter requests that President Hu share information with the United States Senate as to what actions China intends to take to protect civilians in Darfur           Since 2004  Senator Clinton has called repeatedly for action in Darfur  Most recently  Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter to President Bush calling for greater action by the UN Security Council against Sudan  She also co sponsored a resolution calling on the United States Government and the international community to develop  fund  and implement a comprehensive regional strategy in Africa to protect civilians  facilitate humanitarian operations  contain and reduce violence  and contribute to conditions for sustainable peace in Darfur  as well as in eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic  and Darfur  Sudan  S Res 76    S  Res  76 passed the Senate earlier this month          The full text of the letter to President Hu follows             His Excellency Hu Jintao  c o Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong  Embassy of the People s Republic of China  2300 Connecticut Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20008      Dear President Hu       We write to request your assistance on a matter of grave mutual concern requiring urgent action            The devastating crisis in western Sudan has escalated despite United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706  and the subsequent agreement brokered by the United Nations late last year in Addis Ababa to establish a joint African Union UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur   Simply put  the African Union Mission in Sudan  AMIS  has not had the troop level  financial resources  institutional capacity or mandate to protect civilians or humanitarian organizations in Darfur    Sudanese President Omar al Bashir recently sent a disturbing letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon in which he backed away from the Addis agreement to implement phases II and III  the heavy support package and a robust UN peacekeeping force   Last week  he apparently reversed himself and agreed to move forward with the heavy support package  but given his record of stonewalling we need to keep the pressure on until peacekeepers are actually deployed   It is also essential that President Bashir s decision to allow the second phase of the U N  deployment not be used as a rationale for Khartoum s rejection of the full hybrid AU UN force authorized in UNSC Resolution 1706          The conflict waged by Sudanese government forces and government backed Janjawid militias against armed rebel groups has driven more than 230 000 Darfuri refugees into Chad  and displaced more than 120 000 Chadians   Hundreds of thousands of Darfuri civilians have been killed and an estimated 2 million displaced in Darfur itself   The conflict has had particularly devastating consequences for women and children  who make up the vast majority of victims  Humanitarian operations have also been increasingly attacked and disrupted in recent months  leaving millions without access to the most basic assistance          We appreciate the steps the international community and China have taken to confront war crimes and other egregious human rights violations in Darfur   The President s Special Envoy for Sudan  Andrew Natsios  recently told Congress that China may have been  the critical factor  in Sudan s decision to accept important portions of the Kofi Annan plan   That is an important contribution   By continuing to work together  in our complementary ways  the United States and China can achieve more   In this regard we urge China to reassess its recent decision to provide the Government of Sudan with an interest free loan to build a presidential palace   We believe extending such a loan would clearly send the wrong message to Khartoum   We hope that you will reconsider the loan and impress upon President al Bashir the need to halt Sudan s military operations throughout Darfur  to withdraw Sudanese troops from the area  and to follow through on its agreement to accept a robust AU UN peacekeeping force in Darfur   These steps  at a minimum  are essential to enforce the ceasefire  protect civilians  ensure access to humanitarian assistance  and begin the path to reconstruction and reconciliation in Darfur          As Members of the U S  Senate  our primary objectives in this endeavor  and those of our constituents across the United States  are to protect civilians in Darfur  end the violence  find a just resolution to the political conflict  and begin the long path to reconstruction and reconciliation          We must now work together as an international community  there is no time left to wait   We therefore appeal to you today to use your influence in words and in deeds to protect civilians   China has a lead role to play in ensuring that President al Bashir accept the best and most reasonable path to peace  and that he agree to move forward with the heavy support package and the full contingent of UN peacekeepers and related personnel in Darfur   We would appreciate any information you can share on actions China intends to take to protect civilians in Darfur          Sincerely            Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the crisis in Darfur          ,0
1855,"SENATE BOOSTS COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, SANDERS ENVISIONS SERVICE THROUGHOUT VERMONT
  The Senate last night passed the largest increase in the history of the Community Health Center Program. 
   Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is a leading advocate for the program and fought for the $250 million increase in funding.
   ""In Vermont in recent years, we have expanded the number of health centers from two to six, and my hope is that we can add an additional three or four more centers in the next three years. These centers now serve over 86,000 Vermonters. They provide quality health care, quality dental care, low cost prescription drugs, and mental health counseling in some 23 different locations around the state of Vermont. The centers are the medical home for 24 percent of Vermont's Medicaid beneficiaries and serve 19 percent of our uninsured,"" said Sanders.
   ""Nationally, health centers not only efficiently provide quality care in underserved communities, they are filling a major gap in our nation's health care system where primary care is becoming a lost profession. It is no secret that in many parts of America, especially rural America, it is very, very hard for people to find a primary care physician.
   ""Health centers provide access to quality health services for all, regardless of families' ability to pay. Everyone knows there are huge gaps in America's health care system. Millions of Americans do not get the preventative care they need to stave off future illness. Millions of Americans skip routine check ups because they can't afford them,"" said Sanders.
   The increased level of support the Senate approved would finance roughly 500 new or expanded health centers, serving an additional 2 million people nationally. More than 16 million Americans currently benefit from these health centers.
   For an average federal grant expenditure of $124 per patient, per year, the centers offer comprehensive medical, dental, and mental health services to all, regardless of their ability to pay. The Office of Management and Budget has cited the program as one of the most efficient in the use of taxpayer dollars.
   The health center funding was included in an appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

6,   Legislation to Increase Availability and Use of Renewable Fuels  Decrease U S  Dependence on Foreign Oil   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Legislation to Increase Availability and Use of Renewable Fuels  Decrease U S  Dependence on Foreign Oil Friday  January  5  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Lugar Contact  Andy Fisher   202  224 2079  Harkin Contact  Tom Reynolds   202  228 2674  Date  January 5  2007  Obama  Lugar  Harkin Introduce Legislation to Increase Availability and Use of Renewable Fuels  Decrease U S  Dependence on Foreign Oil   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard Lugar  R IN  and Tom Harkin  D IA  announced today that they have introduced comprehensive legislation to both increase the production of renewable fuels like ethanol  and make that expanded volume of fuel more widely available to motorists nationwide      To become truly energy independent  we need not only to increase domestic production of renewable fuels like ethanol  but also make sure that the pumps are widely available to distribute the fuel and that automakers produce more vehicles that can use the fuel   Obama said   This legislation will greatly reduce our dependence on foreign oil and strengthen farm income by increasing both supply of and demand for biofuels      U S  policies should be targeted to replace hydrocarbons with carbohydrates  Obviously this is not a short term proposition  but we can off set a significant portion of demand for oil by giving American consumers a real choice of automotive fuel   This bill will help tilt our energy balance toward alternative fuels  moving these fuels into additional markets and making them more widely available for consumers   said Lugar     As a matter of national security  I believe we must wean ourselves off our dependence on foreign oil   Harkin said   We as a nation should be doing more to accelerate the development and use of clean  domestic renewable energy  This bill directly addresses one of the most critical pieces of a strong national energy transition policy     The American Fuels Act of 2007 would help greatly decrease U S  dependence on foreign oil by increasing production  distribution and consumption of renewable fuels  The bill would increase production by mandating an increase in the creation of biodiesel  and by providing tax credits to spur new investment in cellulosic biomass fuels  which are considered the next generation in renewable fuels    It would also create a robust biofuel distribution network by ensuring that oil companies aren t prohibiting the sale of renewable fuels  and would provide a tax credit that would encourage more ethanol producers to blend and sell their fuels on site without the added cost of shipping the ethanol to oil refineries    Finally  the bill would increase the use of renewable fuels by providing tax credits to increase production of ethanol capable vehicles  requiring the entire federal vehicle fleet to be fuel efficient by 2014  and requiring buses purchased with federal funds to use clean technologies    The legislation will work in concert with legislation introduced yesterday by Senators Obama  Harkin  Lugar  Byron Dorgan  D ND  and Joe Biden  D DE  that would increase the supply and demand for renewable fuels by blending 60 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel in the United States motor vehicle fuel supply annually by the year 2030                                     ,1
944,September 12  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on Feds to Provide Funding to Control the Spread of the Deadly Fish Disease  VHS  in Great Lakes Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined several of her colleagues in urging the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry to provide assistance in the upcoming 2007 Farm Bill to states whose aquaculture and fishing industries have been blighted by the deadly fish disease  Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia  VHS   In a letter to Committee Chairman Tom Harkin and Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss  the lawmakers stressed the need for language to be included in the Farm Bill that would ensure assistance is provided to Great Lakes states for testing  monitoring  and enforcement of VHS guidelines    The effort made by the USDA and APHIS in combating the spread of VHS and other animals and diseases that threaten the Great Lakes and many smaller New York water bodies is encouraging  but I am still very concerned about the negative impact that the virus continues to have on the environment and on businesses in our state  said Senator Clinton  The APHIS order simply did not provide the necessary resources to get the job done  and it is unfair to think that states like New York should shoulder the entire burden of testing  monitoring  and enforcement  Our fisheries and marine industries are vital to New Yorks economic wellbeing  and that requires maintaining a healthy ecosystem in the Great Lakes  Adding language to the Farm Bill that authorizes assistance to states like New York that border the Great Lakes is critical in controlling the VHS problem     In October 2006  the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  issued an order to prevent the spread of VHS  which stopped the interstate movement within the Great Lakes states of more than 3 dozen species of live fish that are susceptible to the disease  However  these states do not have adequate capacity to perform the necessary quantity of testing in an expeditious and efficient manner  and the APHIS order did not provide any assistance to states to help with required testing  monitoring  and enforcement  As such all of these responsibilities have been placed on the Great Lakes states and tribal management authorities  The authorization of additional federal funds will provide the necessary assistance to states and monitoring agencies that are working to isolate  and curb the spread of the disease in the Great Lakes region    A copy of the letter to Senators Harkin and Chambliss is attached    September 11  2007   The Honorable Tom Harkin  Chairman  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  328A Russell Senate Office Bldg   Washington  DC  20510 The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  328A Russell Senate Office Bldg   Washington  DC  20510    Dear Mr  Chairman and Ranking Member    In October 2006  the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  issued an order to prevent the spread of a very deadly fish disease called viral hemorrhagic septicemia  VHS    This disease and efforts to contain it have had serious impacts on our aquaculture and fishing industries  and we are writing to ask that you include authority in the upcoming 2007 Farm Bill to provide assistance to states for monitoring  testing  and enforcement    The 2006 order stopped the interstate movement within the Great Lakes states of more than 3 dozen species of live fish that are susceptible to VHS   If fish are certified to be VHS free  they may be shipped across state lines   Unfortunately  the Great Lakes states do not have sufficient testing facility capacity to test the volume of samples in a timely way   When APHIS issued the order  it did not provide any assistance to states to help with testing  monitoring and enforcement   Further  the Office of Management and Budget recently denied a request by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to use Commodity Credit Corporation  CCC  emergency money for cooperative agreements between the USDA and state agencies to conduct surveillance in order to determine the geographic and species distribution of the disease and to establish an education campaign focused on recreational activities which might spread the disease and on compliance of the current order   Therefore  all of these responsibilities would be placed on the Great Lakes states and tribal management authorities    We want to ensure that VHS is contained and perhaps even cured  and we hope that this can be done without severe economic impacts to the aquaculture industry  states  or tribal management authorities   We believe that the needed authority which will provide assistance to states for monitoring  testing  curing and enforcement  and we urge you to include this language in your legislation      Sincerely    Debbie Stabenow

growing numbers of grandparents and other relative caregivers raising children   Emphasizing the need to remove barriers that too often confront kinship caregivers  Senator Clinton announced that she has re introduced legislation in the Senate to provide needed assistance to kinship caregivers and enable kinship care for more children who otherwise would be in foster care           So many grandparents and other relatives are making great personal sacrifices to provide safe and loving homes for the children in their care  These guardians often take on this responsibility unexpectedly  facing physical  emotional  and financial challenges   said Senator Clinton    Too often  the deck is stacked against these caring relatives  difficulties gaining formal custody of the children in their care  enrolling children in school  authorizing medical treatment  retaining public housing  getting affordable legal services  and  accessing benefits that could help them provide care   By taking common sense steps  we can remove these unnecessary barriers and address the unique challenges facing kinship caregivers struggling to do the right thing for our children   said Senator Clinton

children   1 in 12   are living in households headed by grandparents or other relatives   In New York City alone  there are over 245 000 adolescents living in grandparent headed households   Across New York  more than 400 000 children   more than nine percent of the children in the state   live in households headed by a grandparent or other relative according to the most recent data available from the U S  Census Bureau   An estimated 20 000 children living in foster care across the country could leave the system if Congress made subsidized guardianship available to their families           Senator Clinton s legislation  the Kinship Caregiver Support Act  will establish a Kinship Navigator Program in states  large metropolitan areas and Indian tribal organizations to assist kinship caregivers in navigating needed programs and services   The program will provide families with the guidance they need to obtain health care coverage for the children in their care  apply for housing assistance  locate childcare  enroll children in school  and gain access to other services           The bill also will establish a Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program to provide federal assistance to states for subsidized guardianship programs to better serve the needs of kinship care families and make it possible for grandparents and other relatives who become kinship caregivers to receive the same subsidy a foster family would receive   Currently  kinship caregivers are not eligible to receive such a subsidy to help provide for a child who would otherwise be in foster care          In addition  Senator Clinton s legislation will ensure notice is given to relatives when children enter foster care   Unfortunately  grandparents and other relatives often do not know when their grandchildren or nieces and nephews come under the care of the State  Notifying grandparents and other relatives when children enter the foster care system will make it easier for families to stay together          Senator Clinton introduced the bipartisan Kinship Caregiver Support Act along with Senator Olympia Snowe  R ME  in the 108th and 109th Congresses and will continue to press for passage of the legislation  Supporters of the legislation include  Generations United  the Children s Defense Fund  the Child Welfare League of America  the AARP  the National Black Caucus of State Legislators  the Center for Law and Social Policy  CLASP   Grandparents for Children s Rights  the Kids are Waiting Campaign and the Evan P  Donaldson Adoption Institute      The Kinship Caregiver Support Act  Fact Sheet   The Rise of Kinship Caregiver Families      Nationwide  more than 6 million children  that is  1 in 12 children  are living in households headed by grandparents or other relatives  i e    kinship caregivers             The 2005 U S  Census Bureau American Community Survey shows 279 899 children in grandparent headed homes in New York and another 138 750 children living in other relative headed homes  That makes a total of 418  649   more than 9 percent of children in the state          Kinship caregivers  who often become parents unexpectedly  face unique challenges to successfully raising children  including difficulties enrolling children in school  authorizing medical treatment  maintaining their public housing leases  obtaining affordable legal services  and accessing a variety of federal benefits and services   Almost one fifth of grandparents responsible for their grandchildren live in poverty       The Bill      The Kinship Caregiver Support Act attempts to address the full range of emotional  physical and financial difficulties facing children and kinship caregivers so that relatives may become formal guardians and at the same time receive some financial assistance  It takes three important steps to assist children being raised and cared for by kinship caregivers  Specifically  the bill               Establishes a Kinship Navigator Program in states  large metropolitan areas  and Indian tribal organizations to assist kinship caregivers to navigate their way through existing programs and services  This program will provide families with the guidance they need to learn how to obtain health care coverage for them  apply for housing assistance  locate childcare  enroll them in school  and gain access to other services               Establishes a Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program to provide federal assistance to states for subsidized guardianship programs to better serve the needs of kinship care families  This provision gives states the option to use their Title IV E funds to provide payments to grandparents and other relatives who have assumed legal guardianship of children they ve cared for as foster parents               Ensures notice to relatives when children enter foster care to make it easier for families to stay together          The new version of this bill strengthens systems already in place to support these families by               Expanding eligibility for the Foster Care Independence Program so Education and Training Vouchers  ETV  are available to young people who exit foster care after age 16 to guardianship just as young people exiting adoption can receive these vouchers               Strengthening requirements for collaboration in Navigator grants to address the link between incarcerated parents and kinship caregivers       Support      Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Olympia Snowe  R ME  have introduced this legislation in the last two Congresses  Senator Thad Cochran  R MS  was also an original co sponsor  In the 109th Congress  the following Members were also co sponsors  Senators Coleman  Jeffords  Johnson  Kerry  Landrieu  Lautenberg  Obama and Schumer          Groups supporting the bill include  Generations United  the Children s Defense Fund  the Child Welfare League of America  the AARP  the National Black Caucus of

1863,"SEN. SANDERS COSPONSORS THE DECENT WORKING CONDITIONS AND FAIR COMPETITION ACT
  A Senate subcommittee on Thursday held a hearing on Sweatshop Conditions in the Chinese Toy Industry. Americans spent $22.3 billion on toys and sporting goods last year, and China accounted for 86 percent of U.S. toy imports, according to Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee. ""Many parents in America would be shocked and disturbed if they knew of the abusive sweatshop conditions under which their children's toys are being made in China,"" he testified. ""Parents, however, have no way of knowing, as toy companies like Mattel (the largest in the world) hide their 40 or so contract plants in China, refusing to provide the American people with even the names and addresses of their plants."" Senator Bernie Sanders is a cosponsor of the Decent Working Conditions and Fair Competition Act that would make it unlawful to sell, trade, or advertise sweatshop goods.

additional oversight  answers from GAO   WASHINGTON  DC     Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to open an investigation into Medicare Advantage

deceptive sales practices  and providing poor customer service    Below is the text of Senator Obama s letter    October 8  2007   The Honorable David M  Walker   Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office   441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548    Dear Mr  Walker    I am writing to request that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  immediately open an investigation into the exploitation of senior citizens by private insurers participating in the Medicare Advantage program     According to an analysis by the New York Times  tens of thousands of Medicare recipients have been the victims of deceptive sales practices by these private insurance companies  had claims improperly denied or denied without explanation  and received poor customer service in trying to get their questions answered   In some cases  the practices of these companies were found to have affected the health of patients by delaying access to urgently needed health care services and medications      Medicare has been a successful program for four decades  in part because it has been free of such practices   And if this is the price of introducing private insurers into the system  the cost for America and our senior citizens is too high    Among the examples of problems identified by these audits were    UnitedHealth and Humana denied claims without giving any explanation to beneficiaries   WellPoint had a backlog of 354 000 claims  its call center required an average of 27 minutes to answer phone calls from beneficiaries and 16 minutes to answer calls from providers  and more than half of the callers hung up without speaking to a customer service representative   Sierra Health Services stopped drug coverage for 2 300 beneficiaries with HIV AIDS when the company mistakenly thought that the beneficiaries had not paid their premiums   and  Humana had so many complaints about its marketing practices that it could not investigate all of them     Other news stories in recent months have detailed how insurance companies aggressively market private Medicare plans to seniors   in some cases even forging their signatures and providing false information   What is particularly egregious is that these private plans receive higher subsidies for services than under traditional Medicare   The Medicare Payment Admission Commission recently reported that on average the government pays 12 percent more to private Medicare plans than it costs to treat comparable beneficiaries through traditional Medicare   These excessive subsidies cost the government billions of dollars every year    Given the popularity of Medicare Advantage plans     enrollment has increased to 8 7 million from 5 3 million in 2003     it is important to ensure these companies are providing the services for which they are reimbursed   This year  the federal government will pay private insurers  76 3 billion for participating in the Medicare Advantage program   I am pleased that GAO has already started this oversight process as evidenced by a July 2007 report finding that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services was not complying with a requirement that it audit the financial records of one third of participating companies      However  I believe that GAO needs to conduct additional oversight into how America  s senior citizens are treated by these private companies   Specifically  I believe that GAO should open an investigation into the following    The extent of deceptive practices in the marketing of Medicare Advantage programs   Whether beneficiaries are wrongly being denied needed health care services and medications   Whether the claims of beneficiaries are being improperly denied or denied without sufficient explanation  The speed with which appeals of claims denials are considered   Whether customer service representatives are responsive to the questions and concerns of beneficiaries  and  Whether additional safeguards are necessary to protect beneficiaries     Given the seriousness of this issue and its effect on America  s senior citizens  I appreciate your prompt attention to this request   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,1
1108,January 14  2005 Schumer  Clinton  Slaughter  Reynolds and  Higgins Call on Department of Labor to  Look Harder for Bethlehem Steel Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Letter Asks Department to Follow Leads Identified  in Recent Draft Audit of Bethlehem Steel Site Profile

                    Washington  DC   Senators Chuck Schumer  NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  were joined by Representatives Louise Slaughter  NY   Tom Reynolds  NY  and Brian Higgins  NY  in writing to the Department of Labor  DOL  to request an immediate search for additional records about uranium rollings conducted at the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna  NY during the 1950s         Under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA   DOL has the responsibility to set eligibility dates for former Bethlehem Steel workers by determining when uranium was rolled at the plant  In spite of former workers  assertions that uranium rollings took place in 1955 and 1956  DOL has denied the EEOICPA claims of workers employed during these years  stating that no relevant records have been found        However  a recent draft audit of the Bethlehem Steel  site profile   conducted by Sanford Cohen and Associates  points to several places where records of Bethlehem Steel uranium rollings might be found  Specifically  the draft audit points to Department of Energy facilities at Savannah River  Hanford and the Chalk River Reactor as well the Bethlehem Steel facility in Saylorsville  Pennsylvania  The letter asks DOL to immediately search these facilities or to release information showing that they have done so already  In addition  the letter asks DOL to answer several questions about the methods and information they used to arrive at the eligibility dates for Bethlehem Steel          The Department of Labor should leave no stone unturned in the search for Bethlehem Steel records   said Senator Clinton   We need to be able to assure Bethlehem Steel workers and their survivors that we have looked in every possible place for records of the uranium rollings          The Department of Labor needs to step up its efforts now to find each and every piece of evidence that will help these workers get the money they deserve   Senator Schumer said   These workers can t wait another minute to find information that could make a difference to their claims           Workers have steadfastly maintained they rolled uranium at Bethlehem Steel in 1955 and 1956  The Labor Department can t say it didn t happen if they haven t bothered to investigate  The United States government has a responsibility to the people of New York to conduct a full and thorough investigation  Anything less is simply indefensible   Congresswoman Slaughter said         No one who deserves compensation should have it denied  period   said Congressman Reynolds   These records could provide many of the answers needed to ensure the compensation that these these veterans of the cold war deserve  Furthermore  it will show that the federal government will leave no stone unturned to ensure we meet our responsibility  and provide fairness to these workers and their families           This is the next step to make sure that our affected constituents get the consideration they deserve   said Congressman Brian Higgins   I am proud to be united with my colleagues in the Western New York Congressional Delegation in our effort to ensure that the Department of Labor does not leave anyone out          The full text of the letter follows        January 14  2005       Mr  Shelby Hallmark  Director  Office of Workers  Compensation Programs  U S  Department of Labor  200 Constitution Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20210       Dear Mr  Hallmark        The Department of Labor  DOL  stated in its recent DOL Comments on the SC Audit of the Bethlehem Steel Site Profile that they are  responsible for establishing the time period for which a  covered facility  is deemed covered          During the December 2004 meeting of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health in Livermore  CA  it was reported that DOL has adjudicated and denied claims for compensation submitted under Subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  that are based on exposure during alleged uranium rollings during the 1955 1956 time period at the Bethlehem Steel facility in Lackawanna  NY        The Sanford Cohen and Associates  Inc   SC  audit team  in their review of the Bethlehem Steel site profile  stated that   A comprehensive records search of relevant rolling operations documents was not performed to investigate worker testimony regarding additional rollings after 1952   The audit team recommended that NIOSH direct a further investigation into the statements by the appropriate agency         Additionally  recently discovered records from the Hanford facility provide valuable supporting documentation for Bethlehem Steel  as evident by their inclusion in the references of the audit report  In light of the discovery of records at Hanford  SC recommended that a further search of records be completed at Hanford and that similar searches be completed for the MCW  SRS and Chalk River facilities  as they either provided uranium for rolling or received the finished product from Bethlehem Steel  The audit team also recommended that the Bethlehem Steel records repository in Saylorsville  PA  Be searched for evidence of rolling history        In light of these audit findings and recommendations  we request the following information and actions be taken with respect to the Bethlehem Steel facility        1  Please describe the investigative process that DOL follows with regard to Subtitle B claims asserting that there were covered activities outside of the time periods listed in the Federal Register notices published periodically by the Department of Energy  DOE         2  With respect to the DOL s process  please provide the factual basis for the denials of claims related to reports that there were rollings at Bethlehem Steel in 1955 and 1956        3  Please provide a description of the inquiry undertaken by DOL  or requests for investigations by DOE or NIOSH  to determine if rollings took place in 1955 56  Please attach copies of emails  letters  and reports from DOE field offices that describe the specific efforts undertaken and by whom this research was conducted  Please provide copies of all documents that were recovered        4  Did DOL or other federal agencies  such as DOE  direct a review of uranium shipment records at Savannah River  Hanford and the Chalk River Reactor to determine if shipments were made from Bethlehem Steel  or an intermediary  to these three facilities in 1955 56  If so  please provide copies of documents  If not  we urge DOL to initiative such a review immediately  as we note that DOE has uncovered a significant amount of shipment data in connection with its mass balance report on recycled uranium         5  Did DOL or another federal agency  including the DOE  make an inquiry to Bethlehem Steel to determine if they have pertinent records related to additional rollings  and to request a search of their Saylorsville  PA records facility  If not  we urge DOL to initiate such an inquiry immediately  We note that DOL now possesses new subpoena authority through amendments to the FY 05 Defense Authorization Act  P L  108 375  which will allow DOL to compel production of records        We respectfully request that you make this information available to us and the public at the earliest opportunity  We also request that DOL initiate any unperformed review or inquiry described above that might uncover information about uranium rollings after 1952  These actions and information are critical to Bethlehem Steel claimants  as evidenced by the strong turnout and comments at the NIOSH public meeting on January 12 in Cheektowaga  NY  The public deserves to be assured that DOL has taken all possible steps to attain information about uranium rollings at Bethlehem Steel  and to be fully informed about the factual basis DOL is using for uranium         Please contact any of our offices in regards to this request        Sincerely            ,0

1771,"SENS. SANDERS, LEAHY VOTE, AGAIN, TO PULL TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ
  The Senate voted Wednesday on legislation - cosponsored by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy - to redeploy U.S. forces from Iraq. ""Tragically, President Bush and his blind loyalists continue to ignore reality and refuse to change course in Iraq,"" Sanders said. The amendment was defeated, but the mounting movement to end the war was not. ""We need to keep pushing, step by step, until we succeed in getting our troops out of the middle of Iraq's civil war,"" Leahy said 
   The legislation called for bringing our troops home within four months and pulling virtually everyone out of Iraq by the end of next March.
   ""The war in Iraq, which President Bush misled us into, has been a disaster and more and more Americans understand that,"" Sanders said. ""The amendment I voted for would allow for a responsible, phased redeployment that will remove our service members from the crossfire of an escalating civil war in Iraq. It would also send a clear message to the Iraqi people and their government that they must begin to work through the difficult issues that will be necessary to create a stable and lasting peace. Importantly, it will also allow us to better focus our energies on combating the very serious problems of international terrorism.
   ""Our country has lost some 3,300 soldiers - while 24,000 others have been wounded. Tens of thousands more will come home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. There are estimates that as many as 500,000 Iraqis have died. Over 2 million Iraqis have fled their country and another 2 million have been displaced as a result of violence and 'ethnic cleansing.'
   ""At a time when our country has a record-breaking national debt, the war in Iraq has cost us almost $500 billion, and the final cost will almost certainly be more than $1 trillion. Meanwhile, because of our continued occupation in Iraq, demagogues like Osama bin Laden are able to rally Islamic fanatics around the world, and the number of terrorist attacks grows higher and higher. The time is overdue for a change in Iraq - for us to bring our troops home, to engage Iraq's neighbors and the international community in a diplomatic solution, and to support those elements in Iraq who want to create a stable Iraq with economic assistance.""
   Senator Leahy also cosponsored the legislation and voted for the amendment.
   Leahy said, ""The nation was misled into a war that White House incompetence has made increasingly worse for our troops, for Iraqis and for our country. Instead of making us safer, this war has diverted our attention and resources from the fight against Al Qaeda and from a lengthening list of other security and foreign policy challenges.
   The strongest legislation to date on ending the Iraq, it lost 29 to 67.

1770,"VERMONT VETERANS PROGRAM A MODEL FOR THE NATION
  An innovative Vermont outreach program for troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan is the model for a $30-million national pilot project that Senator Bernie Sanders will ask the Senate to approve when it resumes work this week on a defense authorization bill. ""My hope is that increased coordination between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs and local and state organizations will mean that veterans and their families will be better informed and more likely to get the care they deserve,"" Sanders said. 
   Sanders last year secured $1 million for the Vermont National Guard working with the White River Junction VA Medical Center to visit the homes of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The outreach workers, all veterans themselves, make certain that service members and their families know about available benefits, including mental health care and support programs under the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The outreach workers also provide referral services. 
   ""We're very appreciative of the congressional efforts to bring this ground-breaking program to Vermont,"" Adjutant General Michael Dubie said. ""The outreach program has already helped a number of returning soldiers, airman and their families and we look forward to the continuance of this worthwhile initiative in the future.""
   ""The National Guard and the White River Junction VA Medical Center continue their close working relationship to insure that Vermonters who have served in uniform and their families receive competent, coordinated and timely services they are entitled by virtue of their selfless service to our nation,"" said Gary M. DeGasta, the center director.
   Sanders later this week will offer an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would provide $30 million for a national pilot project expanding the Vermont program to other parts of the country.
   The Defense Department would be authorized to support outreach programs that support marriage counseling, services for children, suicide prevention, substance abuse awareness and treatment, mental health care, financial counseling, domestic violence awareness and prevention, and employment assistance and other services. The outreach programs also would develop strategies for families to learn how to live with a service member coping with post traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries. Sanders' legislation also would put a special emphasis on face-to-face outreach to veterans and their families who live in rural areas, one of the unique aspects of the Vermont program.
   A member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Sanders has worked in Congress to increase resources for veterans. ""If anybody thinks that we have had the resources to adequately support the veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, plus all of our older veterans, they sorely misunderstand the situation,"" Sanders said. ""I intend to do everything that I can to make sure that the Bush administration, instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, starts adequately funding the V.A. so we don't continue to have the disgraceful situation that we currently do. We need more innovative programs like this one in Vermont that bring resources together to help our veterans.
   ""If we go to war, what we have to understand is that the cost of war does not stop the day that the war ends,"" Sanders concluded. ""The cost of war stops when every service member or veteran gets all the help that they and their families deserve as a result of their service to this country.""

   Sanders said he and Kennedy were in agreement that the conditions which led to the original authorization for the Iraq war - the purported existence of weapons of mass destruction and the supposed relationship of Saddam Hussein with Al Qaeda - were no longer relevant, as no weapons were found and Saddam Hussein has been executed. ""Since the reasons we were told that we were going to war no longer apply, the Congress must fulfill its Constitutional duties, and require a vote before we expand the war into a new phase,"" Sanders said. 
   ""The great majority of the citizens of Vermont, and, in fact, the great majority of all Americans, do not want an escalation of the war. They want to provide the necessary funding to protect our troops and to bring them home as soon as possible,"" Sanders said today. ""The military leaders on the ground have not asked for additional troops, and, in my view, the President is moving in exactly the wrong direction. We should be figuring out how to bring our brave troops home not send more of them into the quagmire in Iraq.""

1922,"VETERANS TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT INCREASING
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a member of the Senate veterans committee, announced today that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs will raise travel reimbursement rates from 11 cents a mile to 28.5 cents a mile, effective tomorrow. 
   The mileage reimbursement rate has not been increased for 30 years. As a member of the veterans committee, Sanders fought for increased funding in the VA budget to make the increase possible.
   Sanders said, ""At a time when gas prices are now at $3.15 a gallon, this increase in the VA's mileage reimbursement rate is long overdue. The cost of travel should not discourage our veterans from seeking the health care benefits they have earned through their service. In rural states like Vermont, this is an especially important issue. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I will continue to push for even more improvements in veterans benefits.""
   Sanders had written VA Secretary James Peake to encourage him to take this action after the senator and others were successful in pushing to make funding available. Senator Sanders has cosponsored legislation to tie the VA's reimbursement rate to the rate at which the federal government reimburses its employees for mileage, currently 48.5 cents a mile.

1270,January 16  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Bush Announcement on Medicare Prescription Drug Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement on news reports that the Bush Administration is asking private insurers to take steps to aid Medicare beneficiaries bearing the brunt of implementation problems plaguing the Medicare prescription drug program             Yet again  the Bush Administration has responded to a crisis by doing too little too late   The Bush Administration s response to the prescription drug crisis gripping our country is like its response to Hurricane Katrina  slow  inept and dangerous   But unlike Katrina  which was an act of God  this drug plan was conceived by the Bush White House and implemented by an act of Congress  with Republicans leading the way   For too many of our most vulnerable seniors and disabled Americans  getting their medications is literally a matter of life and death   They need more than a band aid   They deserve real leadership and action toward solving these predicted problems             Senator Clinton has been a vocal advocate for the need to fix the problems plaguing the new Medicare prescription drug program and ensure that Medicare recipients receive the assistance they need and deserve   Senator Clinton has announced that she will join with Senate colleagues to introduce legislation to ensure that states are reimbursed by the federal government for taking emergency action to keep access to medications for our most vulnerable   In anticipation of these problems  Senator Clinton in December introduced legislation to help dual eligibles make a smooth transition from Medicaid prescription drug coverage to the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program  requiring outreach and education to pharmacies on dually eligible beneficiaries and waiving the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting these beneficiaries   Senator Clinton is also a co sponsor of legislation that would extend amount of time seniors have to enroll in the program           Senator Clinton also has released a resource guide to prescription drug coverage under Medicare  available in English and Spanish  to help New Yorkers navigate this transition  The guide has been distributed to more than 75 000 New Yorkers and is posted on Senator Clinton  s website at www clinton senate gov             ,0
1652,February 1  2007 Senator Clinton s Remarks to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  AIPAC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I am so honored to be here and once again to speak on behalf of the causes and concerns that we share  And there is no doubt that AIPAC is at the forefront of efforts to advocate on behalf of Israel  And on behalf of the shared interests and security and democracy that form the unbreakable bond between our two nations           I thank you for supporting AIPAC  Because as active citizens you are serving an essential function  when you advocate  when you lobby  when you speak out on issues that matter to the Jewish community and to Israel you are speaking also on behalf of issues that are important to the larger community of Americans         That s because the bond shared between the U S  and Israel is based on shared interests but is rooted in the strength we derive from our shared values  As Americans we are humbled by Israel s commitment to civic engagement and open debate  free expression and the rule of law  even in the face of grave dangers  The balance between a life lived in faith and the civic life of a democratic state producing dynamism and vigor in Israeli politics and society           And both Israelis and Americans know so well  a democracy is far more than just holding elections  Democracy has to spring from an active and open citizenry dedicated to tolerance  to respect for differences  to the rule of law  to policies that lift us up not tear us down as fellow human beings  and to the value of human life  So I thank AIPAC  I thank your national leadership  Bernice and Howard  I thank the Northeast leadership  including Yossi Siegel and Mike Sachs and so many others  and I don t have to tell you that as we gather tonight  your voice and your activism is needed desperately           This is a moment of great difficulty for Israel and great peril for Israel  for the U S  and for free and democratic nations  Israel is confronting many of the toughest challenges in her history  in a neighborhood that is less secure than ever  At this moment of peril  what is vital is that we stand by our friend and our ally and we stand by our own values      Israel is a beacon of what s right in a neighborhood overshadowed by the wrongs of radicalism  extremism  despotism and terrorism  We need only look to one of Israel s greatest threats  namely  Iran  Make no mistake  Iran poses a threat not only to Israel  but to the entire Middle East and beyond  including the U S  I don t need to remind this group that about a month ago the Iranian government hosted a conference in Tehran whose sole purpose was to deny the Holocaust           Now that conference was beyond the pale of international discourse and acceptable behavior and we must not treat this situation as business as usual  The gathering was hosted by the leader of the member of a United Nations state and by a leader that has raised serious international concerns over his country s nuclear ambitions and who has called for Israel to be wiped off the map           To deny the Holocaust places Iran s leadership in company with the most despicable bigots and historical revisionists  It is an insult  not only to a memory of the millions of Jews who suffered and died in the Shoah but also to the troops of the U S  and its allies  who in the fight to liberate Europe from Nazism bore witness to the reality of the Holocaust           Such comments add greater urgency to the necessity to doing everything we can to deny nuclear weapons to Iran   The regime s pro terrorist  anti American  anti Israeli rhetoric only underscores the urgency of our response to the threat we face           U S  policy must be clear and unequivocal  We cannot  we should not  we must not  permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons  And in dealing with this threat as I have said for a very long time  no option can be taken off the table          But Iran is a threat not only because of the hateful rhetoric spewed by its president  not only because of its nuclear ambitions  but because it uses its influence and its revenues in the region to support terrorist elements that are attacking innocent Israelis  and now we believe attacking American soldiers   Hezbollah s attacks on Israel this summer using Iranian weapons clearly demonstrate Iran s malevolent influence even beyond its borders            It is essential to those of us who care deeply about what is happening in and to  Israel  to recognize that Israel s struggle is a struggle on behalf of a future where people will be able to live with peace and security   The kidnapping of Israeli soldiers  that precipitated the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon last summer  have not yet been resolved   And it is essential that Israel s abducted soldiers are returned unconditionally   I visited with Karnit Goldwasser before coming on to the stage  I met with Karnit and other family members last summer  Karnit came to my office in the Senate  and what an extraordinary young woman she is  her resolve  her love for her husband  her belief in her country is just profound   I ve heard her pleas and the pleas of others  whose loved ones have been so cruelly taken   And I know how important it is to ensure the safe return of the captured soldiers   I ve also sent a letter to Jacob Kellenberger the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross  to do whatever he can to verify the health and well being of the three soldiers and ensure that they have their full rights under the Geneva Convention and to do what he can to secure their release            We also know that the dangers posed to Israel have been compounded by the rise to power of Hamas  an avowed terrorist group that has assumed the reigns of the government in the Palestinian Authority and Hezbollah  the terrorist group that is represented in the Lebanese government   I have long said that Hamas must not be recognized until it renounces violence and terror and recognizes Israel s right to exist   And now Hamas and Hezbollah must return Israel s abducted soldiers and to stop their terror campaign against Israelis            Hezbollah is second only to Al Qaeda to the number of American lives it has claimed   We know too of the deep and dangerous connections these terrorists share with the governments of Syria and Iran  and we are seeing the reprehensible consequences of having these terrorist beachheads along Israel s borders            Hamas terror campaigns have claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians and its leaders have refused to disarm  to reject violence  or even to recognize the right of Israel to exist   We must insist that Hamas and indeed all Palestinian parties renounce terror and recognize Israel   In 1999 I raised the problem of anti Semitism in Palestinian textbooks  now eight years later we continue to hear disturbing reports that these textbooks have not been changed and I will be doing an event in Washington in the Senate  next week  to highlight the anti Semitic  anti Israeli rhetoric that is still part of the Palestinian curriculum            I was deeply saddened and outraged by the suicide bombing in Eilat this week   Some are saying that Eilat was bombed because Israeli s efforts at self defense through its security fence have been so successful   But Eilat is a tragic reminder of the threats that Israel faces everyday and underscores the importance of our continued support for Israel s right to protect and defend her people   The highest priority of any government is to ensure the safety and security of its citizens and that is why  as I have said  I ve been a strong supporter of Israel s right to build a security barrier to keep terrorists out  I have spoken out against the International Court of Justice for questioning Israel s right to build that fence of security   On my trip to Israel a little over a year ago  I went to see the fence with my own eyes  During a trip to Gilo  a Jerusalem neighborhood  I was greeted by Col  Danny Tirza  who was overseeing the construction of the security fence           He explained how just in this one neighborhood  before the fence was constructed  residents of in Gilo would come under fire  he pointed to some homes and he said  you know  in the homes that were built here  the kitchen is in the back  facing the Palestinian territories   People would be watching television in their living room  they would come in to get a drink or something to eat in the refrigerator  they would open the refrigerator and the light of the refrigerator would draw fire from snipers who were on the other side of the border  Col  Tirza s explanation in his graphic depiction of what was part of the daily life of people living in that one neighborhood  gave me an even greater appreciation for the imperative of the fence and the need to do everything possible to protect Israel against these continuing attacks           Nowhere in the world is the responsibility that comes with freedom more on display than Israel  Israelis have long had to make sacrifices in order to achieve peace and security  Too many young soldiers have been lost protecting the lives and livelihoods of all of Israel s citizens and too many innocent civilians have been killed during those years      Now as a thriving democracy  Israel has no shortage of strong opinions  all of which get full hearing whether it s in a session of the Knesset or in a coffee shop in Tel Aviv  But Israel has also used its strengths to forge alliances throughout the world even when those efforts have not always been welcome           A perfect example of this is Magen David Adom  I ve long supported the MDA and for decades it was denied admission to the International Committee of the Red Cross despite the fact it had deployed its volunteers and resources to help victims of disaster worldwide  whether victims of the tsunami in Southeast Asia or victims of Hurricane Katrina right here in our own country  When I learned the MDA was excluded from the ICRC  I was outraged by the injustice  And despite its international  non political  life saving work  it was being singled out because it was Israeli  So I joined with many of you in the struggle to try to obtain recognition and we have been in this together for a number of years  some of you for a long  long time  I worked with you to advocate for full inclusion  I sponsored legislation placing limitations on the US contributions to the ICRC until it recognized MDA  And after years of brokering negotiations  and writing letters  and making calls  and passing legislation  after years of urging the Swiss to find a solution to enable the MDA full participation  all of our collective efforts finally paid off when  this summer  the ICRC righted this historic wrong and admitted MDA into the International Committee of the Red Cross           When I was in Israel in 2002  I met a medic named Yohai Porat who was training international volunteers in first aid  He was one of these young men who just drew you to him  He was magnetic and I could see that these volunteers from the United States  from Europe  from Latin America were in awe of him  A few days after I left  while he was on IDF duty  he was killed in a terrorist attack and I was fortunate during this last trip a year ago to meet his parents who I had called to express my condolences upon hearing of Yohai s death and I told them how inspired I had been to see him in action with these young people           His spirit of service and dedication to his country  his faith in humanity  permeates Israeli culture and is one of many reasons that I have been  I am now  and I always will be proud to stand with all of you as a strong supporter of Israel  Because we           We believe that Israelis have the right to live in their country without the constant threat of terrorism  war  and rocket fire  But as we face these difficult times  we have to constantly be asking ourselves what is the best strategy we can pursue to support Israel  to support our common values  to try to take on the challenges posed in this increasingly dangerous and unstable world  particularly in the Middle East  I believe that  as I said many times before and as I repeat tonight  that we in America  particularly our government have to be trying new tactics in this endeavor to reign in terrorism  to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear power  to quell the influence of Hezbollah and Hamas           There are no easy answers to the complex situation we face today  I have advocated engagement with our enemies and Israel s enemies because I want to understand better what we can do to defeat those who are aiming their hatred  their extremism  their weapons at us  And I believe we can gain valuable knowledge and leverage from being part of a process again that enables us to get a better idea of how to take on and defeat our adversaries           This is a worthy debate to have in our country today  There are many  including our President who rejects any kind of process of any sort of engagement with countries like Syria and Iran  I do believe that that is certainly a good faith position to take  but I am not sure it is the smartest strategy that will take us to the goals that we share           It is a debate worth having because right now we know that there are direct threats to Israel  to our young men and women in harms way in Iraq  to the very fragile democracy in Iraq and to the one in Lebanon  As bad as the situation looks to us today  it could become even worse  And what do I mean by engagement or some kind of a process  Well I m not sure anything positive would come out of it  I have no expectations whatsoever  But there are a number of factors that I think argue for some attempt to do what I am suggesting  number one I don t think we know enough about how Iranian society and their government really functions  I was struck by the rejection of the President s party in those recent elections  If we are having to pursue potential action against Iran beyond enforcing the toughest sanctions that we can and bringing the world community along as hard as it is  to recognize the danger to them as well as to us and to Israel then I want to know more about the adversary we face  I want to understand better what the leverage we can bring to bear on them will actually produce  I want to get a better sense of what the real power centers and influentials are  And I also want to send a message if we ever do have to take war  drastic action to the rest of the world  that we exhausted all possibilities because we need friends and allies to stand with us as we stand with Israel in this long war against terrorism and extremism         I talked with a number of you about how we best pursue our mutual goal of reining in terrorism and extremism of protecting and guaranteeing the security of Israel  of preventing a state that sponsors terrorism from becoming a nuclear power  There are no good analogies that we can pull from history because we re living with new threats and asymmetric warfare and state actors and non state actors  each of whom have the potential to wreak such horrible damage on innocents  but I suggest and hope you will consider thinking of a smart way to pursue our interests and Israel s at this dangerous time that gives us both more information and more leverage  Similarly with Syria which is becoming an even greater problem because of its support for Hamas  because of its involvement in both Lebanon and Iraq against Israeli and American interests  we also have to do more to figure out what  if any real leverage we can bring to bear  And all during the Cold War we met with the Soviet Union while they had thousands of missiles pointed at our cities while their leaders threatened to bury us while they sowed discord and military uprisings and actions against us and our allies  That was a smart strategy even though it was a difficult one  Today we face a new set of dangers that in some way are more difficult because we re living in not a stable  bipolar world  but living in an unstable  multi polar world  And I think you can send a very clear message to your enemies about what they will face if they do not change while trying to figure how best to create conditions internally and externally within those societies to cause that change           It is also important that we look at the support of the American people for American leadership including military leadership around the world  The problems that we face in Iraq today have certainly caused many Americans to move away from a belief that the United States has a role in promoting freedom and democracy  If we withdraw from the world  if we turn our back on the dangers we face that I believe will cause problems for us and very big problems for Israel  We need American support first and foremost for American leadership in combating the dangers of extremism and terrorism           So as I look over the horizon  I think we have undermined our leadership and our ability to maneuver successfully in this increasingly dangerous world in a time when we are needed more than ever  And we need to use every tool at our disposal including diplomatic and economic in addition to the threatened use of military force  There are no quick solutions for the difficulties we face today  but we know that we have to stand with democracies and free peoples against the threat of nihilism and extremism  That is why we stand with Israel because it is a beacon of democracy in the region  that is why we stand with Israel because its very existence is a defiant affront to anti Semitism  that is why we stand with Israel because in defeating terror because Israel s cause is our cause  And that is why we stand with Israel because of our shared values and our shared belief in the dignity of men and women and the right to live without fear or oppression   And what we must do is to think rationally and strategically about how our values  our beliefs can be translated into effective action  It is not enough for us to say the right things  we ve got to be smart and tough enough to do the right things that will protect American and Israeli interests now and forever  Thank you all very much                  Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Israel and the Middle East          ,0

636,   Legislation to Drastically Improve Security at Chemical Plants   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Legislation to Drastically Improve Security at Chemical Plants Thursday  March 30  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Durbin Contact  Sandra Abrevaya   202  224 7115    Date  March 30  2006  Illinois and New Jersey Senators Introduce Legislation to Drastically Improve Security at Chemical Plants Two Plants in Chicago Area Could Threaten More than 1 million People   CHICAGO   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Durbin  D IL   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  and Bob Menendez  D NJ  today introduced legislation to drastically improve security at our nation s chemical plants     There may be no greater failure of our government than the fact that we have done almost nothing to secure one of America s most vulnerable targets   the 15 000 chemical plants in America   said Obama   These chemical plants represent some of the most attractive targets for terrorists looking to cause widespread death and destruction  Despite this  security at our chemical plants is voluntary   left to the individual plant owners  While many chemical plant owners have taken steps to beef up security  too many have not  In Illinois  there have been recent reports by ABC 7 in Chicago of chemical plants with dilapidated fences  insufficient guard forces  and unprotected tanks of hazardous chemicals  These plants are basically stationary weapons of mass destruction  Their security is light  their facilities are easily entered  and their contents are deadly      Chemical plant security is a serious problem and the combination of lax security and deadly chemicals is a toxic mix   said Durbin    Illinois has more facilities that store extremely hazardous materials then any other state  with over 100 000 pounds of hazardous substances stored in over 600 facilities   It is unacceptable that we have chemical plant facilities in our state and in other parts of this country that anyone can stroll onto   This bill puts a lock on the door and real fencing in the yard     There are 111 facilities in the United States where a worst case scenario attack on a chemical plant could threaten more than one million people  according to the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Two of these facilities are within Chicago s city limits  Illinois has at least 11 facilities where a large scale chemical release could threaten more than a million people    The Chemical Safety and Security Act of 2006 would replace current weak voluntary chemical plant security standards with a clear set of federal regulations that all plants must abide by  Plants that are considered a high risk to large population areas or critical infrastructure would face more stringent standards    Plant owners and employees would work together to tailor their security plans to address each individual facility s vulnerabilities  but they would face tough penalties for noncompliance  The bill would also protect the right of states to establish security standards that fit local needs so that states like New Jersey that have been leaders in chemical security do not see their current laws weakened    The bill addresses all methods to reduce risk  including physical security such as security forces  perimeter defenses  hazard mitigation and emergency response  But the bill also requires the use of safer technologies to reduce the attractiveness of chemical plants as a target  This concept  known as Inherently Safer Technology  involves methods such as changing the flow of chemical processes to avoid dangerous chemical byproducts  reducing the pressures or temperatures of chemical reactions to minimize the risk of explosions  reducing inventories of dangerous chemicals and replacing dangerous chemicals with benign ones  Each one of these methods reduces the danger that chemical plants pose to our communities and makes them less appealing targets for terrorists     Safety regulations can be implemented in a way that is flexible enough for the industry yet stringent enough to protect the American people   Senator Obama said   It is long past time to put the security of our nation ahead of special interests or politics   Now is the time to act to protect our citizens      This is a comprehensive bill that will satisfy the need for tighter security at chemical plants with a minimum of disruption for chemical manufacturers   said Durbin    It not only increases onsite security  it calls for stricter rules on chemical production and protects employees who expose security risks   We need tough  enforceable standards for chemical plant security and this bill will move us much closer to that goal     Lautenberg Obama  The Chemical Security and Safety Act  Establishes General Duty to Improve Security at Facilities Storing Threshold Amounts of Chemicals  Requires chemical facilities to take steps to improve security  including improving barriers  containment and mitigation  safety training  and  where possible  use safer technology   Known as  Inherently Safer Technology   or IST  includes using less toxic chemicals and employing safer procedures   Identifies High Priority Chemical Facilities  Directs the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to work with the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   as well as state and local agencies  to identify  high priority  chemical facilities that would receive priority oversight   Prioritization would be based on the threat posed to public health and safety due to proximity to population centers  type and amount of chemicals involved  and threats to national security and critical infrastructure    Requires High Priority Facilities to Conduct Vulnerability Assessments and Develop and Implement Response Plans  Directs DHS to work with EPA  as well as with state and local agencies  to establish regulations to require each high priority facility to do the following   Conduct a vulnerability hazard assessment  Develop a prevention  preparedness and response plan that incorporates the assessment results  and includes actions to reduce vulnerabilities by improving security measures and  where possible  uses safer technology   In developing the plans  facility operators must consult with facility employees and local first responders  Participate in periodic scheduled and unscheduled site visits and inspections to assure compliance with security plans and other requirements  Establish safety and security advisory committees at each facility that includes employees and managers  Conduct drills to practice prevention  preparedness and response plans   Provide employees with security training every year   The bill would establish an information clearinghouse to disseminate best practices for risk assessment  security planning  and the use of Inherently Safer Technology   Protects State Laws  Protects state and local government s right to establish chemical security and safety requirements more stringent than national standards   Protects Whistleblowers  Protects employees who report dangerous gaps in security to the Department of Homeland Security   Protects Sensitive Information  Protects security information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and other state or local disclosure laws    Inherently Safer Technology  IST   Widely Accepted   The concept of Inherently Safer Technology  IST  was developed in 1977 by chemical industry insiders who were seeking innovative ways to reduce risk     The Department of Homeland Security s July 2004 draft Chemical Sector Specific Plan states that inherently safer chemistry and engineering practices can prevent or delay a terrorist incident  noting that it is important to make sure that facility owners and operators consider alternate ways to reduce risk  such as inherently safer design  implementing just in time manufacturing  or replacing high risk chemicals with safer alternatives    The Department of Justice recognized the value of IST in introducing a methodology to assess chemical facilities  vulnerabilities in 2002    New Jersey requires chemical facilities to review the practicability of adopting inherently safer technology in its 2005 chemical security law    Industry uses IST in its volunteer security standards   The American Chemistry Council s  Responsible Care R  Security Code of Management Practices  requires that chemical sources take  into account inherently safer approaches to process design  in implementing security measures   Options to Reduce Risk  Alternative reaction routes or plant layout  the sequence of reactions in the process may reduce or eliminate a hazardous exposure   For example  in producing the insecticide Carbaryl  one can change the sequence of steps in the reactions process so that the potentially dangerous methyl isocyanate is eliminated as an intermediate product   Simplification  eliminate unnecessary complexity so workers can comprehend the process and recognize hazardous circumstances   Energy limitation  the energy potential   whether electrical  chemical or kinetic   is reduced in order to reduce the hazard of an exposure   For example  reducing temperature or pressure in reactions can reduce potentials for explosions   Substitution  safer materials or processes are substituted for more hazardous substances or processes   For example  substituting an inherently toxic substance for one that is biologically benign   Intensification or minimization  avoid the catastrophic potential of an exposure by storing small amounts of a substance   For example  storing less volume of flammable chemicals   Economically Viable   A recent study by an MIT Professor published in the journal Safety Science identified more than two dozen feasible inherent safety alternatives   The majority of those options were shown to have payback times of less than two years  Overall  25 percent of the options were implemented during the study   Examples from across the Country  In Washington  DC  the Blue Plains Sewage Plant switched from volatile chlorine gas to less volatile sodium hypochlorite bleach  which has far less potential for airborne off site impact   In Cheshire  Ohio  American Electric Power selected a urea based pollution control system rather than one involving large scale storage of ammonia that would have endangered the surrounding community   In Cuyahoga County  Ohio  ALCOA reduced its potential off site impact by working with local emergency planners and ending on site storage of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid   There are 148 gasoline refineries in the country   Fifty of them use hydrogen fluoride to increase the octane  Hydrogen fluoride is highly toxic  If released into the air  the liquid turns into a heavy  low lying gas  In the last ten years  many refineries have switched to safer alternatives like sulfuric acid or modified hydrogen fluoride that does not turn into a gas   Shifting Risk Rather than Eliminating Risk   There are few examples where shifting technologies appears safer  but actually increases risk  For example  at times  the only viable replacement for a toxic chemical is one that is more flammable or that risks public health   These examples are a minority and can be managed when IST is reviewed on a facility by facility basis and balanced against increases in overall threat                                     ,1

1048,October 13  2006 Senator Clinton Calls for Action to Help Students at Lower Manhattan Schools Following 9 11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Illnesses and Problems Experienced by Recent Graduates of Stuyvesant High School Only Add to Concerns About Contaminants and Air Pollution Released During the World Trade Center Collapse   Senator Renews Call for EPA to Test and Clean Up Buildings Including Residences  Offices and Schools that were Affected by WTC Dust                                                                        New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to conduct a new testing and clean up program in New York to make sure that apartments  businesses and schools are not contaminated with dangerous toxic materials from the World Trade Center  Recent reports of illnesses affecting Stuyvesant High School students have added to concerns about the debris and toxins that were spread across parts of the city following the collapse of the World Trade Center towers          Senator Clinton  who has been pushing the EPA to test and clean apartments  workplaces and other buildings following the attacks  and has fought to secure vital funding for workers  residents and first responders who are now sick and dying  has written to the EPA  asking them again to commit to a comprehensive testing and clean up program that can identify and eliminate any remaining contamination and can assure New Yorkers that their schools  offices and homes are safe          In a letter to EPA Regional Administrator Alan J  Steinberg  Senator Clinton noted that   Recent graduates of Stuyvesant High School  which is located near the World Trade Center  have come forward to talk about their health and the conditions in their school after September 11   One student noted that the building smelled of smoke for months  another complained of increased asthma attacks  and one student has tragically contracted Hodgkins disease               This is an issue that should have been addressed long ago   The collapse of the World Trade Center propelled debris and toxins across lower Manhattan and as far away as Brooklyn   In many nearby buildings  windows were blown out  and layers of dust accumulated in interior spaces   In other buildings  dust entered through open windows or through ventilation systems     the Senator s letter continued            The recent reports about Stuyvesant High School underscore the fact that the threat of indoor contamination is still a pressing problem  The EPA should reverse course and commit to a comprehensive testing and cleanup program that can identify and eliminate any remaining contamination  and can assure New Yorkers that their schools  offices and homes are safe     the Senator s letter concluded          Shortly after September 11  Senator Clinton and her colleague Congressman Jerrold Nadler pushed the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to begin an indoor cleanup program in New York   In August of 2003  the EPA Inspector General  IG  issued a report identifying major flaws in the EPA indoor cleanup program  including its failure to include areas north of Canal Street or in Brooklyn   Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler pressed the Administration to respond to the IG  s report  resulting in the formation of the EPA World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel  WTC Panel    The WTC panel considered input from its own experts  as well as community and labor representatives  and advised EPA about how a new cleanup program should be designed  On November 29th last year  the EPA   ignoring input from its own panel members  residents  workers and the community   announced their plan to retest and clean indoor air spaces following the collapse of the World Trade Center  Fundamentally  the plan failed to correct the major problems identified by EPA s Inspector General in 2003          In December last year  Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler responded by calling for the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to undertake an investigation into the EPA s failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan for testing and cleaning indoor air contamination following the September 11th attacks  In addition to the GAO report  Clinton and Nadler also called on the EPA to put forward a revised plan that would include residential  commercial  and work places in expanded geographic areas that were not included in the EPA s final plan            The illnesses of former Stuyvesant High School students raise new questions about the toxic legacy of September 11   The federal government must take care of those residents  workers  students and first responders who are ill   It is long past time for EPA to implement a comprehensive testing and clean up program to assure New Yorkers that their schools  offices and homes are safe     Senator Clinton said  following the release of the letter          Senator Clinton has fought hard over the past five years to secure funding and support for those brave men and women who selflessly responded in the days  weeks and months after 9 11 and for the residents and office workers who were affected   She lead efforts to secure  12 million in December of 2001 to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program at Mt  Sinai  the first program designed to track and monitor the health of 9 11 responders   When it was clear this money was not nearly enough to meet the need  she worked with her colleagues to get an additional  90 million to expand the number of workers and volunteers eligible   When the Administration then took back an additional  125 million in aid  she fought successfully to restore it and redirect funds for treatment   marking the first time any federal aid has been allocated for treatment services for our heroes          Senator Clinton has authored the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006  which would authorize  1 9 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment grants to firefighters  first responders  police officers  workers  volunteers  residents  and others whose health was directly impacted at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills that will be available from 2007 2011   She also is the lead sponsor in the Senate of bills introduced by both Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and Congressman Jerrold Nadler to address these issues          Senator Clinton also joined with Senator George V  Voinovich  R OH  to sponsor a successful amendment to the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act which will facilitate health monitoring of individuals exposed to harmful substances as a result of future terrorist attacks or natural disasters          As part of her efforts  Senator Clinton also recently joined with Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Charles Schumer  D NY  to introduce The James Zadroga Act of 2006 to amend the eligibility rules of the 9 11 Victims Compensation Fund  extending the filing deadline beyond the original December 2003 limit so that victims and first responders who became ill    in addition to their respective family members    can still be compensated  The bill will also allow for adjustment of previous awards and allow eligibility to responders and families of responders who arrived to Ground Zero after the first 96 hours          ,0

1940,"BIG OIL PROFITEERS
  Rising fuel prices pushed profits for Exxon Mobil and other petroleum producers to new records. ""It is absurd,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said, ""for oil companies like Exxon Mobil to be raking in obscene profits while millions of Americans are struggling to pay skyrocketing gas and home heating oil prices. We owe it to the American people to do everything we can to stop big oil companies from ripping off American consumers."" 
   ""Since 2001,"" Sanders added, ""Big Oil has earned more than half-a-trillion dollars in profits, but devoted less than a penny per gallon to produce clean and affordable renewable fuels in this country to reduce Americans' dependency on oil. Instead, the president and his allies in Congress blocked efforts to repeal oil company tax breaks and devote those resources to incentives for the production of energy efficient vehicles and renewable energy,"" Sanders added.
   Congress should renew those efforts this year, he added, and also take these steps to rein in prices for petroleum products:
   * Impose a windfall profits tax on the oil companies. Revenue from a windfall profits tax could make a substantial down payment on meeting the urgent need to repair crumbling roads, bridges, and highways.
   * Urge the president to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization against OPEC for illegally colluding to raise oil prices. ""It's time the wealthy OPEC cartel obeyed international law and stop manipulating the price of oil,"" Sanders said.
   * Place a moratorium on big oil company mergers and give serious consideration to breaking up some of the biggest oil companies in this country, including Exxon Mobil, Conoco-Phillips and Chevron-Texaco.

289,   Obama  Senators Urge Special Review Board for Discharged Military Personnel  Moratorium on Personality Disorder Discharges   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama  Senators Urge Special Review Board for Discharged Military Personnel  Moratorium on Personality Disorder Discharges Friday  December 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact Shana Marchio  Bond   Michael Ortiz  Obama  Nathan Britton Boxer   or Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   Bond  Boxer  Obama  McCaskill Demand Fair Treatment of Combat Vets WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Kit Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Claire McCaskill  D MO  are urging President Bush to create a Special Review Board for discharged troops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and to place a moratorium on the military   s use of Personality Disorder Discharges     With thousands of American service members suffering every day from the less visible wounds of war  reports that the Pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service members with personality disorders are deeply disturbing     said Senator Obama      These heroes make incredible sacrifices for our country  and our brave men and women shouldn t have to fight a second war at home to get the benefits and care they deserve  The President should halt this practice until the military can review its policies and establish a special review board to examine the cases in question        Our government has a lifelong responsibility to care for the brave volunteers who have served our nation honorably in combat  unfortunately  the government is failing some of our wounded warriors     said Bond      It is critical that the government starts treating all of our troops    battle wounds     physical and mental  visible and invisible        It belittles the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform when you punish   instead of treat   those with combat injuries     said Boxer     When our brave service members are injured in combat  we cannot deny them benefits  blame their conditions on a pre existing disorder  or refuse them the care and support they deserve        The horrors of war are bad enough without a service member coming home only to have to fight against the government they fought to protect     McCaskill said     I   m please to be fighting side by side with Senator Bond in requesting a review board to study personality disorder discharges  so that those men and women who bravely fought for us and returned home with the mental scars from war get a fighting chance to receive the benefits they so greatly deserve     This bipartisan group of Senators has been examining mental health care for service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and leading the effort to end the military   s inappropriate use of personality disorder discharges  Much like the program created by President Carter to examine the records of Vietnam veterans discharged less than honorably  the Senators are urging the President to create a Special Discharge Review Program to look at administrative discharges for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  If established  the Board would give service members who served honorably in combat but subsequently received a discharge that does not entitle them to benefits the opportunity to have their cases reviewed   This is particularly important for those who failed to receive an appropriate diagnosis of or treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  or Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   The Senators believe such a process will help reduce the stigma associated with such discharges and allow those who served our nation honorably to resume normal lives after their service      The discharge review board will also look at cases where service members were diagnosed for personality disorders  In the past six years  more than 22 500 service men and women have been discharged with a    pre existing    personality disorder   The Senators have expressed concern that some of these discharges appear to be the result of misdiagnoses and are being used to force out troops who may instead be suffering from service connected psychological injuries     like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury  The use of a personality discharge can result in a loss of disability benefits and medical care from the VA  and can even lead to service members having to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses  The Senators continue to urge for the adoption of short term  commonsense safeguards to protect service members  The Senators emphasize that just limiting the use of this discharge is not enough  A moratorium  which would temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat  is necessary until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and additional safeguard to prevent misdiagnosis                    Bond  Boxer  Obama and McCaskill were joined by a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues including  Joseph Biden  D

                     Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  25 million in the FY06 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for projects to benefit the Southern Tier  including  1 million for the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center at Binghamton University   17 million for Schweizer Aircraft  s RQ 8B Fire Scout VTUAV   3 million for Rockwell Collins   GATM for the KC 135 project and Soldier Mobility and Rifle Targeting System  SMaRTS  projects   3 million for the Gunner Crew Chief Station Trainer at L 3 Communications  and  1 million for Lockheed Martin Owego  s Communication High Accuracy Locations Systems  CHALS   The bill also includes  935 9 million which was included in the President  s Budget for Lockheed Martin Owego  s VXX Marine One Program   The House has approved the bill   The Senate is expected to work on the Defense Appropriations bill this week   If the bill is passed  it will be sent to the President for his signature          This is great news for the Southern Tier   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Southern Tier and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Southern Tier defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge              New York  s Southern Tier has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support               1 million in federal funds will go to Binghamton University for the expansion of the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center  Over time  federal funding will allow the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center to become an engine for economic growth and innovation in the Southern Tier by spurring the creation of high tech regional companies to partner with the center and by driving the creation of a significant number of new jobs            The funding will also create new opportunities to improve and enhance national security  In the past there has been considerable interest in emerging technologies such as micro electromechanical systems and nanostructured materials and interconnects  however  the emphasis has been focused mainly on devices and components rather than systems  The Small Scale Systems Packaging Center meets the critical packaging challenges in the development of small scale systems and as a result  creates new opportunities for national security  The work done at the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center is focused on developing new lightweight electronics and materials for aviation systems  military clothing capable of sensing a soldier  s health and environmental and future unmanned systems  and sensor systems integration for use in harsh environments  In FY 05  the Small Scale Systems Packaging Center received  1 million  The Senators continued support of this facility in FY 06 is critical for the New York economy            3 million of the federal funding will also go to L 3 Communications for the Gunner Crew Chief Station  The money will be used to develop a Helicopter Door Gunner and Crew Chief Trainer allowing for the training of crewmembers in operating weapons systems on helicopters  The project responds to an urgent request established by Commanding General  101st Airborne Air Assault Division in preparation for deployment of air assault forces to Iraq  The funding will allow for better technology and better training for soldiers in combat            17 million in federal funds will go to Schweizer Aircraft to help support the development of the Fire Scout RQ 8 Vertical Takeoff and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  VTUAV  to be used by the US Navy and Marine Corps  The Fire Scout VTUAV is in the final stages of development  Its primary role will be to provide Navy and Marine personnel with information about combat situations and precision targeting on the sea and ashore  The Fire Scout s long endurance  excellent performance  sophisticated payloads  ability to take off and land vertically  and autonomous operating capability make it uniquely able to provide long range surveillance and targeting under the most demanding of tactical conditions            The Fire Scout s dynamic system is derived Schweizer s Model 333 turbine helicopter  which has been proven by over 20 million flight hours  With vehicle endurance greater than six hours  Fire Scout is capable of extended continuous operations  The Fire Scout will be able to fly 110 nautical miles from launch site  stay aloft for three hours  and then return   Over 5700 sailplanes  helicopters  agricultural aircraft  and reconnaissance aircraft  designed and manufactured by Schweizer Aircraft  are operated in more than 70 countries around the world             2 million of federal funds will go to Rockwell Collins   GATM for the KC 135 development  The Air Force has embarked on a program referred to as Global Air Traffic Management  GATM  to equip its applicable aircraft with a capability to comply with the new mandated FAA regulations  Aircraft that do not possess these new capabilities will be denied access to airspace where such capabilities are mandated  or be severely restricted in such areas  Restrictions may include outright denial of access to selected airspace  or assignment of limited and inefficient flight altitudes  or assignment of inefficient routes of flight  and extensive flight authorization delays           Rockwell Collins will work with the Air Force  s premier GATM program in equipping its existing fleet of KC 135 air refueling tankers with the capabilities required by these new regulations  Aircraft equipped with the required systems will have the operational advantage of choosing the most efficient and economical routes of flight  as well as continued access to airspace that is now regularly used in DOD world wide operations  While operational access to airspace has been important to address the  far flung  military commitments of the 1990  s  it has now reached a critical status as the government continues to fight the War on Terror  It is imperative that the United States is capable of projecting airpower to any location via the most direct route  This is fundamental to having combat crews reach the target area with the most fuel and in the least fatigued condition possible            1 million in federal funds will go to Rockwell Collins for the Soldier Mobility and Rifle Targeting System  SMaRTS    SMaRTS was developed for Special Operations Forces to improve night  limited and zero visibility operations  Current operations have determined that night vision goggles alone do not provide the soldier with the capability to operate and survive in many environmental conditions and mission scenarios  As the enemy gets smarter in defeating night vision goggles and continues to gain this capability themselves US soldiers are finding their technological advantage deteriorating  SMaRTS provides soldiers with a lightweight  low power  helmet mounted thermal and visible sensor with a helmet mounted display and thermal weapon sight  The system is powered by a man portable battery pack  SMaRTS is applicable to the US Army Land Warrior and is also considered an emerging capability with an associated formal requirement from the Counter Terrorism Technology Task Force and is a baseline technology for the Urban Cave Assault Advance Concept Technology Demonstration which is a Special Operations Sponsored Program            1 million in federal funds will also go to Lockheed Martin Owego for Communication High Accuracy Locations Systems  CHALS    The Communication High Accuracy Locations Systems  CHALS  provides precision location of communication signals for tactical use   The next generation CHALS system   CHALS XC provides significant improvements by expanding the frequency domain and the signal types currently supported by the legacy CHALS systems   This expanded capability would be beneficial to operational units in the war on terrorism by assisting in the precision location of enemy and terrorist cells  Additional funding will provide the benefits of the improved CHALS XC into current tactical  anti terror and homeland security operations            935 9 million in federal funds  requested in the President  s budget  will go to the Lockheed Martin led Team  s US101 project  to provide the next generation VH 71 presidential helicopter to the White House as a safe and secure  Oval Office in the Sky  for America s Commander in Chief  The US101    the name given to the American variant of the highly successful EH101 medium lift helicopter    was designed as a highly agile and maneuverable military aircraft  Three engines ensure maximum safety  payload and range at altitudes up to 15 000 feet  The US101 will have such reserves of power and built in capacity to accommodate additional mission technologies and payload

1892,"WEEK IN REVIEW, SEPT. 28
  It was a busy week. A higher education bill that adds $61 million in grants and loans for Vermont students was signed into law. The Senate gave final congressional approval to a health insurance bill for 10 million children that, unless it is vetoed, will expand Vermont's popular Dr. Dynasaur program. Senator Bernie Sanders chaired a hearing on ""green jobs"" that looked at the economic pluses of reversing global warming. Also, the Senate agreed to legislation Sanders cosponsored to probe contract abuses in Iraq. 
   Higher Ed The largest increase in student aid since passage of the GI Bill after World War II was signed into law. President Bush had threatened a veto, but thought better of it after the measure wracked up big majorities in the Senate and House. The legislation provides $17 billion in additional college aid, including $34.2 million over the next five years in new Pell grants for students attending colleges and universities in Vermont. Another $26.7 million is allotted for increased loans to Vermont students. Sanders, a member of the Senate education committee, played a major role in pushing for larger Pell grants and for the creation of a loan forgiveness program that also is included in the bill. Loans would be cancelled for college graduates who stay in public service jobs - including nursing, education, and law enforcement - for a decade. To read Senator Sander's interview in the St. Michael's College Defender, visit: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=284558
   Health Insurance The Senate gave final approval on Thursday to a health insurance bill for 10 million children. In Vermont, it would save health insurance for more than 2,000 children who would lose coverage under new rules announced by the Bush administration. The measure is headed to President Bush, who has said he will veto it. ""It is hard for me to begin to understand how this president can be threatening to veto,"" Sanders said. ""We hear a lot about family values. Well, if taking care of our children is not a family value then I don't know what is."" You can help. You can sign the online petition and tell the president to sign the bill. To watch Senator Sanders discuss the importance of the Children's Health Insurance Program on the Senate floor, visit: http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=284403
   War Contracts Commission The Senate approved legislation cosponsored by Sanders that would establish an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate U.S. wartime contracting abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""The evidence is clear that taxpayers are being ripped off for billions of dollars in no-bid contracts,"" Sanders said. Added to a Department of Defense policy bill, the amendment creating a Commission on Wartime Contracting would address rampant corruption and other problems with private companies operating in Iraq. The measure also would expand the authority of a special inspector general to monitor all wartime contracts in Afghanistan as well as Iraq. In Iraq alone, the special inspector general discovered that $9 billion in reconstruction funds simply had vanished. The legislation to create the commission was inspired by the World War II-era work of the ""Truman Committee."" Named for then-Senator Harry S Truman, the committee conducted hundreds of hearings and investigations into government waste and is credited with saving taxpayers more than $15 billion in 1943 dollars.

   Green Jobs The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing on ""green jobs."" One of the witnesses was David Blittersdorf, founder of NRG Systems, a Hinesburg, Vt.-based manufacturer of wind energy measurements systems. His newest venture, Earth Turbines, hopes to bring small wind energy technology to homes across the country. ""NRG and Earth Turbines represent only a piece of the growing wind industry, which is becoming a larger source of domestic energy production while producing hundreds of thousands of new jobs,"" he testified.

                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton hailed the unanimous Senate passage of a resolution she co sponsored to press for the deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur   Senator Clinton also submitted a statement to the Congressional Record underscoring the need for stronger Presidential leadership to address this crisis             The continued violence in Darfur  eastern Chad  and the Central African Republic threatens the lives of millions of civilians and it threatens regional security  The deployment of a robust U N  peacekeeping mission is essential  but a handful of leaders in Khartoum continue to stand in the way   I will continue to press the Bush Administration to take an active role in putting pressure on the leaders in Khartoum   said Senator Clinton          The resolution approved by the Senate underscores that the Government of Sudan has failed its responsibility to protect many peoples of Darfur    It emphasizes that U N  peacekeepers should be urgently deployed to Darfur in accordance with U N  Security Council Resolution 1706    It makes clear that the Presidential Envoy for Sudan has issued a December 31  2006 deadline for Sudan to cooperate with U N  deployment to Darfur  or face serious consequences    The resolution states that strong sanctions should be imposed against those who commit crimes against humanity in Darfur and against the Government of Sudan if it continues to obstruct deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur  the African Union mission in Sudan should be strengthened  and the violence in eastern Chad in the Central African Republic threatens regional security and should be urgently addressed            Senator Clinton has repeatedly called for action to address the crisis in Darfur  Senator Clinton authored legislation that has been enacted into law requiring the President to report regularly on Darfur   Senator Clinton also joined with Senate colleagues to secure additional assistance to the African Union Mission in Sudan   Senator Clinton also has called on the Arab League and African leaders  to increase engagement on Darfur          Click here for additional information on

robust response  In July 2004  more than two years ago  the United States Senate declared genocide in Darfur  As the crisis has continued  as the death toll has mounted  it was hard to believe that the situation on the ground could deteriorate further  Unfortunately  it has  and the realities today are even worse than they were in July 2004          As many as four million civilians have been uprooted from their homes  and by some accounts 400 000 people have been killed  Countless women and young girls are being violently and sexually abused  Escalating violence is forcing the evacuation of many vital relief workers  These realities are well documented  We have U N  reports  State Department reports  reports from our colleagues who have traveled to the region  and countless other reports that tell us what has happened  what is happening  and who may be responsible          In the face of this crisis  the response of many citizens  officials  relief workers  and journalists has been impressive and inspiring  Their courageous efforts are testimony to the great work that can be done by individuals who act on their moral duty to end atrocities          The Senate also has taken important steps  We have provided funding to African Union peacekeepers and to humanitarian workers  we have urged NATO assistance  we have encouraged the establishment of a no fly zone  we have supported sanctions against the perpetrators of violence  we have established Presidential accountability by requiring regular reports on Darfur  and we have demanded the appointment of a Presidential Envoy to Sudan  We must continue to shine a spotlight and to take action wherever possible          But  like many of my constituents  I am disturbed that the killings and rapes and violence continue  I fear that our efforts and those of many Americans are not being complemented by equal efforts from our President  I again urge the Administration to be more proactive  and to turn the tables on Khartoum           Khartoum repeatedly has committed to disarm the Janjaweed  In fact  the Government of Sudan committed to do so long ago  in the summer of 2004  To date  this promise remains unfulfilled  And this Spring  Sudanese officials said that U N  peacekeepers would be allowed into Darfur once a peace deal was agreed  This commitment has been broken also  These abandoned promises may not be surprising in light of Khartoum  s long history of intransigence  What  s astonishing is that Khartoum has faced few consequences for these massive failures  and worse  that Khartoum still is being allowed to dictate the terms of peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in Darfur          I implore the Administration to learn from this grim history  and to get one step ahead of the leaders in Khartoum  We must prepare for all scenarios  not just those we seek          Going forward  our agreements with Khartoum must include some   teeth    to incentivize compliance  We should remind Khartoum that we already have good records of the crimes committed in Darfur and of the suspected perpetrators  We also should pursue without delay all points of pressure that have been authorized by the U N  Security Council  We must demonstrate to Khartoum that continued intransigence will be more painful than cooperation          As we pursue these measures with Khartoum  we should remind rebel groups that they will be held accountable for violations of international law  In addition  we should work urgently with partners to stabilize eastern Chad and the Central African Republic          I suspect that history will pass exacting judgment on all parties who have acted insufficiently to end the suffering in Darfur  But history is a long way off for the people of Darfur  and I will continue to work urgently with colleagues towards peace in Sudan and the region  I urge the President to work more proactively to end this unconscionable crisis          ,0

                                             Obama and Honda Introduce STEM Act to Improve Science and Technology Education in Our Nation s Schools Wednesday  May 21  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Jos   Dante Parra  Honda  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Bill will strengthen federal agency education programs in the STEM fields WASHINGTON  D C    Rep  Mike Honda and Sen  Barack Obama today introduced a bipartisan bill in their respective chambers that will make America s students and future labor force more competitive in science related fields  The bill was introduced at a time when other countries are gaining ground on America in science and technology fields  Obama  D IL  and Honda  D CA  said this bill will help develop a coordinated strategy in the teaching of science  technology  engineering and math education  the fields collectively known as STEM  The  Enhancing Science  Technology  Engineering and Mathematics Education Act of 2008   H R  6104  will create mechanisms for federal agencies and the states to coordinate STEM education strategies   We need to focus our efforts in teaching the scientists and engineers of tomorrow   said Honda  a former science teacher and educator of more than 30 years   Federal agencies unfortunately are not communicating among themselves  Current federal efforts in STEM education are neither coordinated  nor coherent  nor cooperative  This bill will create the mechanisms and venue for cooperative relationships to develop    We must ensure our nation remains a global leader in scientific advancement and technological innovation  and that begins with strengthening America s schools   said Obama    Our students deserve the education and skills they need to compete in today s global economy and to understand the increasingly complex issues that face our democracy  and we must do everything we can to provide them with the resources and curriculum they need to succeed   This critical legislation will help students develop critical thinking and effective problem solving skills in science  technology  engineering and mathematics by coordinating federal STEM education efforts  consolidating federal education initiatives  and supporting states in collaboratively organizing their efforts   I am proud to introduce this legislation with Congressman Honda  and look forward to moving it forward in Congress    Among the bill s original co sponsors are Rep  George Miller  chairman of the House Committee on Labor and Education  Rep  Vernon Ehlers  R MI   and Rep  Rush Holt  D NJ    In 2006  the federal government sponsored 105 STEM education programs through 15 different federal agencies at a cost of  3 12 billion  Yet the following year  American students did poorly in a test offered world wide that measures student proficiency in understanding and applying science  Microsoft s Bill Gates summarized the concerns when he said   When I compare our high schools with what I see when I m traveling abroad  I m terrified for our workforce of tomorrow   Honda s and Obama s bill would   Reorganize the President s Office of Science and Technology Policy  OSTP   OSTP has a STEM subcommittee that has remained largely dormant over the past few years  The bill would raise that subcommittee to a committee level  giving it a mandate to work proactively at designing coherent STEM strategies  Create an Office of STEM at the U S  Department of Education at the assistant secretary level  This office will coordinate STEM education initiatives among all federal agencies and have a seat at the OSTP STEM Committee  Institute a voluntary Consortium on STEM education  The Consortium would be integrated by no less than five states representing at least five of the nation s nine geographical regions  Its mission is to develop common content standards for K 12 STEM education  engineered at the state and local levels  Create the National STEM Education Research Repository  This would be a clearing house for educators to research the latest innovations in STEM  This will break the silos that keep creative programs from being replicated    Our nation s competitiveness in the global economy depends largely on our ability to graduate students who excel in the fields of science  technology  engineering and math   Ehlers said   We must do all that we can as a nation to prepare students at every grade level so that they have a genuine interest and demonstrated skills in these fields  The jobs of tomorrow will require STEM education skills and our next generation of innovators will need them to succeed   For educators  this bill promises to create tools and make available resources that are now scattered and isolated among federal agencies and the states   The Enhancing Science  Technology  Engineering  and Math Education Act of 2008 will coordinate and enhance STEM education programs at the federal level and empower states to better address the critical needs in their STEM education systems   said Gerald Wheeler  Executive Director of the National Science Teachers Association   We are pleased to support this legislation    As the American economy attempts to recover from a deep economic downturn  losing sight of long term strategies to manage the economy can be risky  said Rep  Rush Holt    Scientists and educators should not be the only ones concerned about STEM education  Those who care about our long term economic health and the ability of future generations to compete in a new global economy should be concerned   Holt said   This legislation is part of our strategy to get STEM education back on track at a time when we can no longer afford to lose ground to our competitors                                 Pursuant to

882,July 12  2006 Schumer  Clinton Call on USDA to Provide for Disaster Assistance for Flood Affected Farmers

                 Washington  DC   Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today called upon the Secretary of Agriculture to release funds for critical programs that will provide much needed relief for New York farmers hard hit by recent flooding   The United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency recently released agricultural damage estimates that show over 200 000 acres were affected and over  30 8 million were lost in damage to farmland  buildings and crops          In a letter to USDA Secretary Johanns  the Senators called on the USDA to make adequate funding available for the existing programs that are critical for helping farmers and communities recover from this devastating event  including the Emergency Watershed Protection Program  the Emergency Conservation Program and the Crop Disaster Program   The Senators also called for consideration of a crop indemnity program similar to the one provided for farmers who suffered losses during Hurricane Katrina              The flooding in upstate New York has hit farmers incredibly hard   They are suffering huge losses in crops  equipment and facilities   Farmers are the backbone of our upstate economy and when they are devastated the whole state feels the impact of the damage   Helping our farmers remains a top priority  as we make sure every flood victim gets aid  USDA needs to step up and ensure the federal dollars will be available for New York  s farmers     said Senator Schumer             New York farmers play a vital role in the state economy and should be provided with the programs and assistance they need to get back on their feet   Farmers across the impacted areas have suffered terrible losses and now need help to repair their buildings  clean up their farmland and attempt to salvage their farm operations     Senator Clinton said     As we reach out to help everyone who was impacted by these terrible floods  we must also provide the necessary immediate and longer term assistance to help our farmers recover from their devastating losses              Below are the estimates of acreage affected and average crop losses in some of the flood affected counties

 A copy of the Senators   letter is attached           12th July 2006      The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary  United States Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20250      Dear Secretary Johanns       We are writing to urge you to provide agriculture disaster assistance to New York farmers who have been adversely affected by flood related losses as a result of severe storm events at the end of last month          Record setting heavy rains throughout June  and the current severe flooding coupled with historic high energy prices  creates a situation that many producers will not be able to handle financially   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has declared that 19 counties in the Southern Tier  Eastern and Central New York are eligible for public disaster assistance including  Broome  Chenango  Cortland  Delaware  Fulton  Greene  Hamilton  Herkimer  Madison  Montgomery  Oneida  Otsego  Rensselaer  Schenectady  Schoharie  Sullivan  Tioga  Tompkins  and Ulster Counties   These affected areas include important agricultural regions of New York State            Preliminary reports from flooded areas indicate that New York suffered severe crop losses  farmland damage and property damage  The Farm Service Agency today released estimates of crop loss and damages that total more than 200 000 affected acres at a loss of over  30 8 million dollars   Crop replant options may be not available because of excessively wet and rubble strewn fields even after flood waters recede  and high energy prices exacerbate additional planting costs  Furthermore  in many of the flooded areas  the date that crops can be successfully replanted either has already passed  or is fast approaching           In Schoharie County alone over 35 000 acres of agricultural land have been affected with extensive physical and structural damage and crop loss  Three other counties  Chenango  Delaware and Sullivan  have estimated losses on more than 20 000 acres each   Additional losses will be incurred due to loss of milk production and future crop loss   Most counties have been estimating average crop losses ranging between 25 50   and Tioga County is reporting total crop losses of 100  damage   Many dairy and livestock farms have struggled to harvest the first crop of hay due to extremely wet weather in June   As a result  farmers are anticipating a major shortage of forages to feed their herds over the coming months  and they will not have the financial reserves to purchase the feed required   There is little doubt that many producers will not be able to sustain their livelihoods unless decisive action is taken at the federal level to assist our farmers in recovering from their losses           We know that the issuance of a Disaster Declaration now provides farmers with the opportunity to access low interest emergency loans but we would also request that you consider a crop indemnity program similar to the one provided for farmers who suffered losses during Hurricane Katrina   Our farmers also need immediate assistance to implement a cover crop program that will provide green cover  reduce future erosion  and will provide some forage for animals in the area          In addition  we are also calling upon the USDA to make adequate funding available for the existing programs that are critical for helping farmers and communities recover from this devastating event  including the Emergency Watershed Protection Program  the Emergency Conservation Program and the Crop Disaster Program   Funds from these programs were used during previous flood events in New York State and were invaluable for the rebuilding of the farming sector at that time            Agriculture is the primary economic driver in upstate New York  especially in the region that was hard hit by the flooding   Federal government assistance to help New York farmers recover from these devastating losses is essential   Please do not hesitate to contact our offices if you need further information   We look forward to working with you on this issue in the future           Sincerely       Senator Charles E  Schumer                  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0
1471,June 18  2007 Senator Clinton  Colleagues Call For Prompt Action In Remedying Passport Delays

                  Call on Department of State to outline steps being taken to fix broken system  Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined several of her Senate colleagues in expressing concern about extensive delays in processing and delivering passports  The delays are the result of a sharp increase in demand for passports as a result of implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  Senator Clinton and her colleagues asked that the State Department immediately develop and implement a plan to eliminate the current backlog in passport applications  immediately cease to charge unwarranted expedition and delivery fees for passports  and restore normal processing times and explain how the Department intends to deal with the potentially large numbers of people applying for passports if they continue with their plans to implement WHTI at the Northern and Southern Borders  If the State Department can t handle the volume of passport applications for vacationers  I am very concerned about how they will be able to handle the additional volume if they proceed with their requirement to provide passports at the Northern Border  Senator Clinton said  In addition to significant delays  the State Department is also charging expedition and delivery fees to applicants  despite the fact that the delays were caused by the Department itself  It is entirely unfair that the State Department is requiring expedition fees to speed up delays of their own making  Families should not be faced with inexcusable delays and hefty fees as a result of the Department s own failings  Senator Clinton said   A copy of the letter sent by Senator Clinton and her colleagues follows  June 18  2007 T he Honorable Condoleezza Rice Secretary of State 2201 C Street  NW Washington  DC Dear Secretary Rice  We write to express our continuing concerns with delays in processing passport applications that are seriously complicating   and in some cases forcing the cancellation of   travel abroad  In recent weeks  significant and increasing numbers of our constituents have contacted us for help in receiving passports due to long processing delays that threaten imminent travel plans  These travelers applied for passports well in advance of their planned travel  However  due to the large volume of passport requests associated with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   they were not receiving passports sufficiently in advance of their planned departure dates to complete planning for their travels  In an unfortunate and rising number of these cases  our constituents have not received their passports in time  forcing them to cancel long held travel plans and or incur significant expenses to change their plans  It is our understanding that there are now more than 2 million passport applications pending  In fact  passport office staff were so overwhelmed that they were unable to respond to routine status requests  and asked that inquiries be e mailed with the planned departure date in the subject line  since they were only able to work on the most urgent requests   those closest to the planned departure date  This virtually ensured that many travelers will receive their passports only at the last minute  making it impossible to make informed decisions on whether to continue with a planned itinerary  and risk having to cancel if the passport does not arrive  or to postpone a planned departure  and incur steep fees for changing the itinerary   To add insult to injury  in many cases we were asked to provide constituents  credit card numbers when making inquiries on their behalf  because the Department intends to charge them for expediting passport processing and for delivering their passports via Federal Express  Neither charge would be necessary if the Department were processing the original applications in a timely manner  It seems grossly unfair to charge American taxpayers extra for remedying problems that were caused by the government itself  We are not in any way casting blame on the front line employees of your agency who process passport applications  It has been our experience that they have been working long and hard to ensure that travelers receive their passports prior to planned departures  However  it is clear that they are simply overwhelmed by the sheer volume of applications resulting from the implementation of the air travel provisions of the WHTI  It is unacceptable that American citizens were missing trips because the State Department did not fully anticipate the increase in passport applications and take appropriate action to increase processing resources  Your announcement last week that the Department would suspend until September 30 the passport requirement for air travel from Canada  Mexico  Bermuda  and the Caribbean was an important  if belated  recognition of the serious problems processing delays were causing travelers  However  people traveling to other parts of the globe are still in jeopardy of having to cancel their trips because of the backlog on processing passports  We continue to be concerned that citizens traveling to places that still require a passport will incur significant expenses to cancel trips or rearrange their plans because of delays in passport processing  In addition  we fear that the current backlog will recur after the temporary relief expires on September 30  and that there will be tremendous complications when the new WHTI land and sea requirements are implemented  Consequently  we ask that you take the following actions  1  Immediately cease to charge unwarranted fees for expediting and delivering passports whose issuance is delayed by the Department s failure to plan for the increased volume of passport applications  2  Immediately take further action to return processing time for passports to normal  pre WHTI timeframes for those traveling to countries for which passports are still required  and  3  Develop and share with the Congress a plan  including any additional statutory authority or resources you may require  to ensure that similar problems do not recur either when the WHTI air travel requirements again take effect after September 30 or when the land border and sea travel provisions of the WHTI requirements take

1740,"SEN. SANDERS PAYS TRIBUTE TO LT. DOOLEY
  The families of fallen service members from Vermont gathered this weekend at Arlington National Cemetery to console one another as they interred the remains of Lt. Mark H. Dooley. During a special ceremony at the cemetery, a flag flown over the United States Capitol was presented to Lt. Dooley's mother, Marion, by Senators Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders and Congressman Peter Welch. 
   A First Lieutenant in the Vermont Army National Guard and a platoon leader in Task Force Saber, Lt. Dooley, 27, was killed by an Improvised Explosive Device while on a routine patrol mission in 2005 in Ramadi. Lt. Dooley had completed his studies at Norwich University in December of 2001 and was conferred a degree in Political Science and History in May of 2002. Before his deployment to Iraq, he was a police officer in Wilmington and served with Company A of the 3-172nd Infantry Mountain Battalion from Jericho, Vermont.
   The families were accompanied to Arlington by the makers of Vermont Fallen, a documentary memorial to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the Iraq war. Produced by Norwich University, the film project was inspired by the fact that Vermont has experienced the greatest per capita loss of lives in the Iraq war.

                      Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  held a hearing today to examine the federal Superfund programs capacity to protect public health  including the reasons for recent slowdowns in the pace at which sites are added and cleaned up toxic waste sites under the program   Cleanups under the Superfund program have slowed from an average of 80 per year during the late 1990s to less than 40 per year over the last six years   In addition  EPA has identified more than 100 sites where human exposure to contamination is uncontrolled  including seven in New York     Senator Clinton has pressed the EPA to address and accelerate cleanup of contaminated sites across New York   As part of these efforts  she has introduced legislation to require the EPA to set tougher standards to protect the public from exposure to the carcinogenic chemical Trichloroethylene  TCE   one of the most widespread industrial water contaminants in the nation  found at many sites across New York   She also has advocated once again holding polluters accountable for cleanup by reinstating a fee on oil and chemical companies that previously provided funding for the now bankrupt Superfund Trust Fund    The following is a transcript of Senator Clintons opening remarks at todays hearing   SENATOR CLINTON   The Superfund program is such an important part of our environmental protection system in our country and I think this is a very significant opportunity to discuss what it is doing and what more it could do     Superfund has its roots in New York  stemming from the discovery in 1978 by Niagara Falls resident Lois Gibbs that her neighborhood known as Love Canal had been built on a massive chemical dump  The effects of that chemical dump had been seen but not understood for years and the impact on the people who live there was tragic  Love Canal became a national story and helped spur Congress to enact the Superfund law  which was signed by President Carter in December of 1980     The Love Canal site was finally taken off of the Superfunds national prioritys list in 2004  but 1 246 sites across the country remain on Superfund list today including 86 in New York alone  So as we approach this 30 year anniversary of Love Canal  the Superfund site remains vitally important  because it reminds of us of why we went down this path and the importance is underscored by a report issued last year by the Center for American Progress and the Center for Progressive Reform  That report profiled fifty of the most dangerous sites still on the Superfund list and scattered across ten states     We will hear more about that report later in the hearing but I want to highlight a couple of its findings  First  most of the fifty sites are located in heavily populated areas  Second  many have been on the list for decades  Third  they contain a range of highly toxic chemicals such as PCBs  creosote  lead  arsenic  mercury  and TCE     Sixty percent are located in neighborhoods where households reported median incomes in the range of  40 000  and some 26 percent were in the midst of populations comprised of 40 percent or more of racial or ethnic minorities  So  this is both an environmental health issue and an environmental justice issue  Thats why I am dismayed by the Bush Administrations handling of this program    The number of cleanups has fallen dramatically from the average of about 75 sites per year from 1993 to 2000 to an average of fewer than 40 sites per year under this administration    In Fiscal Year 2007  only 24 cleanups were completed  When weve asked the administration to explain this sharp drop in cleanups  they claim it is due to greater complexity of the sites left to be cleaned  I dont accept that point  but even if you take it at face value  it raises another important question  Why wont the administration therefore ask for more money to get the program back on track to deal with the allegedly more complex sites     When asked that question  the administration has tied itself into knots defending the absurd position that more money would not help all that much  And they have been extremely secretive about this project  keeping information from the public  and stonewalling this committee     Chairman Boxer submitted a series of questions and I am delighted that she is here because she submitted those questions to the EPA about Superfund five months ago  On Monday    two days before this oversight hearing    she received a stack of documents in response  All but three of the documents were marked privileged    That is just simply unacceptable  What does the administration have to hide  I thought we were all in this together     I hope we can get beyond this pattern today  The administration can keep repeating mission accomplished  but the Superfund program does not square up with reality     There are 11 superfund sites where human exposure to dangerous levels of toxic chemicals is not under control  There are 111 of those sites  because seven of them are in New York alone  In addition  EPA indicates that there are 160 other sites where EPA has insufficient information to determine whether human exposure to these toxic chemicals is under control     I will be pressing EPA today to explain their plans to get these sites under control and explore the reasons for the slow down in cleanups  I think its clear that this program needs additional funding  I think reinstating the polluter pays fee is a step we must take  both to provide additional funds for the cleanups and to make to make the program fairer     Ordinary taxpayers should not pay for cleanups and thats what has been happening at orphan sites for the last four years  So we have a lot of ground to cover today and I want to turn now to Ranking Member Senator Barrasso         ,0

requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive policy to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid  trade  debt relief  and coordination with the international community  businesses and NGOs  This legislation was introduced in December   Smith and Congressman Spencer Bachus  R AL  sponsored the House version of the bill  H R  1302   which passed the House last September    With billions of people living on just dollars a day around the world  global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges and tragedies the international community faces   said Senator Obama   It must be a priority of American foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food  shelter  and clean drinking water  As we strive to rebuild America s standing in the world  this important bill will demonstrate our promise and commitment to those in the developing world   Our commitment to the global economy must extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere  I commend Chairman Biden and Ranking Member Lugar for supporting this bill and moving it forward quickly    Poverty  hunger  and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century   Senator Hagel said    This legislation provides the President of the United States the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty   It is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history   This is a responsibility of all citizens of the world    Global poverty directly impacts our national security  We must rally private sector and government resources to eliminate extreme global poverty and to fight global disease   said Senator Cantwell    With more than 1 1 billion men  women and children throughout the world living on less than  1 a day  it is of the utmost importance to make sure these people get the help they need and push for sustainable economic growth  We need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries and extend our hand to people in need      Global poverty is one of the greatest moral and security challenges facing the world today  Nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than  2 a day and close to a billion live on less than  1 a day   This bill represents a major advance in our effort to address global poverty   After introducing this measure in the House for the past several years  I am pleased to see the Senate Foreign Relations Committee take significant steps toward its final passage   Congressman Smith said   For years  America has committed to improving the lives of the world s poorest people  In 2000  the U S  joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015  We are halfway towards this deadline  and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day   The Global Poverty Act   Declares it official U S  policy to promote the reduction of global poverty  the elimination of extreme global poverty  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme global poverty in half by 2015   Requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out that policy   Includes guidelines for what the strategy should include   from aid  trade  and debt relief  to working with the international community  businesses and NGOs  to ensuring environmental sustainability   Requires that the President s strategy include specific and measurable goals  efforts to be undertaken  benchmarks  and timetables     Requires the President to report back to Congress on progress made in the implementation of the global poverty strategy    The legislation is supported by a broad range of groups  including Bread for the World  the United States Conference

Christina Mulka  Durbin   In tests  60  of fake explosives went undetected through airport security at O Hare WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Richard Durbin  D IL  today called on TSA Administrator Kip Hawley to immediately improve the bomb detection capabilities at Chicago O   Hare International Airport and our nation   s other airports   According to yesterday   s USA Today  a recent report by the TSA revealed that undercover agents posing as passengers carrying materials for fake bombs were able to walk through airport security undetected at alarming rates during tests last year   Two other airports   Los Angeles International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport   joined O   Hare as the testing grounds for detection of bomb materials at passenger security checkpoints   Of the 75 passengers who carried fake explosives through screening stations at O   Hare  nearly 60  passed undetected   These test results are a frightening reality check for travelers about the screening capability of our nation   s airports    In the letter  Obama and Durbin call on Administrator Hawley to provide information as to what steps have been taken to address these recent security deficiencies  what measures have been taken to improve screener training  and how bomb detection equipment will be improved     Since our country was attacked on 9 11  strengthening security at Chicago O   Hare and other airports has been a top homeland security priority     said Senator Obama      Reports that airport security at our country   s busiest airports failed to detect fake explosives prove that TSA should immediately step up security   It   s time for the Bush Administration to guarantee the safety of travelers and the security of our country        I am disappointed in the results of the TSA report and want to see that the proper steps are being taken to correct the screening deficiencies at O   Hare     said Durbin      Passengers facing long lines at the airport should not have the stress of traveling compounded by a concern for their safety   Senator Obama and I are asking the TSA to explain how they plan to improve screening to ensure the safety for the millions of travelers who use O   Hare     The text of the letter is below  The Honorable Kip Hawley  Administrator  Transportation Security Administration  601 South 12th Street  Arlington  VA 22202 4220 Dear Mr  Hawley    We are writing to request quick action to improve the detection of bomb materials at Chicago O   Hare International Airport and our nation   s other airports   Our letter is prompted by the recently released Transportation Security Administration  TSA  report indicating that undercover agents posing as passengers carrying materials for fake bombs were able to walk through airport security undetected at alarming rates during tests last year  According to yesterday   s USA Today  TSA carried out these tests at three of the nation   s busiest airports  including O   Hare International Airport in Chicago   Two other airports   Los Angeles International Airport and the San Francisco International Airport   joined O   Hare as the testing grounds for detection of bomb materials at passenger security checkpoints   Of the 75 passengers who carried fake explosives through screening stations at O   Hare  nearly 60  passed undetected   These passengers were able to slip past security with false detonators and explosive materials by hiding materials under their clothes and in everyday items such as CD cases  briefcase linings  and toiletry kits   These test results are a frightening reality check for travelers about the screening capability of our nation   s airports  Although some progress has been made since 9 11  the threat posed by terrorism is still real and is still evolving   Materials to make bombs can come in all shapes and sizes  can be hidden with common household items  and can be difficult to detect   It is critical that the TSA respond to these new challenges to stay ahead of the threat   In your October 16 testimony before the Senate Commerce  Transportation  and Science Committee  you stated      A lesson from 9 11 is that we must be proactive   we must anticipate threats that continue to grow in sophistication and complexity     Yet  a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report this month noted that although the TSA has recognized the need for better technology to detect such materials  this technology has not been deployed successfully   In its assessment  GAO rated the TSA   s ability to    deploy checkpoint technologies to address vulnerabilities    as    generally not achieved       We believe that the 60  failure rate at O   Hare demonstrates a failure that goes far beyond    generally not achieved       The Department of Transportation conducted similar covert tests in 2002 and found that screeners missed 60  of simulated bombs at that time   It is unacceptable that this number remains unchanged five years later   While we commend the TSA for continuously running these covert quality tests and for acknowledging the deficiencies in technology to detect explosives  these efforts are futile unless real changes are made    We would like prompt answers to the following questions  1          In last year   s tests  what types of deficiencies were identified that led to the poor testing results   What steps have been taken and will be taken to address those deficiencies   2          Were any deficiencies identified that were particular to O   Hare Airport    What steps have been taken and will be taken to address those deficiencies   3          What steps have been taken and will be taken to better train screeners so that they will more effectively detect bomb materials   4          What steps have been taken and will be taken to improve the performance of detection equipment to assist screeners in finding bomb materials   5          What targets have been established for improved performance in future tests    Thank you for your attention to this matter   We would appreciate a response within two weeks  Sincerely  Barack Obama

1726,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON IRAQ WAR
  Statement of Sen. Bernie Sanders on the Iraq War:
  Despite the strong wishes of the American people the war in Iraq drags on and on and on. More Americans and Iraqis are dead, more property is lost, $8 billion more a month is being spent, greater and greater stress is being placed on our active duty personnel as well as our National Guard.   
   Meanwhile, al Qaeda grows in influence and deadly effectiveness. While American troops see their tours of duty extended, IEDs and suicide bombing techniques learned in Iraq have now been exported to Afghanistan.
   In the last several months some real progress has been in Congress in changing our policies in Iraq but, clearly, more needs to be done.
   We have a majority of the Senate on record opposing the president's Iraq escalation policy. And now, the Senate has passed legislation that is responsible, that is binding, and that is bipartisan, requiring the safe redeployment of our brave troops to begin in 120 days with a goal of bringing the vast majority of our troops out of Iraq by the end of March 2008.  
   These are important steps toward ending the current open-ended mission in Iraq but much, much more needs to be done, which is why I am supporting the recently introduced Feingold-Reid legislation.  
   This bill uses Congress's constitutional spending power to force the president to safely redeploy troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008. After that point, the President can only spend money in Iraq for three specific and limited purposes: 
   * One - to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations; 
   * Two - to protect U.S. infrastructure and personnel; 
   * Three - to train and equip Iraqi security forces. 
   Let me be clear - this proposal will not cut funding for our brave men and women in uniform. Not one cent. They will still receive their salaries, body armor, and all the other resources they need. It would simply redeploy them to other areas where the military is utilized. 
   When they voted in November, Americans didn't just want us to simply oppose the ""surge."" They wanted us to end the war. And that's what some of us intend to do.   
   Both the Senate and the House have passed bills that give the troops the funding they need while also giving the American people what they are demanding - a change of course in Iraq. It's incredible that this president would veto funds for the troops because Congress chose to acknowledge the will of the American people.   
   We will not be deterred by a veto or by the self-deluding rhetoric coming from die-hard supporters of the president's misguided Iraq policy. We will only work harder to act on the ever-growing consensus that ending our military involvement in Iraq is the right thing to do for our troops, our national security, and our ongoing fight against the global terrorist networks that threaten the safety of all Americans.

1970,"CONGRESS APPROVES LARGEST INCREASE IN STUDENT AID
  Congress on Friday approved the largest increase in student aid since passage of the GI Bill after World War II. The legislation provides $17 billion in additional college aid, including $34.2 million over the next five years in new Pell grants for students attending colleges and universities in Vermont. Another $26.7 million is allotted for increased loans to Vermont students. Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate education committee, played a major role in pushing for higher Pell grants and for the creation of a loan forgiveness program that also is included in the bill. Loans would be cancelled for college graduates who stay in public service jobs - including nursing, education, and law enforcement - for a decade.
   ""This bill is the most significant improvement in higher education that we have seen in decades,"" Sanders said. He also noted that ""this is not costing taxpayers one nickel. It is paid for by lower subsidies for lenders."" 
   As college tuition soared while federal assistance stagnated, nearly a quarter of public four-year college graduates and over a third of private four-year college graduates leave school with too much debt. Between the 2000-2001 and 2005-2006 school years, the cost of college at four-year public colleges in Vermont increased 29 percent. The cost of four-year private colleges in Vermont rose 30 percent. ""Rising costs have placed a college education out of reach for too many hardworking Vermont students and families,"" Sanders said.
   In addition to forgiving loan debts for those in public service careers, the legislation Sanders helped write would increase grants to low-income students, raise the number of students eligible for the maximum Pell grant, decrease the penalty for students who work and receive financial aid, and make loan repayments more manageable for borrowers with significant loan debt by cutting interest rates.
   The maximum Pell Grant would go to $5,400 by 2012. Low-income Vermont students would be eligible for an additional $3.15 million in need-based grant aid next year and $34.2 million altogether over the next five years. In Vermont, the maximum Pell grant currently covers only 24 percent of the average public four-year college tuition, fees, room and board in 2005-2006 - down from 30 percent in 1986-1987.
   Also under the legislation, a cap on federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income would bring needed relief to students with excessive loan burdens. For example, a social worker with one child in Vermont earning $36,730, with average student loan debt of $19,482, would have his or her monthly payments reduced by $50, from $224 to $174.
   The Senate voted 79-to-12 for the higher education bill. It later passed the House of Representatives 292-to-97 and was sent to President Bush, who only on Thursday dropped a veto threat and is now expected to sign the bill.

McLean County  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today requested assistance from the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  in responding to the infestation   Assistance may include resources for surveillance activities  deploying traps  setting up and enforcing compliance agreements and quarantine areas   We are writing to inform you of the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Bloomington  Illinois  and to ask for your assistance in responding to this infestation   wrote the Illinois Senators    With more than 60 miles between discoveries  responding adequately to this infestation will require additional resources   This discovery is particularly troubling given the destructive power of the Emerald Ash Borer and the significant distance between this discovery and the previous southernmost discovery in Peru  Illinois     Last week  Durbin  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved  32 5 million for nationwide efforts to combat and prevent the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer  EAB    This funding represents an increase from the   30 7 million in last year s final Agriculture Appropriations bill    Additionally  the bill includes special language directing the US Department of Agriculture s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to work collaboratively with the City of Chicago to manage the infestation and provide appropriate resources   The Emerald Ash Borer  which has now been found in Cook County  DuPage County  Kane County  LaSalle County  McLean County and Will County  is a bright green beetle that kills trees by burrowing into their bark and destroying the trees  ability to bring water from the roots to upper branches  The bug is able to cause significant damage in a limited amount of time   infected trees usually begin to die within two to three years   Timely and concerted management efforts are vital to slow the spread of the infestation  Since it was first discovered in Michigan in 2002  the Emerald Ash Borer has killed more than 30 million trees and has spread to Indiana  Ohio  Maryland  Virginia  Pennsylvania  West

Schafer  We are writing to inform you of the recent discovery of Emerald Ash Borer  EAB  in Bloomington  Illinois  and to ask for your assistance in responding to this infestation   The Illinois Department of Agriculture announced this afternoon that the invasive pest was found in McLean County    This discovery is particularly troubling given the destructive power of the Emerald Ash Borer and the significant distance between this discovery and the previous southernmost discovery in Peru  Illinois   With more than 60 miles between discoveries  responding adequately to this infestation will require additional resources   For example  it is likely that surveillance activities will need to be increased around McLean County  requiring additional personnel   If the beetle has spread to areas between Peru and Bloomington  a significant increase in resources will be needed to manage the spread of this pest      As you know  since it was first discovered in Michigan in 2002  the Emerald Ash Borer has killed more than 30 million trees and has spread to Indiana  Ohio  Maryland  Virginia  Pennsylvania  West Virginia and Illinois   The bug is able to cause significant damage in a limited amount of time  which means that timely and concerted management efforts are vital to slow the spread of the infestation    Thankfully  the U S  Department of Agriculture has established a productive partnership with the Illinois Department of Agriculture  and progress has been made in providing resources to the state through a federal state cooperative agreement   In addition  Congress has provided additional resources to USDA s EAB program  which have been used to develop new EAB management techniques and technologies  We ask that you seriously consider the funding needs of the State of Illinois in responding to this discovery   In addition  we invite you to visit Illinois to observe the recent infestation    Sincerely                                 Pursuant to  policy

119,   Remarks by Senator Barack Obama on the Paris Hilton Tax Break   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Remarks by Senator Barack Obama on the Paris Hilton Tax Break Wednesday  June  7  2006  As prepared for delivery First of all  let s call this trillion dollar giveaway what it is   the Paris Hilton Tax Break   It s about giving billions of dollars to billionaire heirs and heiresses at a time when American taxpayers just can t afford it     The Republicans have brought out the Paris Hilton Tax Break in June because they re eager to make it an election issue in November     And I think that s fine   In fact  I m eager for the American people to choose   Because if people want their government to spend one trillion dollars   an amount more than double what we ve spent on Iraq  Afghanistan  and the War on Terror combined   on tax breaks for multimillionaires and multibillionaires  than the Republican Party is your party     If the American people want to borrow billions more from the Chinese  spend billions more in taxes to pay the interest on our debt  and watch billions cut from health care and education and Gulf Coast Reconstruction  then the Paris Hilton Tax Break is your tax break     This isn t about saving small businesses and family farms   We can reform the estate tax to protect these Americans   We can set it at a level where no small business or family farm is ever affected   and we can do it in a way that doesn t cost us a trillion dollars   In fact  we ve offered to reform the estate tax in this way time and time again     But over and over  our offer has been refused  which can only mean that the party in power is really interested in giving this money to the wealthiest of the wealthy    And so I would ask the American people one question   At a time like this   a time where America finds itself deeply in debt  struggling to pay for a war in Iraq  a war in Afghanistan  security for our homeland  armor for our troops  health care for our workers  and education for our children   at a time of all this need  can you imagine opening Forbes magazine  looking at their list of the 400 wealthiest Americans  and realizing that our government gave the people on that list over half a trillion dollars worth of tax breaks     I know I can t imagine that   And I would bet that most Americans can t imagine that either   So if the Republicans want to bring up their Paris Hilton Tax Break to use it as an election issue later  I say go for it   Because I can think of no better statement about where and how we differ in priorities than that                                    ,1

1227,November 15  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Canandaigua VA Local Advisory Panel Meeting Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton submitted the following statement to the Canandaigua VA Local Advisory Panel meeting today            November 15  2006      Mr  Jay Halpern  Designated Federal Officer  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20420      Dear Mr  Halpern     Statement for the Record of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Local Advisory Panel Meeting to Discuss the Future of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center      I am pleased that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   after time lag of over a year  is finally meeting with the Canandaigua Local Advisory Panel to receive input on the five remaining business plan options for the Canandaigua VA Medical Center   While I was happy to learn last month that the five remaining options retain nearly all of the services currently provided on the Canandaigua campus  it has been 15 months since the VA last consulted with the Local Advisory Panel  LAP   and I am concerned that our veterans have not had a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard   The LAP process is designed to insure that the input of veterans is taken into account before making decisions that directly affect the health care needs of thousands of veterans in New York and around the nation            Looking ahead  it is essential that the VA re commit to fully engaging local veterans and community leaders before making any final plans for Canandaigua   In particular  it would be premature for the VA to close the remaining acute inpatient psychiatric beds located at Canandaigua before a final decision on the various options for the facility has been made   Only by listening to our veterans and understanding their needs can we effectively follow through on our national promise that those who serve will have access to first rate health care at VA facilities          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0
1742,"SENS. SANDERS, CLINTON TEAM UP ON AMENDMENT TO COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY BILL
  ""Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is excited. And when Sanders - longtime maverick populist - is in that frame of mind, you know something right and smart is in the works,"" writes Katrina Vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation. ""In this case it's the Energy Savings Act of 2007, which the Senate is now debating. Sanders is so keen on this legislation because of the opportunity not only to address global warming and energy needs, but also to create millions of new jobs and make sure our workforce has the skills needed to fill them,"" she added. 
   Sanders and Senator Hillary Clinton teamed up on the amendment to the comprehensive energy bill, which would increase the production of clean renewable fuels and improve energy efficiency.
   ""I'm going to do everything I can to make this energy bill as strong as it possibly can be,"" Sanders said.
   ""We have to reverse greenhouse gas emissions, move away from fossil fuels into energy efficiency and into sustainable energy. The amendment we passed will provide for the training of thousands of workers who can earn good wages as they get involved in green technology?involved in installing photovoltaic units, wind turbines, and making our homes and offices more energy efficient.
   ""Also, we've got to be as aggressive as we can in raising CAFE [Corporate Average Fuel Economy] standards. It is absurd that the cars we are driving today get worse mileage per gallon than was the case 20 years ago. The technology is out there to give us cars that get very, very good mileage per gallon.
   ""Lastly, we have got to address rising gas prices. In my view the oil companies are ripping of the American people while they're making incredible profits. I believe in a windfall profits tax. We'll see what we can do. The opposition will be very strong but consumers in this country need protection from these huge oil companies.""
   The energy legislation would:
   * Require automakers to increase fuel economy of new vehicles to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. Current law requires 27.5 mpg for cars and 22.2 mpg for SUVs and small trucks.
   * Increase the use of biofuels.
   * Outlaw ""unconscionably excessive"" prices for gasoline and strengthen the power of investigators to look into market manipulation by the oil industry.
   * Increase the use of ethanol - produced from wood chips, prairie grass or corn - as a substitute for gasoline.

49,   Durbin  Obama  Emanuel  Illinois Members Ask For Meeting With US Steel Regarding Wastewater Permit That Violates Conditions of Clean Water Act   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Durbin  Obama  Emanuel  Illinois Members Ask For Meeting With US Steel Regarding Wastewater Permit That Violates Conditions of Clean Water Act Friday  October 12  2007  For Immediate Release    Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin   Amy Brundage  Obama   Kathleen Connery  Emanuel  or Sarah Feinberg  Nick Papas Call on Indiana Governor  US EPA  and Regional EPA to work with US Steel to protect Lake Michigan  WASHINGTON  D C      Continuing their effort to fight for the environmental health and protection of Lake Michigan  U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Congressman Rahm Emanuel  D IL  today  along with Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and members of the Chicago delegation  sent a letter to U S  Steel Corporation  calling for a meeting with the Chairman and CEO to discuss Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s  IDEM  proposal to give U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana a wastewater permit that would allow them to operate for five more years without complying with current clean water standards      Durbin and Emanuel also sent letters to both the EPA Administrator  and the Region 5 EPA office commending them for coming out in opposition to the permit and asking them to work with IDEM and U S  Steel to right the situation   They sent a fourth letter to the Governor of Indiana asking for his cooperation    In today s letter to U S  Steel the members wrote     Lake Michigan is our Grand Canyon  our Yellowstone  and we hope that you will join us in working to protect the lake   It is our understanding that US Steel has been working to come into compliance with clean water requirements at the Gary  Indiana facility for over a decade   We strongly oppose any efforts that might lead to an increase in the pollutants the Gary Works discharges into the Grand Calumet River  which feeds into Lake Michigan      According to an article in today   s Chicago Tribune  Gary Works  located about 15 miles southeast of Chicago  is the largest source of water pollution in the Lake Michigan basin  dumping more than 1 7 million pounds in 2005   The facility has been operating under an expired permit that has been extended by state officials since 1994   The proposed permit would allow Gary Works to increase its discharge of pollutants  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  and nitrates  into the Grand Calumet River  which flows directly into Lake Michigan   Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional 5 years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  Senator Durbin and Congressman Emanuel sent four letters regarding the proposed IDEM permit   In a letter to the EPA Administrator  Stephen Johnson  both Illinois members applauded EPA for rejecting the proposed IDEM permit and urged them to review all proposed permits in order to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act   Further  in their letter to the EPA Region 5 Administrator  Mary Gade  Durbin and Emanuel questioned U S  Steel   s compliance with the Clean Water Act  In their letter to the Governor of Indiana  Mitch Daniels  Durbin and Emanuel stressed that economic development and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   Finally  in a letter to the Chairman and CEO of U S  Steel Corporation  John Surma  signed by Durbin  Obama  Emanuel and members of the Chicago Congressional Delegation  they asked for a meeting to discuss the company   s decision to seek a permit that threatens water quality in Lake Michigan   text of letters below  October 12  2007 Mr  John P  Surma  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  United States Steel Corporation  600 Grant Street  Pittsburgh  PA 15219 Dear Mr  Surma  After reading this morning   s Chicago Tribune article regarding the proposed wastewater permit for your company   s Gary  Indiana facility  we write to express our strong concern and request a meeting with you to discuss the potential effects of this permit on the health of Lake Michigan and all of the Great Lakes  The Great Lakes account for 95  of the United States    surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans   Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures  and studies indicating that over 90  of shoreline in the Great Lakes region is polluted  Lake Michigan and the rest of the Great Lakes need greater environmental stewardship  not an increase in pollution   Economic development and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand    Lake Michigan is our Grand Canyon  our Yellowstone  and we hope that you will join us in working to protect the lake   It is our understanding that US Steel has been working to come into compliance with clean water requirements at the Gary  Indiana facility for over a decade   We strongly oppose any efforts that might lead to an increase in the pollutants the Gary Works discharges into the Grand Calumet River  which feeds into Lake Michigan   Due to a public dialogue and the involvement of concerned local citizens  BP reconsidered their decision to increase their permitted discharge levels and is now working to expand their Whiting refinery without discharging more ammonia and other pollutants into Lake Michigan   We urge you to reconsider your company   s decision to seek a permit that threatens water quality in Lake Michigan and invite you to meet with us to discuss this important issue   Please contact Jen Waller in Congressman Emanuel   s office at 202 225 4061 or Michael Kolenc in Senator Durbin   s office at 202 224 9447 to set up a meeting  and we look forward to hearing from you  Sincerely    October 12  2007  Ms  Mary Gade  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency Region 5  77 W  Jackson Blvd   Chicago  IL 60604  Dear Ms  Gade   We are writing today to express our strong concern about the Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s proposed wastewater permit for U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana    We commend you for formally objecting to the proposed permit and urge you to work with the Indiana Department of Environmental Management  IDEM  to ensure that any new permits issued do not further threaten the health and water quality of Lake Michigan    Compliance with the Clean Water Act calls for a steady reduction in pollutants discharged into public waters   After nearly a decade  it appears that U S  Steel is still not in compliance with either the Clean Water Act or the standards in the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative  GLI    We encourage you to ensure that the final permit makes significant strides towards minimizing pollutants      Following this latest news about IDEM   s proposed U S  Steel permit and the recent controversy over BP   s NPDES permit for their Whiting refinery  we are concerned about additional permits under consideration in Indiana   We urge you to undertake a detailed review of any additional  state approved permits to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act   EPA   s oversight role is critical as we work together to ensure the health of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes  Sincerely  Rahm Emanuel                                        Member of Congress                                           Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator   October 12  2007  The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator   U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave NW  Washington  DC 20460  Dear Administrator Johnson   We are writing to express our strong concern over the Indiana Department of Environmental Management   s proposed wastewater permit for U S  Steel Corporation   s Gary Works facility in Gary  Indiana   According to many experts  the permit would allow the Gary Works to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River  including oil lead  arsenic  benzene  nitrates and more    Additionally  the permit would grant U S  Steel an additional five years to meet federal standards for several other pollutants  most notably ammonia and mercury  As such  we are relieved to hear that the EPA has formally objected to this permit  particularly with regard to the discharge limits and five year compliance schedules   A mere three months ago  we wrote to express our concern regarding IDEM   s permit for BP   s Whiting  Indiana facility   There are still unanswered questions regarding that permit and EPA   s oversight of its issuance  and we hope that the EPA will work with Indiana to make sure that permits issued by IDEM do not threaten the health of the Great Lakes   We all want to work together to protect Lake Michigan    It has come to our attention that there may be additional permits being reviewed by IDEM and we urge you to undertake a detailed review of all proposed permits to ensure compliance with the Clean Water Act and the standards of the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative  GLI    It   s time to improve rather than threaten the health of Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes  As you are well aware  President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force in order to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      We agree with the President that the Great Lakes are among our nation   s greatest treasures  and we need to take action to protect them   We thank you for objecting to the proposed permit allowing U S  Steel to increase the pollutants they discharge into the Grand Calumet River and hope that we can work with you as you revise the permit with the state of Indiana to draft a permit consistent with the Clean Water Act  the GLI  and the goal of improving the health of the Great Lakes   Sincerely    Rahm Emanuel

Honorable Mitch Daniels  Governor   Dear Governor Daniels  After reading this morning   s Chicago Tribune article regarding the proposed wastewater permit for US Steel   s Gary  Indiana  facility  we write to express our strong concern about the potential impact of this proposal and others like it on the health of Lake Michigan   President Bush issued an executive order in May of 2004 to establish a Great Lakes Interagency Task Force to promote a regional collaboration for the Great Lakes   In the executive order  the President stated that it    is the policy of the Federal Government to support local and regional efforts to address environmental challenges and to encourage local citizen and community stewardship      The permit currently under review by the State of Indiana appears to move in the opposite direction   You sit in a unique position  with the potential to make a positive  lasting impact on the Lake   The State of Indiana can and should work with industry in the state to encourage compliance with the Clean Water Act goals and to participate as stewards of Lake Michigan     We all know how important Lake Michigan is for our states and for the country   The Great Lakes account for 95 percent of the United States    surface freshwater and provide drinking water for more than 30 million Americans   Between the startling increases in fish consumption advisories  record numbers of beach closures  and studies indicating that over 90 percent of shoreline in the Great Lakes region is polluted  Lake Michigan and the other Great Lakes need greater environmental stewardship  not greater levels of pollution    We believe that economic infrastructure and protecting the Great Lakes can and should go hand in hand   U S  Steel   s Gary Works is one of the region   s biggest employers and contributes to the supply of domestic steel   Our hope is that as U S  Steel serves these functions for our region  it also will recognize its obligation to more aggressively mitigate pollutants discharged into the public waterways   We urge the State of Indiana to reevaluate this permit  and work with the EPA and U S  Steel to protect the Lake      Sincerely   Rahm Emanuel                                        Member of Congress                                           Richard J  Durbin  U S  Senator                                  ,1

382,   Senators Seek Tax Relief for Flood and Tornado Victims in the Midwest    U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Senators Seek Tax Relief for Flood and Tornado Victims in the Midwest  Tuesday  June 24  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C     Senators Dick Durbin  D IL   Barack Obama  D IL   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   Claire McCaskill  D MO   Kit Bond  R MO   Richard Lugar  R IN   Amy Klobuchar  D MN  and Evan Bayh  D IN  have filed an amendment to the housing legislation that s pending in the Senate   The amendment is a tax relief measure designed to help people and communities in Midwestern states hard hit over the last month by floods and tornados  The senators said the Midwestern Disaster Tax Relief bill is modeled after tax legislation that Congress passed to help victims of the tornado in Kiowa County  Kansas in 2007 and Hurricanes Katrina  Rita and Wilma in 2005   The new proposal contains provisions that would let disaster victims withdraw money from retirement plans without tax penalties  suspend limits on tax incentives for charitable contributions  create tax exempt bond authority to help rebuild infrastructure  remove limitations on deducting casualty losses due to natural disaster  and allow additional depreciation and increased amounts for expensing property to help businesses   As residents continue to battle the flooding back home in Illinois  I will continue to work in Washington to see that they have access to every federal recovery tool   Durbin said    Tax relief has proven to be extremely useful in helping people and communities get back on their feet after a major disaster   I hope Congress will act swiftly so Illinoisans will have immediate access to relief funds as soon as the President makes a disaster declaration for Illinois    Families and communities across Illinois have suffered so much due to this year s flooding  and we must do everything we can to help them recover and begin to rebuild   said Obama    I am proud to support this amendment to offer tax relief and assistance to the victims of this disaster   I will continue to work with Senator Durbin and my colleagues to help rebuild the Midwest in the days and weeks ahead     Tax relief has been important and helpful to tornado and hurricane victims in recent years  and it s just as important for people in Iowa and other Midwestern states this year who have

1815,"SEN. SANDERS TO MEET WITH SENIORS ADVISORY COUNCIL
  Sen. Bernie Sanders will meet Monday with his newly formed Seniors Advisory Council at his U.S. Senate office in Burlington. After the first meeting, the senator and members of the advisory council will hold a press conference on legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs. 
   Sanders was the first member of Congress to take constituents across the Canadian border to buy prescription drugs at a fraction of the price charged in the United States. He plans to press as early as next week for a Senate vote on re-importation legislation proposed by a tri-partisan coalition that Sanders has helped lead for the past eight years since his 1999 bus trip to Canada. He also favors making Medicare use its bargaining leverage to lower the costs of prescription drugs, a step that Senate Republicans blocked on Wednesday.
   Throughout his career in Congress, Sanders has taken on the powerful pharmaceutical industry lobby that spent more than $900 million during the past decade to influence Congress to keep drug prices high. 
   What: News conference on Sanders Seniors Advisory Council and legislation to lower prescription drug costs 
   Who: Senator Bernie Sanders; Jennifer Wallace-Brodeur, Associate State Director of AARP, John Barbour, executive director of the Champlain Valley Agency on Aging, and Betty Stambolian, Alliance of Retired Americans Executive Board Member

1903,"400 LOCAL OFFICIALS SHOW SUPPORT FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM
  The National League of Cities (NLC) today presented key Senators with the signatures of nearly 400 local officials from 46 states in support of funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. In a meeting today with Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), NLC officials displayed 400 energy-efficient light bulbs representing the innovative work already occurring in cities and towns across the country to advance energy conservation.
   ""Funding for the program will enable local officials to take new actions or build on the many existing approaches leading toward greater energy independence and security. The light bulbs represent one example of the kind of partnerships cities and towns can forge with local businesses and non-profits under the provisions of the Grant program,"" said NLC President Cynthia McCollum today during the presentation ceremony on the steps of the US Capitol. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc, donated the light bulbs as part of their commitment to energy conservation. NLC plans to give the bulbs to the Newark, NJ, Housing Authority. 
   Securing full funding for the Block Grant is a top legislative priority for NLC and the nation's cities and towns. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 authorized $2 billion annually for the newly created Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program. In a letter delivered today to the chairs and members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, McCollum and the nearly 400 local officials urged support for a supplemental appropriations for FY 2008 as well as full funding for FY 2009. The Appropriations Committees are expected to take up the measure in the coming weeks.
   McCollum said, ""Municipal governments can have considerable influence over greenhouse gas emissions. Cities are already taking action to save money; promote new jobs; reduce waste; and support new technology. Funding from the Grant can help cities and towns leverage more dollars from other sources to help solve what is a national problem. This will enable us all to preserve our natural resources for future generations.""
   Senator Sanders said, ""The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant program is modeled after the highly successful Community Development Block Grants. This new program is intended to support on-the-ground efforts by cities, towns, and states as they tackle our serious energy challenges. The program provides federal recognition of grassroots efforts and supports their pursuit of solutions that reduce fossil fuel emissions, reduce total energy use, and improve energy efficiency. I truly believe that there is infinite potential in the new program and hope that Vermont towns step forward, once funding is available.""
   ""The signs that we need to become a more energy-efficient and ultimately energy-independent nation are hard to miss - gas nearing $4 a gallon, climate change and our souring economy are just a few,"" said Senator Menendez. ""Our nation's cities have been leading the way to make us a greener, more secure country. This block grant program will reward and encourage this local leadership. Hopefully, one day soon, the federal government will follow the lead of our cities, because the sooner we green our economy, the sooner we can heal our environment, our economy, and our relationship with the world. I applaud the National League of Cities for its work toward this goal.""
   Seven of NLC's corporate partners also expressed their support for funding for the Block Grant program by delivering a joint letter stating, ""As corporate leaders...we share the belief that funding would enable cities to continue an important partnership with the federal government in implementing innovative energy efficiency and conservation programs that benefit both the local and national economy."" Organizations signing the letter include: AT&T, ESRI, ICMA-RC, Johnson Controls, Southern California Edison, Waste Management, and Weston Solutions.
   Areas where cities can focus their energy efficiency and conservation efforts under the Grant could include:
   * Public buildings and facilities such as sports stadiums, landfills, and waste treatment plants which either consume large amounts of energy or produce greenhouse gases;
   * Building codes to encourage energy efficiency;
   * Regulation of automobile parking, roadways and traffic flow, and use of energy-efficient street lights;
   * Procurement of ""green"" products such as recycled paper and fleets of clean energy vehicles (transit, trucks or autos); and

786,December 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the U S  Ratifying the Hague Adoption Convention                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  I am pleased that the United States will ratify the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption tomorrow  By doing so  our nation   the world s leader in international adoptions   will join more than seventy nations committed to uniform policies  procedures and safeguards to ensure as many secure international adoptions as possible  By signing this treaty  we will help smooth the way for tens of thousands of people looking to build loving families through adoption  According to the State Department  over the past seven years  Americans have adopted almost 120 000 children from overseas  Many more would have adopted  but have been hindered by the bureaucratic process of international adoption      This news has been long awaited  and I have been a strong advocate for moving towards this day  The United States signed the Hague Convention in 1994  In 2000  my husband signed into law the Intercountry Adoption Act  which provides for the implementation of the Convention regulations  In October  I sent a letter to Secretary Rice urging the Department of State to complete the rule making process to enable the US to ratify the Convention  I also joined my colleagues in urging President Berger of Guatemala to work swiftly towards implementing the Convention regulations to help the more than 3 000 children whose prospective adoptions have been placed on hold   It is my hope that the Guatemalan government continues its efforts to implement a Hague compliant system  I also joined with a Senate coalition in sending a letter to UNICEF requesting they join the Hague Permanent Bureau and the United States Department of State in publicly supporting the processing of pending adoption applications to allow for a smooth  timely  and transparent transition to the Hague Convention for Guatemalan children and their future families     For more than thirty five years  I have worked as a mother  an advocate  a lawyer  a First Lady and a Senator on behalf of children in America and around the world  As First Lady  I worked with Congress to establish the Adoption Incentives program  which has more than doubled the number of children adopted out of foster care  In the Senate  I strongly supported legislation  which has become law  to reauthorize the Adoption Incentives program while providing stronger incentives for the adoption of children with special needs and older children  I also co sponsored legislation to increase the tax credit for special needs adoptions from  6 000 to  10 000 and the tax credit for non special needs adoptions from  5 000 to  10 000  I will continue to be a strong advocate for streamlining the adoption process in  order to help more children find the permanent  loving families they deserve         ,0
1894,"NUMBER OF AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE ROSE 47 MILLION, ACCORDING TO U.S. CENSUS BUREAU REPORT RELEASED ON AUG. 28
  The number of Americans without health insurance rose to a record 47 million, according to a U.S. Census Bureau report released Tuesday. Among children, the situation was even worse. Almost 12 percent of people younger than 18 had no health insurance in 2005. It was the second year in a row when the number rose. The new figures add fuel to a debate over Bush administration plans to limit enrollment in the popular Children's Health Insurance Program. Under new eligibility restrictions that Senator Bernie Sanders will fight to undo, coverage for more than 2,000 of the 3,000 children enrolled in Vermont's Dr. Dynasaur program is in jeopardy.
   The Senate and House have passed separate bills that would increase funding and make it possible to enroll millions of children for coverage. Even before the administration issued new eligibility rules, the White House had threatened to veto the bills. Said Sanders, ""We are the only major nation which does not provide health insurance for all children. Instead of throwing kids off health care, Bush should be working with us to cover more kids.""
   The main reason that 2.2 million more Americans lacked coverage was that more and more employers are dropping health insurance for workers. Altogether, 15.8 percent of Americans had no health insurance last year, an increase from 15.3 percent in 2005.

1914,"AS GOES GREENLAND...SO GOES THE PLANET
  A bipartisan delegation from the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee traveled to Greenland to study the impact of global warming. ""Not only were the vistas that we saw breathtaking, but we learned a lot. The bottom line: As goes Greenland, so goes the United States, so goes the planet Earth. If the ice sheet in Greenland continues to melt, billions of people from one end of this planet to the other, including some of the poorest people in the world in Asia, will suffer terribly,"" Sanders said at a Capitol press conference the day after returning from Greenland.
   ""It is shocking that something as huge as the Greenland ice sheet is at risk of being lost because of our actions, but this is the reality I witnessed firsthand,"" Sanders said. ""We saw a sea of ice that holds much of our history literally melting away in front of our eyes. We heard from political leaders, scientists, and others that things are simply out of whack. 
   ""The bad news,"" Sanders continued, ""is that we have been very late to getting into the game.""
   ""The good news,"" he added, ""is that all over the world we know what has to be done. This is not a problem that we do not know how to solve. It makes no sense at all that we continue to drive cars that get worse mileage per gallon than 20 years ago. You don't have to be a great scientist to figure that out. It doesn't make any sense that in our homes and factories and offices we're wasting all kinds of energy. We know that. We know to a significant degree what we have to do. And I know that under Senator Boxer's leadership on this Committee we are going to do the right thing. We're going to demand energy efficiency in this country. We're going to demand a significant movement for sustainable energy.
   ""The United States Congress must not wait another day to provide the international leadership that global warming demands, leadership that the Bush administration has miserably failed to demonstrate,"" he added. ""While there will be challenges in changing our behavior to reverse global warming, I strongly believe that the new opportunities for green jobs and a green economy are unlimited if we stand up and take bold action.""
   Sanders was among 10 senators on the two-day trip to Kangerlussuaq and Ilulissat on Greenland's west coast. The delegation was led by Senator Barbara Boxer, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and SebatirJohnny Isakson, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure.
   The delegation visited the Kangia Ice Fjord near Illulissat on Saturday, and toured iceberg-filled Disko Bay by boat on Sunday. The Kangia, which two decades ago already was one of the world's fastest moving glaciers, has since then doubled its speed, an acceleration scientists say is driven by rising global temperatures.
   Accompanying the Senators on the trip was Dr. Richard Alley, a professor at Pennsylvania State University who is one of the world's foremost experts on ice and global warming. Dr. Alley was lead author for the pivotal Working Group I report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Senators also were also briefed by Danish climate scientist Dr. Minik Rosing, Ph.D., and Danish Environment Minister Connie Hedegaard, and Greenland Minister of the Environment Arkalo Abelsen.
   Sanders and Boxer are the lead sponsors of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, which calls for reducing emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The bill is cosponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy.

721,December 10  2007 Senator Clinton Cosponsors Legislation to Improve Transparency and Accountability at Private Prisons                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today co sponsored the Private Prison Information Act of 2007  legislation introduced by Senator Joe Lieberman to increase transparency and accountability at private prisons   The Private Prison Information Act of 2007 will help to prevent abuse and neglect at private prisons by requiring public disclosure of information about their operations      As the federal government continues to contract out the incarceration of federal prisoners  it is essential that there be public disclosure about the operation of these private prisons  Senator Clinton said   Right now  the public does not have the same right of access to information about private prisons as it has for federal prisons   There is a lack of accountability into how tax dollars are being spent  which can place the safety of correctional officers  surrounding communities  and prisoners at risk   This legislation will help to ensure that citizens and elected officials can properly assess the performance of private prisons and  if necessary  hold them accountable for misconduct      Currently  federal law does not require private prisons that house federal prisoners to disclose information to the public about the daily operation of their facilities  and many private prisons do not submit reports to the federal government   This legislation will require private prisons that house federal prisoners to provide the same information available to the public that federal prisons are required to provide under the Freedom of Information Act    Approximately 27 000 federal criminal prisoners are serving time in private prison facilities   Additionally  more than 40 000 of the immigrants and asylum seekers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains each year are held in private detention centers   Studies have shown that correctional officers at privately run prisons are paid less  receive less training  and experience higher turnover rates than those at prisons run by government agencies   These differences can lead to greater rates of assaults on staff  inmate on inmate assaults  and escape attempts      The bill is supported by a broad coalition of associations representing correctional officers and law enforcement officers and public interest and advocacy groups  including Corrections USA  the Sheriff Officers Association of Nassau County  NY   the Suffolk County Correctional Officers Association  N Y   the Westchester County Correctional Superior Officers Association  N Y   the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  AFSCME   the American Federation of Government Employees  AFGE   Amnesty International USA  and the Center for Constitutional Rights         ,0

1846,"SEN. SANDERS' CLEAN POWER ACT OF 2007
  Power plants are the number one source of global warming pollution in the United States. While Congress must work toward an economy-wide approach to addressing global warming, there is no reason that power plants should not begin reducing their greenhouse gas emissions now, at the same time they are reducing emissions of other air pollutants. 
   Under current EPA regulations, power plants are putting on some controls to reduce smog, soot and mercury pollution. The technology exists, however, for power plants to make deeper reductions - reductions that will be more protective of the public health and the environment. In fact, deeper reductions are needed for states to meet air quality standards that will reduce asthma attacks, premature death, and other health problems, as well as protect sensitive groups, such as children and pregnant women, from mercury poisoning. 
  The Clean Power Act of 2007 will achieve dramatic reductions of four major pollutants emitted by power plants - carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and mercury - and set the power sector on a course to meet the nation's targets for reducing global warming pollution from all sectors. Specifically, my bill would achieve the following emission reductions: 
   * Carbon dioxide emissions would be reduced to 2.3 billion metric tons by 2011 (2006 levels), 2.1 billion metric tons by 2015, 1.8 billion metric tons by 2020 (1990 levels) and 1.5 billion metric tons by 2025 (17% below 1990 levels). 
   * Nitrogen oxide emissions would be reduced to 1.5 million tons by 2010 and 900,000 tons by 2013. 
   * Sulfur dioxide emissions would be reduced to 2.25 million tons by 2010 and 1.3 million tons by 2013. 
   * Mercury emissions would be capped at 5 tons, with facility-specific reductions of at least 90% capture, and no trading would be allowed. 
   The bill uses a cap-and-trade approach for reducing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions. Allowances equal to the caps would be distributed as follows:
   * For carbon dioxide, an increasing percentage of allowances would be auctioned, starting with at least 50% for 2020 and moving up to 100% in 15 years, with updating of allowance allocations every five years. Those allowances not auctioned would be allocated by EPA based on specified considerations, including impacts on electricity consumers. 
   * For nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides, allowances would be allocated consistent with current law until 2012 and at EPA's discretion thereafter. 
   My bill would also speed up the technological research, development and deployment necessary to transform the power sector for the 21st Century by:
   * Establishing carbon dioxide performance standards for new power plants that would prevent the construction of traditional carbon dioxide-intensive coal plants. 
   * Establishing a program to fully deploy geologic carbon sequestration. 
   * Reducing electricity use by establishing an efficiency program that would reduce energy use by 9% by 2020. 
   * Increasing the use of renewable electricity by establishing a Renewable Portfolio Standard of 20% by 2020. 
   The Clean Power Act of 2007 also makes specific linkages to an economy-wide reduction of pollutants responsible for global warming. It accomplishes this by specifying that if Congress has not passed, and the President has not signed, legislation affecting at least 85% of manmade sources of global warming pollutants by 2012, that the emissions from power plants must be decreased each year by 3% until atmospheric concentrations of global warming pollutants are stabilized at 450 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent.

674,   Obama Offers Plan to Stop Escalation of Iraq War  Begin Phased Redeployment of Troops   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Offers Plan to Stop Escalation of Iraq War  Begin Phased Redeployment of Troops Tuesday  January 30  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 30  2007  Obama Offers Plan to Stop Escalation of Iraq War  Begin Phased Redeployment of Troops Goal to Redeploy All Combat Brigades out of Iraq by March 31  2008   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced binding and comprehensive legislation that not only reverses the President s dangerous and ill conceived escalation of the Iraq war  but also sets a new course for U S  policy that can bring a responsible end to the war and bring our troops home    Our troops have performed brilliantly in Iraq  but no amount of American soldiers can solve the political differences at the heart of somebody else s civil war   Obama said   That s why I have introduced a plan to not only stop the escalation of this war  but begin a phased redeployment that can pressure the Iraqis to finally reach a political settlement and reduce the violence     The Obama plan offers a responsible yet effective alternative to the President s failed policy of escalation   Realizing there can be no military solution in Iraq  it focuses instead on reaching a political solution in Iraq  protecting our interests in the region  and bringing this war to a responsible end   The legislation commences redeployment of U S  forces no later than May 1  2007 with the goal of removing all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date that is consistent with the expectation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group    The plan allows for a limited number of U S  troops to remain as basic force protection  to engage in counter terrorism  and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces   If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the thirteen benchmarks for progress laid out by the Bush Administration  this plan also allows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment  provided Congress agrees that the benchmarks have been met and that the suspension is in the national security interest of the United States     The American people have been asked to be patient too many times  too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent   Obama said   It s time for a policy that can bring a responsible end to this war and bring our troops home    Fact Sheet  The Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007 Today  Senator Obama introduced the Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007   The Iraq War De escalation Act of 2007 is binding and comprehensive legislation that not only reverses the President s dangerous and ill conceived escalation  but also sets a new course for U S  policy in Iraq that can bring a responsible end to the war and bring our troops home   It implements   with the force of law   a phased redeployment of U S  forces that remains our best leverage to pressure the Iraqi government to achieve the political solution necessary to promote stability   It also places conditions on future economic aid to the government of Iraq and calls for the United States to lead a broad and sustained diplomatic initiative within the region   This plan is based on Senator Obama s November 20th  2006 speech before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs  and it implements key recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group     The Obama plan offers a responsible yet effective alternative to the President s failed policy of escalation   Realizing there can be no military solution in Iraq  it focuses instead on reaching a political solution in Iraq  protecting our interests in the region  and bringing this war to a responsible end   The legislation commences redeployment of U S  forces no later than May 1  2007 with the goal of removing all combat brigades from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date that is consistent with the expectation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group   The plan allows for a limited number of U S  troops to remain as basic force protection  to engage in counter terrorism  and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces   If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the thirteen benchmarks for progress laid out by the Bush Administration  this plan also allows for the temporary suspension of the redeployment  provided Congress agrees that the benchmarks have been met and that the suspension is in the national security interest of the United States     In short  the Obama plan halts the escalation and requires a responsible  phased redeployment of American forces from Iraq in a manner that protects U S  troops and exerts leverage to achieve the political settlement among the Iraqis   Key Elements of Obama Plan Stops the Escalation  Caps the number of U S  troops in Iraq at the number in Iraq on January 10  2007   This does not affect the funding for our troops in Iraq  This cap has the force of law and could not be lifted without explicit Congressional authorization  De escalates the War with Phased Redeployment   Commences a phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq not later than May 1  2007  with the goal that all combat brigades redeploy from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date consistent with the expectation of the Iraq Study Group   This redeployment will be both substantial and gradual  and will be planned and implemented by military commanders   Makes clear that Congress believes troops should be redeployed to the United States  to Afghanistan  and to other points in the region  A residual U S  presence may remain in Iraq for force protection  training of Iraqi security forces  and pursuit of international terrorists  Enforces Tough Benchmarks for Progress    These 13 benchmarks are based on President Bush s own statements and Administration documents and include  Security  Significant progress toward fulfilling security commitments  including eliminating restrictions on U S  forces  reducing sectarian violence  reducing the size and influence of the militias  and strengthening the Iraqi Army and Police  Political Accommodation  Significant progress toward reaching a political solution  including equitable sharing of oil revenues  revision of de Baathification  provincial elections  even handed provision of government services  and a fair process for a constitutional amendment to achieve national reconciliation  Economic Progress   Requires Iraq to fulfill its commitment to spend not less than  10 billion for reconstruction  job creation  and economic development without regard for the ethnic or sectarian make up of Iraqi regions    Should these benchmarks be met  the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment  subject to the agreement of Congress    Congressional oversight   Requires the President to submit reports to Congress every 90 days describing and assessing the Iraqi government s progress in meeting benchmarks and the redeployment goals  Intensified Training  Intensifies training of Iraqi security forces to enable the country to take over security responsibility of the country  Conditions on Economic Assistance   Conditions future economic assistance to the Government of Iraq on significant progress toward achievement of benchmarks   Allows exceptions for humanitarian  security  and job creation assistance   Regional Diplomacy  Launches a comprehensive regional and international diplomatic initiative   that includes key nations in the region   to help achieve a political settlement among the Iraqi people  end the civil war in Iraq  and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and regional conflict   Recommends the President should appoint a Special Envoy for Iraq to carry out this diplomacy within 60 days   Mandates that the President submit a plan to prevent the war in Iraq from becoming a wider regional conflict                                     ,1

1475,March 18  2005 Senator Clinton Highlights Senate Budget Resolution Strengths and Weaknesses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Citing her continued grave concern about the devastating impact that the President s budget cuts will have on New York  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today vowed to continue to build upon some of the progress that was made in the Senate Budget Resolution where some of the Bush Administration s most egregious cuts were restored  Senator Clinton worked with her colleagues throughout the week to beat back some of the Administration s cuts to critical health  education and community development programs          Make no mistake about it  the President s budget is an attack on working families and we must all continue to fight against it  While I am pleased that we were able to restore some of the cuts to critical programs like Medicaid  I remain deeply troubled by attempts to dismantle other vital programs  I am particularly disturbed by this Administration s determination to shut down Amtrak and hope that other state and local leaders will come to this vital service s side as well   Senator Clinton said         Several major initiatives that Senator Clinton and her colleagues succeeded in including in the final budget resolution are as follows              Medicaid    Senator Clinton co sponsored an amendment  along with Senators Smith  OR  and Bingaman  NM   that passed in the final resolution to restore a  15 billion cut in Medicaid nationally   2 billion for New York  The amendment also would create a bipartisan commission to recommend solutions to strengthen and reform Medicaid             Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program   This amendment will provide  2 07 billion in funding to restore the CDBG program and other critical aid programs for towns and cities that faced elimination under the President s Budget              Education    Senator Clinton co sponsored an education amendment that provides  773 7 million to restore the President s cuts to GEAR UP and TRIO  including  306 5 million for GEAR UP and  467 2 million for TRIO  Upward Bound   312 556 million  Talent Search   144 887 million  and other TRIO cut   9 710 million   This amendment restores college access services to over 1 8 million low income and first generation middle and high school students  including nearly 40 000 New York students              Flu Vaccine Shortage Prevention    The Senate adopted the Clinton Gregg  NH  amendment that will help prevent future flu vaccine shortages and strengthen flu tracking and response efforts              Comparative Effectiveness    Senator Clinton sponsored an amendment that was included in the budget resolution that will support comparative effectiveness research that compares the safety and effectiveness of new prescription drugs  medical treatments and devices to other similar treatments for the same illnesses and medical conditions  allowing patients and health care providers to make more informed decisions about their medical care  In addition to enhancing safety  comparative effectiveness studies improve quality and reduce costs that come from prescribing a drug or other medical procedure that may be more expensive and no more effective than other similar options  and could have negative health consequences that require additional treatment  hospitalizations  or other medical interventions that drive up costs        Senator Clinton said   It was a tough fight  but  ultimately  a majority of my colleagues joined me in making sure Medicaid  educational programs and other vital initiatives were included in the final passage of fiscal year 2006 Budget Resolution  We now must continue to fight for these programs in conference  Unfortunately there are also still many programs that the President has slashed or under funded and I hope that my Republican colleagues will work with us to address some of these misplaced priorities         Major amendments that were defeated by Senate Republicans and not included in the final budget resolution that Senator Clinton is committed to fighting for include             Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP     President Bush sharply reduced LIHEAP funding in his FY  06 budget with New York losing more than  28 million from last year s funding  Senator Clinton strongly supported an amendment that would restore those cuts  but it was defeated by the Republican majority              COPS Program    Under Bush s budget proposal  this program is reduced from  379 million to  118 million nationally  Additionally  absolutely no funding is proposed for the COPS Universal Hiring Program  the COPS MORE program  COPS in Schools program  or the COPS Interoperable Communications Technology Program  Senator Clinton cosponsored an amendment offered by the Senate Democrats that would have fully restored funding for this successful program  but was defeated              Veterans Healthcare    Under the President s proposal  the VA system is under funded by nearly  2 8 billion dollars  The Republican Senate defeated an amendment co sponsored by Senator Clinton that would have restored the funding and would have paid for this increased funding through closing corporate tax

1936,"SENATORS CALL ON BUSH TO HELP POOREST NATIONS DEAL WITH CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE
  As the largest-ever world climate change conference gets underway in Bali, a group of U.S. Senators, led by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ), is urging President Bush to help poorer nations cope with the problems caused by climate change, in order to prevent unimaginable hardship in those countries and the potential of greater instability worldwide (PDF or letter: http://menendez.senate.gov/pdf/120407lettertowhitehouse.pdf).
   Senators Menendez, Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-DE), John Kerry (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Christopher Dodd (D-CT) and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) are urging the president to secure an agreement coming out of the 13th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change that will ensure meaningful assistance to developing countries to cope with the severe impacts of climate change. The Senators point out that such assistance to vulnerable nations is a moral imperative and can help prevent global conflict and instability brought on by refugees and a scarcity of resources. 
   ""We are experiencing a planetary emergency, which means that we're all in this together,"" said Senator Menendez, Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Development and Foreign Assistance, Economic Affairs, and International Environmental Protection. ""Natural disasters on one side of the globe will affect people on the other side, so the response to climate change must be worldwide in scale. It is not only in our moral interest as the world's strongest nation but certainly also in our national interest to help the world's poorest nations cope with climate change and to help preserve global peace when the severe climate consequences come to bear. President Bush must treat this as the true emergency that it is and help the world prepare.""
   ""Global warming knows no borders and many of the countries most at risk from the consequences have done little to cause the problem,"" said Senator Biden, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""Supporting their efforts to deal with climate change will reduce the threat of instability in these fragile states, and will help build consensus for a global solution.""
   ""As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and wealthiest nation on earth, America needs to lead the effort to help at-risk nations adapt to climate change,"" said Senator Kerry. ""These vulnerable populations are feeling the effects of climate change more than anyone on earth. They are watching their homelands suffer from flooding, droughts, destroyed crops and severe storms, but are without the capabilities to respond. To meet the challenge of global climate change, we must take immediate action to reduce our emissions here at home, but we also must ensure we do not leave the most disadvantaged behind.""
   ""All over the world, people grapple with the crisis of global warming,"" said Senator Sanders. ""We are facing an enormous tragedy if we do not get our act together. We need bold leadership in confronting this potential catastrophe.""
   ""The United States must demonstrate responsible leadership to address the crisis of global warming,"" said Senator Dodd. ""To do so, we must work with the global community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work to protect impoverished nations that will be most affected by climate change. The crisis of global warming is moving at an astounding rate and President Bush must take action now.""

   December 4, 2007
   The Honorable George W. Bush
  The White House
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.
  Washington, D.C. 20500
   Dear Mr. President:
   As the 13th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change gets underway in Bali, Indonesia, we write to urge you to support a post-2012 international climate change framework that will include robust and effective assistance to vulnerable developing countries to adapt to the severe impacts of climate change. The United States and the global community must make commitments to deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but addressing global warming cannot just be about reducing emissions. If the United States is going to demonstrate true leadership, we must fulfill our obligation to protect those who are most in need.
   As you are aware, impoverished countries will be hit first and worst by climate change and have the least capacity to cope with increasingly devastating impacts, including water scarcity, droughts, sea-level rise, floods, severe weather events, disruption of agricultural production, and spread of disease. Indeed, climate change is quickly becoming a major driver of poverty around the world.
   Ensuring assistance to vulnerable countries facing these impacts is a moral commitment our country should make to the poorest around the world. Moreover, taking such action is in our national interest. Providing assistance to prevent some of the worst outcomes from climate change will reduce the costs of later providing disaster assistance or famine relief. Addressing the needs of poor communities will also help to stem the international conflict and instability that will likely be caused by the movement of climate refugees and resource scarcity.
   Many of the least developed countries are looking to the United States to support the inclusion of adaptation assistance in a post-2012 climate agreement. Unfortunately, the current level of international funding available to developing countries for adaptation is wholly inadequate to meet their needs. Advocating for sufficient funding is an opportunity for the United States to assert its international leadership in the Bali negotiations.
   We hope that you will seize this opportunity and demonstrate our deepest ideals as Americans by leading the way in securing an international commitment to adaptation funding.

325,   Senate Passes Kerry Obama Legislation to Close KBR Tax Loophole  Provide Tax Relief for Troops   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Senate Passes Kerry Obama Legislation to Close KBR Tax Loophole  Provide Tax Relief for Troops Thursday  May 22  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Whitney Smith  Kerry  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C    Senators John Kerry and Barack Obama today announced that the Senate passed the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008  The  HEART Act    The Act would provide tax relief to the men and women in our nation s armed services and others volunteering service on behalf of the United States  including Peace Corps volunteers and AmeriCorps volunteers   and is paid for by the Kerry Obama tax reform that closed the tax loophole that allowed defense contractor KBR to avoid paying its fair share of taxes  The Act passed the House yesterday and now goes to the President for his signature   Kerry and Obama were instrumental in ensuring that the funds that will be used to pay for these benefits came from defense contractors that were not paying their fair share of taxes   In March  they introduced the Fair Share Act of 2008 to close the loophole that had allowed KBR to fleece the American taxpayer by almost  100 million a year  It was discovered that KBR and another defense contractor have avoided paying their fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes    Now thousands of military families in Massachusetts will receive the benefits they deserve and big companies will pay their fair share of taxes rather than leaving hard working Americans with the bill   said Senator Kerry    This important bill will provide much needed tax relief to our brave service members and hold American companies accountable for paying taxes and guaranteeing that employees receive the benefits they are entitled to through their employment   said Senator Obama    For the sake of transparency and fairness in our tax system  we cannot allow Federal contractors to set up shell corporations in tax shelters and shirk their responsibility to pay payroll taxes for their American employees   I commend Senator Kerry for his leadership on behalf of America s small businesses  workers  and service members and I call on the President to sign this bill into law   The HEART Act includes several provisions included in legislation introduced by Kerry and Senator Gordon Smith  D Oregon  in January of 2007  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief of 2007 aimed to bolster military families and small businesses that employ reservists    The HEART Act would   Enable active duty military personnel to qualify for economic stimulus payments  The HEART Act would clarify that active military who file a joint tax return would be eligible for the stimulus rebate payment even if the spouse does not have a Social Security number   Make permanent the ability to include combat pay as earned income for purposes of the Earned Income Tax Credit  The earned income tax credit  EITC  is a refundable tax credit for eligible low income workers   Generally   earned income  includes taxable wages  salaries  tips  and other employee compensation   Some low income military families who receive the EITC based on taxable military pay could lose this tax credit if they begin receiving non taxable combat pay and have no other earned income on which to claim the EITC   The HEART Act would extend the provision that allows America s military men and women to count combat pay for the purposes of qualifying for the earned income tax credit   Make permanent and modify qualified mortgage bonds used to finance residences for veterans  To give our nation s brave veterans greater access to homeownership  the HEART Act would permanently extend the provision that allows veterans to qualify for state operated  tax exempt mortgage revenue bond programs  This program provides financing to provide lower income individuals without regard to the general first time home buyer requirement   Modify retirement plan protections for reservists who have given their lives in service or who are disabled while serving our country  The HEART Act would modify the Uniformed Services Employment and Re employment Rights Act to  1  allow the day prior to the date of death to be treated as the date the employee returned to work for purposes of triggering payment of benefits under a qualified plan  and 2  permit an employer to make certain contributions to a qualified pension plan on behalf of an employee who is killed or becomes disabled in combat   Modify treatment of differential wages paid by an employer to an employee who becomes active duty military  In the case of an employee who is called to active duty with the United States uniformed services  some employers voluntarily agree to continue paying the level of compensation that the service member would otherwise have received from the employer during the service member s period of active duty  This  differential pay  is not treated as wages for purposes of the federal income tax withholding rules that apply to an employer s payment of wages  The HEART Act would treat differential wages paid by an employer to an employee who becomes active duty military as wages for withholding and retirement plan purposes   Extend the period for filing tax refund credit claims arising from Department of Veterans Affairs  DVA  disability determinations  Because of the lapse of time between retirement and the determination of  or the onset and determination of  a service connected disability  the HEART ACT would extend the statute of limitations to permit retired military personnel to file claims for refunds one year after the date of the determination of a service connected disability is made   Make permanent the special rules that permit penalty free withdrawals from retirement plans  Generally  there is a ten percent withdrawal tax on early distributions from certain retirement plans   Because reservists called to active duty may need access to amounts that they have contributed to their retirement plans in order to meet their personal financial obligations while serving our country  the HEART Act would extend special rules that permit active duty reservists to make penalty free withdrawals from their retirement plans  and a reservist has two years from the last day of the active duty period to contribute distributions to an IRA   Permit recipients of military death benefit gratuities to roll over the amounts received to tax favored accounts for retirement and education savings  To enable survivors of servicemembers should be able to contribute death benefit proceeds to accounts to save for future retirement and education needs  the HEART Act would permit recipients of military death benefit gratuities to roll over the amounts received  tax free  to a Roth IRA or an Education Savings Account  and  Provide a tax credit for small employers with respect to differential wage payments to employees who are on active military duty  Many employers voluntarily eliminate any pay gap between the reservists  civilian pay and military pay by paying the difference  The proposal would treat the pay gap as wages requiring information reporting and subject the differential pay payments to withholding  The proposal would also make it easier for employers to contribute to their activated employee s retirement plans    The HEART Act would also permanently allow the Social Security Administration to disclose tax return information to the DVA for purposes of determining eligibility for certain veteran s programs  clarify that certain tax rebates and benefits are excludible from income for volunteer firefighters  clarify the application of the  five year requirement  to the sale of a principal residence by a Peace Corps volunteer  clarify that state payments to service members are treated as qualified military benefits  and provide for permanent exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence by certain employees of the intelligence community  Supplemental Social Security Income To ensure fairer treatment of military families who depend on Supplemental Security Income payments  the HEART Act would   Allow most military cash allowances beyond basic pay to be treated as earned income for purposes of determining Supplemental Security Income  SSI  eligibility and benefit amounts for military families  and treat certain housing payments as in kind support and maintenance   Disregard state annuity payments paid to blind  disabled  and aged veterans when determining SSI eligibility and benefits  and  Disregard allowances paid to all Americorps volunteers for the purpose of determining SSI eligibility and benefit amounts   Revenue Provisions  The HEART ACT would  revise tax rules on expatriation  American citizens and long term U S  residents are subject to tax on their worldwide income  Under current law  taxpayers can avoid taxes by renouncing their citizenship or terminating their residence  The Heart Act would tighten current law rules to ensure that certain high net worth taxpayers cannot renounce their citizenship or terminate their residence in order to avoid U S  taxes  Under this provision  high net worth individuals would be treated as if they sold all of their property for its fair market value on the day before such individual expatriates or their residency would be terminated  The gain would be recognized to the extent that the aggregate gain recognized exceeds  600 000  which will be adjusted for cost of living in the future    Modify treatment of certain foreign persons performing services under contract with United States  The Heart Act generally would treat foreign subsidiaries of American companies performing services under a U S  government contract as American employers for employment tax purposes  The domestic parent would be jointly liable for employment taxes imposed on the foreign subsidiary   Increase general failure to file return penalty  The Heart Act would increase the general penalty for failure to file tax returns to the lesser of  135 or 100 percent of the amount required to be shown on such return    Mental Health Parity  The HEART Act would extend current law excise tax for failure to comply with the mental health parity requirements for benefits for services furnished on or after the date of enactment through December 31  2008  Current law requires certain group health plans to provide the same coverage for mental health benefits that they provide for medical and surgical health benefits   The HEART Act would extend the imposition of a  100 per day excise tax on group health plans that fail to comply with this requirement                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period

1959,"SEN. SANDERS VOTES FOR BILL TO CURB EMISSIONS FROM CAPITOL POWER PLANT
  A Senate panel approved a bill to reduce pollution from the Capitol Power Plant. Built almost a century ago, the power plant generates steam and chilled water that is piped to the Capitol and nearby Senate and House office buildings for heating and air conditioning. The plant burns coal as well as natural gas and some heating oil. Sanders, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the chief sponsor of the most far-reaching bill to reverse global warming, voted for the bill to curb emissions from the Capitol Power Plant. The legislation is part of a package of ""green government"" bills that were advanced by the committee on Wednesday. 
  The power plant bill, which now goes before the full Senate, would establish a $3 million, two-year program under the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the plant. Located about four blocks south of the Capitol, the plant burned more than 17,000 tons of coal last year. In the process, according to a congressional report, about 60,000 tons of CO2, a major contributor to global warming, belched out of the smokestack.
  The committee also approved a bill that would require the federal government to take steps to encourage the building of ""green"" government buildings and upgrade existing buildings to meet the highest standards for energy efficiency, indoor air quality and other environmental impacts. Another measure that cleared committee would authorize construction of a ""solar wall"" consisting of 25,000 photovoltaic cells on the roof of the Department of Energy headquarters in Washington, DC.
  Another panel, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, earlier approved legislation by Sanders that would give grants to states and cities for innovative programs to improve the energy efficiency. That legislation is part of an energy bill that the full Senate is scheduled to take up next week. Another Sanders provision would make grants to colleges and universities for innovative energy projects.

                     Newark  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with representatives from Foodlink  along with local Wayne County growers and producers to showcase a new  low cost distribution network that will help small local farmers    including those in Wayne County   ship their produce to markets in Rochester and beyond  The   Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center    partnership was established to help small farmers in the Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes regions  who might not otherwise have access to long haul distribution networks  sell their produce beyond their local area  in upstate markets like Rochester or New York City         Foodlink Foodbank currently distributes over 8 million pounds of rescued food to 10 counties in the Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes region  Once those deliveries are completed however  their trucks often return to Rochester empty  Through the   Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center    partnership  those trucks will now be available to local growers and farmers wishing to send their produce to purchasers from restaurants  schools and other markets in Rochester and elsewhere  After delivering their food to area non profits  Foodlink will pick up locally grown produce in its 10 county service area   Once the product is at the Foodlink warehouse  the product can either by combined with other growers for a larger delivery to New York City  or can be delivered directly to regional retailers for sale to local consumers        The Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center has already begun working with area farmers including Finger Lakes Organic in Wayne County  Freshlink Farms in Monroe County  Pederson Farms and Red Jacket Orchards in Ontario County  One grower    Pederson Farms   has already reached an agreement with Foodlink to ship over half million pounds of cauliflower from Ontario County to Wegmans Stores in Rochester and to other wholesalers  The Fulfillment Center is working additional partners on both the supply side of product and the demand side for consumers who desire fresh New York State products          Some of the biggest challenges to staying economically viable that farmers cite are the lack of local markets and the poor distribution system for their farm products   it is simply too hard or impossible for them to bring their goods to market     Senator Clinton said    This is an incredible initiative that will not only help small local farmers expand their markets  but will provide consumers with the high quality  specialty foods they demand and the nutritious produce that they deserve     Senator Clinton said           It is not good stewardship to put together millions of dollars worth of assets to just do charity     asserts Foodlink  s Executive Director Tom Ferraro    As the regional food bank for 30 years  we have been combating the symptoms of hunger  while an opportunity exists to use our existing infrastructure to impact the systemic causes of poverty by supporting Upstate economic development  job creation  and ensuring New York State dollars stay in our communities           In addition to providing the distribution network through their fleet of trucks  Foodlink will also help participating growers by serving as an ordering and central distribution point with their food warehousing infrastructure  a USDA certified repackaging facility and a computerized inventory system         An initial focus group held by Foodlink in March 2005 found that area school districts and food purchasers  despite their commitment to supporting local producers  experienced considerable difficulty in buying locally grown  New York State produce  Among the identified barriers was the lack of time that food purchasers have to personally connect with multiple

           Obama Iraq Security Contractors Amendment Wins Approval in Senate Friday  September 28  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Legislation demands answers on role of contractors in Iraq WASHINGTON  D C      Last night  the United States Senate accepted an amendment to the Defense Department Authorization bill introduced by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  that will require federal departments to compile and report information to Congress on the role of private security contractors in Iraq         There are too many unanswered questions about the role of private security contractors in Iraq and it   s time for answers     Senator Obama said      The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent in Iraq and the role that security contractors are playing   This legislation will start getting the information we need to make sure their operations are going forth in a way that doesn   t hinder our military   s efforts to bring this war to a responsible end  I reiterate my calls on President Bush to immediately begin bringing these answers to Congress       Obama originally offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February   With an estimated 48 000 private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following    Specifically  Obama   s amendment will direct federal departments and agencies to report to Congress on the following within 90 days  The total number of contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan The companies awarded these contracts The total cost of the contractors And the process by which federal departments will track the number of contractors killed or wounded Within 180 days  the Department of Defense will have to submit a report to Congress on its strategy for using contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  a description of the activities being carried out by contractors  and a strategy for ensuring that contractors do not perform inherently governmental functions and that they are not supervising other U S  government personnel   Obama wrote to Secretary Rice today continuing to push for answers on the Blackwater incident and on the role of contractors in general    The text of the letter is below  September 28  2007 The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State   2201 C Street  NW   Washington  DC 20520 Dear Madam Secretary   I am writing regarding the September 16 incident in Baghdad involving the State Department s security escort  which consists of armed private contractors from the firm Blackwater USA   According to press accounts of that incident  Blackwater contractors killed at 11 Iraqis and wounded 12 others   This incident and a pattern of similar incidents described in press accounts raise larger questions about the role of private contractors in Iraq     who carry out what had once been viewed as inherently governmental functions   Tens of thousands of private security employees are operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors have died in Iraq since 2003   As the recent incident in Baghdad illustrates  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  what military and safety equipment they are provided  and what rules of engagement they are following   For this reason  I introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February   This legislation would require federal agencies to report to Congress on   the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of those contractors  the number of contractors killed or wounded  information about the military and safety equipment provided to contractors  and a description of disciplinary action taken against contractors   The legislation would improve coordination between security contractors and U S  armed forces by requiring the issuance of rules of engagement  clarify the legal status of contractors  and require investigation of criminal misconduct engaged in by contractors   The FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which is currently before the Senate  includes several provisions from S  674  and similar provisions have been included in the House version of the bill  In an effort to learn more about Blackwater s operations in Iraq  I am interested in getting your reaction to several issues under the jurisdiction of the Department of State  1   The press has reported several other instances involving Blackwater  including a reported shooting of the Iraqi Vice President s security guard inside the Green Zone on Christmas Eve 2006  reported shootings of Interior Ministry employees  and reported armed standoffs between Blackwater employees and Iraqi police   It has also been claimed by U S  officials quoted in media reports that the State Department was informed of this pattern  but failed to take action against the firm   Has the Department investigated these or other incidents   If so  what were the legal or contractual results of those investigations   2   Following the recent incident in Baghdad  the Iraqi government reportedly banned Blackwater from operating in Iraq   The resulting ban on Blackwater   s operations reportedly caused the entire U S  diplomatic effort within Iraq to cease operations  preventing State Department from even leaving the Green Zone to carry out their jobs for several days   How did the U S  government become so dependent on just one company in order to carry out its mandated missions   What reforms are being implemented to prevent such vulnerabilities for inherently governmental operations in the future   Given the obvious needs  will you be rebuilding the Department s Diplomatic Security office  or will you continue to rely on contractors in a way that could lead to similar problems and vulnerabilities in the future   3   Last year  Congress enacted and the President signed into law a provision stating that contractors operating in contingency operations would potentially fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice  UCMJ    Is it your view that any illegal actions committed by armed private contractors in Iraq would be punishable under the UCMJ  as Iraq is a contingency operation and they are civilians accompanying the force in the pursuit of that mission   If not  under what legal process would they be held accountable   How many contractors have been held accountable for past incidents over the last four years of operations in Iraq   4   It has also been reported that two former members of the Blackwater firm have pled guilty to the illegal transfer of American made weaponry to the PKK  Kurdistan Workers Party   an organization that is designated as a  foreign terrorist organization  by your own Department   What were the effects of the Turkish government s discovery of U S  weapons in a terrorist group s hands    apparently facilitated by private contractor personnel   Has this incident harmed U S  relations with our NATO ally Turkey and your wider efforts to ensure stability and democracy in the region   5   Lastly  I am concerned about the impact of this incident  as well as others since the private contractor role at Abu Ghraib  on our overall effort to win the wider  war of ideas  that is required to defeat terrorism   This recent incident and other incidents have been widely reported in the Muslim world  with negative implications for U S  efforts   The result is that not only are the private contractors being blamed  but so is the U S  government   Has the State Department conducted an analysis of the consequences of turning over such functions in a contingency operation zone to private contractors   Is this outsourcing actually hurting  rather than helping  our public diplomacy efforts  especially our efforts to win  hearts and minds    The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent and whether American civilian contractors are following applicable laws   Unfortunately  recent press accounts    particularly those alluding to the State Department s obstruction of a House investigation    suggest that the Department is not interested in a full accounting of Blackwater s actions or in ensuring adequate oversight of Blackwater and other private security contractors   The U S  government must ensure an expedited resolution to these troubling developments  I look forward to your timely responses to my inquiries   Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,1
342,   Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus Express Concerns Over Recent VA Promotion    U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus Express Concerns Over Recent VA Promotion  Wednesday  July 23  2008  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   Doctor who oversaw Marion VA facility chosen to oversee VA quality and safety WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  were joined by Congressmen Jerry Costello  D IL  and John Shimkus  R IL  in expressing concern over the recent appointment of Dr  Peter Almenoff   the former head of the regional network responsible for the Veterans Affairs  VA  Medical Center in Marion  Illinois   as the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health and for Quality Safety    In a letter to Secretary of the VA  Dr  James Peake  the members of the Illinois Congressional delegation asked for an explanation of the VA s decision to promote Dr  Almenoff along with a full description of his new responsibilities   Additionally  they asked for any information the VA may have about his efforts to ensure high quality medical care at Marion as director of the VA Heartland Network   Dr  Peter Almenoff had oversight authority over the Marion VA Medical Center when nine lives were lost due to substandard care   said Durbin    Just last week  he was given a promotion expanding his authority over healthcare throughout the VA   Critical questions about Dr  Almenoff s role in overseeing the quality of care at Marion VA should have been answered before he was appointed to this new position    After last year s unacceptable tragedies and negligent administration of the Marion VA  it s deeply troubling that Secretary Peake would promote the individual apparently responsible for the mismanagement of the facility to lead the Department s health quality and safety efforts   said Senator Obama    There are too many unanswered questions about Dr  Almenoff s role in the mismanagement of Marion that it seems imprudent to move forward with this appointment without further explanation  Our veterans and service members deserve care worthy of their sacrifice  and they should not be put in danger   I look forward to Secretary Peake s prompt explanation    We have repeatedly emphasized that the VA needs to be very clear with the public about how it is proceeding to restore confidence in the Marion VAMC and the overall veterans  health system   said Costello    Given Dr  Almenoff s previous position  we need more information as to how his promotion best serves the VA and our veterans moving forward    Many veterans have lost confidence in the Marion VA Medical Center  and their trust must be earned back   Shimkus said   Promoting someone at this time who had been in the chain of command  such as Dr  Almenoff  sends the wrong message to those who have put their lives on the line for this nation   Durbin  Obama  Costello and Shimkus have been closely monitoring the progress at the Marion VA Medical Center and the progress being made in hiring a new professional leadership team for the facility   Last month  in a meeting with the four Illinois lawmakers  Secretary Peake announced that a new leadership team will be put in place this fall at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Marion  Illinois      text of letter below and attached   July 23  2008   The Honorable James B  Peake  M D    Secretary of Veterans  Affairs  Department of Veterans  Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Peake  Last week  the Department of Veterans  Affairs announced that its quality and safety efforts will be led by an official with a questionable track record of ensuring quality and safety at a VA medical care facility in Illinois   Dr  Peter Almenoff  who will serve as the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Quality and Safety  formerly directed the VA Heartland Network responsible for the Marion VA Medical Center   As you know  at least nine veterans died in 2007 because of surgical incompetence at the Marion facility   The VA reviewed the facility after the deaths and found easily identifiable problems at Marion   We are not aware of any efforts by the network to fix these problems in the months before the spike in mortality levels   Indeed  the Department s reviews identified certain deficiencies with the network led by Dr  Almenoff  The role of the network in the failure of the Marion facility was never formally reviewed   Nor were network officials included in the Administrative Board of Investigation review   Instead  the VA has promoted the director  who should have been aware of the mismanagement at Marion    mismanagement that led to the deaths of veterans who had every right to trust that they would receive quality medical care  It is difficult to understand the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff   News of his promotion will be frustrating for the veterans who rely on the Marion medical center  particularly since quality and safety issues were at the forefront of the facility s troubles   It may also be of concern to veterans nationally  as Dr  Almenoff presumably will be responsible for quality and safety issues for the entire VA   You have promised to visit Marion and meet with concerned individuals there  and we are sure you will be asked during your visit about the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff  We would appreciate an explanation for the decision to promote Dr  Almenoff and a full description of his new responsibilities  along with any information the VA may have about his efforts as director of the Heartland Network to ensure high quality medical care at Marion  Sincerely                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic

  WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Durbin  D IL   Blanche Lincoln  D AR  and Mark Pryor  D AR  today sent a letter to United States Department of Labor  DOL  Secretary Elaine L  Chao requesting that DOL be prepared to immediately assist displaced workers if Maytag washer plants in Illinois  Arkansas and Iowa are closed    On May 10  Whirpool announced that it would be closing laundry appliance plants in Illinois  Arkansas and Iowa  The Illinois facility located in Herrin employs 1 000 people and is the backbone of the local economy    Senators Obama and Durbin said that they are extremely concerned about the potential impact on Downstate Illinois communities if the plants are closed and asked Secretary Chao immediately prepare to assist displaced workers if closings occur    We ve seen how recent plant closings in Galesburg have devastated local economies and communities in Illinois   Obama said   The Department of Labor must be prepared to immediately help Maytag workers get back on their feet if the Herrin closing goes forward      Whirlpool s decision to close the Herrin  Illinois plant is a painful loss for Southern Illinois   said Durbin   We must do everything possible so that these 1 000 employees have the help they need to find new jobs     Below  please find the full text of the letter    May 17  2006   The Honorable Elaine L  Chao  Secretary  United States Department of Labor  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20210   Dear Secretary Chao    We are writing regarding the decision of Whirlpool  Inc  to close Maytag washer and dryer plants in Illinois and Arkansas   These plant closings will have a significant impact on thousands of our constituents  and we request the immediate assistance of the Department of Labor  DOL  in helping displaced Maytag workers get back on their feet    As you know  Whirlpool announced on May 10 that it would be closing laundry appliance plants in Illinois  Arkansas  and Iowa   The Illinois facility is located in Herrin and employs 1 000 people  the Arkansas facility is located in Searcy and employs 700 people   These plants form the backbone of their respective communities  and the loss of these 1 700 jobs will be felt deeply by families across each of our states    We understand that state officials and community leaders are attempting to stop or mitigate these plant closings   However  we want to make sure that if the closings go forward  the 1 700 individuals in Illinois and Arkansas who will lose their jobs will have immediate access to the full range of DOL programs and services     Specifically  we request that the Department immediately mobilize resources through the DOL Rapid Response program to begin working with state and local workforce development agencies and local One Stop Career Centers to help Maytag employees transition into new jobs   These workers will require   career counseling and job search assistance  information about unemployment insurance  opportunities for education and training  and information about their health benefits and pensions options   We understand that Rapid Response specialists have a unique ability to provide this training  and we request that these specialists be mobilized immediately to help displaced Maytag workers    Further  we understand that Illinois and Arkansas may apply for Department of Labor National Emergency Grants to expand their capacity to respond to this crisis   We fully support and urge the Department s approval of any such application  as these layoffs significantly exceed the minimum criteria for National Emergency Grant assistance      Finally  we expect that many of our dislocated constituents will apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance   Competition from foreign imports may have played a central role in the loss of these 1 700 jobs   We hope the Department will consider certifying these displaced workers as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance  which will help them return to suitable employment as quickly as possible    We appreciate your timely consideration of these requests   These plant closings will devastate our constituents in Herrin and Searcy  and

1945,"SEN. SANDERS: IRAQ HAS NOT MET BENCHMARKS
  Violence in Iraq ""remains high"" eight months after President Bush began his surge, nonpartisan congressional researchers reported on Tuesday. The Government Accountability Office found that Iraq has failed to meet 11 of 18 security and economic benchmarks set by Congress and agreed on by the president. ""This report is the latest evidence that it is time for the Bush administration to acknowledge that the Iraq war was a huge mistake,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders. 
   ""The [Iraqi] government has not eliminated militia control of local security, eliminated political intervention in military operations, ensured even-handed enforcement of the law, increased army units capable of independent operations, and ensured that political authorities made no false accusations against security forces,"" the report said.
   ""It is unclear whether sectarian violence in Iraq has decreased,"" the GAO added. The fact remains, however, that ""average daily attacks against civilians have remained unchanged from February to July.""
   The report was somewhat less critical of progress in Iraq than an earlier draft. News accounts said the final product was toned down due to Pentagon objections. 
   In the coming days, reports on Iraq from the White House and the Pentagon are expected to portray a much rosier picture. ""The administration,"" as Paul Krugman observed in The New York Times, ""has had remarkable success creating the perception that the 'surge' is succeeding, even though there's not a shred of verifiable evidence to suggest that it is.""

Long Island    Schumer Called Office of Science Director Orbach Yesterday Seeking Funding Assurances for Programs     Delegation Pledges to Continue to Fight for Full Funding for National Synchotron Light Source II Washington  DC   Following this week  s announcement that the Department of Energy  s Office of Science will receive a  200 million increase for the FY 2007 from its FY 2006 funding level  yesterday  DOE Office of Science Director Raymond Orbach assured Senators Schumer and Clinton and Congressman Bishop that the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  program will be fully funded for FY 2007 and the National Synchotron Light Source II  NSLS II  program will be significantly funded for FY 2007  Orbach  s assurance is a huge victory for Brookhaven National Labs which was girding itself for devastating budget cuts          On Tuesday  Senator Schumer sent a letter to the Office of Science urging it to use its increased budget to fully fund RHIC and NSLS II  Yesterday  Schumer followed up with a phone call to Director Orbach and secured assurances that RHIC would be fully funded and NSLS II would be significantly funded for FY 2007             I  m thrilled that Director Orbach responded so quickly to our request  and that he understands the huge impact Brookhaven  s programs have on our nation  s scientific research and Long Island  s high tech job market     said Senator Schumer    Continued funding for these two cutting edge programs will help ensure that American science remains a global leader               This is a tremendous victory for science and for Long Island     Senator Clinton said    This has been a long fight but I am pleased that the Administration is going to do the right thing for Brookhaven National Lab in this Budget  These much needed funds are absolutely critical to Brookhaven Lab  s continuing scientific research  This announcement not only recognizes the importance of the lab  s research  but is an investment in Long Island  s continued involvement in cutting edge scientific research and development              Full federal funding for the RHIC is good for Long Island and will help secure America s competitive edge in scientific research   Bishop  who also spoke personally with Orbach to confirm that the Office of Science will fully fund the project  said    Advancing this research will also preserve hundreds of jobs held by BNL s highly skilled and dedicated employees   But I also recognize that our scientific community cannot thrive in this unpredictable funding environment   I will work with my colleagues to make sure that as we go forward  we meet the needs of the scientific community and BNL           Yesterday  the Continuing Resolution  CR  passed the House with an increase in funding for the DOE  s Office of Science at  3 796 393 000  an increase of approximately  200 million from FY   06  The FY06 budget for the Department of Energy cut funding for RHIC  Because only 2 of the 11 Appropriations bills were signed into law last year  Appropriators set funding for most federal agencies at the FY06 funding level in the FY07 Continuing Resolution  It  s is expected that the Continuing Resolution will pass the Senate by mid February           Schumer  Clinton and Bishop also pledged to continue fighting for full funding for NSLS II  a new state of the art electron storage ring designed to deliver world leading intensity and brightness  It will produce broad and practical impacts on a wide range of initiatives in nanotechnology  biomedicine  and clean and affordable energy  The funds for design and development for NSLS II would be administered by BNL         The RHIC is a 2 4 mile superconductor that accelerates gold ions to nearly the speed of light and causes collisions that recreate the   Big Bang    offering a glimpse into the birth of the universe during its first few microseconds           Schumer  Clinton and Bishop have been longtime champions for Brookhaven  securing millions to support the lab  s work along with being the leading public official in the accelerated cleanup effort  Schumer helped restore operations funding for the BNL  s major facilities  RHIC  Light Source  and the medical imaging program  These cuts  if allowed  would have been devastating to BNL  The Senator was an early supporter  and continues to be an avid proponent

Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   Senator Clinton again called on her colleagues to reconsider this proposal   Senator Clinton underscored the need to restore FEMA to a Cabinet level  independent agency that has a qualified Director who reports directly to the President of the United States   In a letter to Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT   Senator Clinton emphasized that eliminating FEMA and moving its responsibilities within the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  would only increase bureaucratic obstacles in our federal government  s ability to prepare for and to respond to disasters in an effective manner   Senator Clinton  along with Senator Trent Lott  R MS   has sponsored legislation to return FEMA to its status under the Clinton Administration            I believe that the lesson learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is that DHS is ill equipped to oversee FEMA and its responsibilities and that consolidating these duties within an independent FEMA is the best way to ensure the efficient and effective handling our federal disaster efforts   It is why I have sponsored legislation restoring FEMA  s independence  and why I hope that you will reconsider your recommendation to dismantle and to reassign its duties within DHS     Senator Clinton wrote          The text of Senator Clinton  s letter to Senators Collins and Lieberman follows

                The Honorable Joseph I  Lieberman  Ranking Member  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  SH 601  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510      Dear Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman       I write to express again my opinion that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  should be reestablished as an independent agency and its Director restored to a Cabinet level position   I was disappointed to learn that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is prepared to recommend that FEMA be abolished and its responsibilities distributed under a new structure within the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    I believe that the lesson learned from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is that DHS is ill equipped to oversee FEMA and its responsibilities and that consolidating these duties within an independent FEMA is the best way to ensure the efficient and effective handling our federal disaster efforts   It is why I have sponsored legislation restoring FEMA  s independence  and why I hope that you will reconsider your recommendation to dismantle and to reassign its duties within DHS          As recent events have shown  FEMA should not have been moved from an independent  Cabinet level agency to a sub agency of DHS   What we have learned is that FEMA  s mission    to focus on preparedness  response  recovery and mitigation of disasters    was lost in the growing and expansive bureaucratic structure of the newly formed DHS   The flawed responses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita proved that adding this layer of administration hindered not only the preparation and recovery on the federal level  but also impeded communications between federal  state and local government agencies responsible for disaster preparedness and response   These barriers to effective communication need to be eliminated          For these same reasons  I believe the FEMA Director should report directly to the President and should have full authority to coordinate with all agencies and to take whatever executive action is necessary to ensure needed resources and recovery personnel are deployed to impacted areas in an efficient and timely manner   Restoring these direct lines of communication will make FEMA more effective and will help restore the public  s confidence in the federal government  s ability to prepare for and respond to natural and manmade catastrophes            Finally  restoring our citizens   confidence in our federal government  s ability to handle disasters requires the appointment of qualified people with the requisite emergency services experience to lead our disaster efforts   The Director and Deputy Director must be people whose professional qualifications make them right for the difficult job of coordinating our disaster preparation and response             I urge you to reconsider your recommendation to abolish FEMA and to redistribute its responsibilities within the Department of Homeland Security   As recent  tragic events have shown  the current bureaucratic model hinders our ability to effectively and efficiently prepare and respond to disasters           Thank you for your consideration           Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0

Contact  Ben LaBolt  202  228 5511 Legislation Would Increase Fuel Economy Standards for First Time in over 20 Years WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Arlen Specter  R PA   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   and Norm Coleman  R MN  today reintroduced legislation that would reduce U S  gasoline consumption by nearly half a trillion gallons by 2028 and greatly decrease our dependence on foreign oil      Setting America on a course towards energy independence will bolster our security  insulate our economy  and keep our environment livable     said Senator Obama      Now that President Bush agrees it is time to raise fuel economy standards  Congress must act to decrease our gasoline consumption and invest in the alternative fuels of the future          Energy is fundamentally reshaping the power balance in the world  largely to the detriment of the United States   The hundreds of billions of dollars spent on oil imports each year weakens the U S  economy  enriches hostile regimes  and is used by some to support terrorism   It is incomprehensible that fuel economy has been stagnant when the costs of oil dependence are so high   The 110th Congress must reform fuel economy standards as part of a comprehensive energy strategy that is in the interest of U S  national security     said Senator Lugar  Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee       If it was not clear before  it is now   domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy     said Senator Joseph R  Biden  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee     For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can   t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks          Consumers are demanding fuel efficient vehicles and I believe American ingenuity is up to the task     Senator Smith said      The proper mix of fuel economy standards and tax incentives can help auto manufactures roll out a durable and safe car  truck  or SUV   This is also a national security issue   We can   t keep buying oil from countries that use the profits to shoot bullets back at us            I am pleased to join my colleagues in again cosponsoring legislation that will improve vehicle fuel economy     Senator Specter said      This legislation will help the United States reduce our dependence on foreign oil and act as a responsible environmental steward by reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions          Improving vehicle fuel efficiency is an important step in helping reduce our country   s dependency on foreign oil   It   s time to investigate serious ways to improve fuel efficiency  and I believe this bill is a great start     Senator Bingaman  chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  said       Our addiction to foreign oil is a threat to both our economic and national security     said Senator Coleman     It   s time we take the decisions about our energy supply out of the hands of foreign nations  By coupling a sensible fuel efficiency standard that will push technology to the marketplace with strong tax incentives  we can put American on the road to energy independence      America spends  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually  on its 20 million barrel a day oil habit  Passenger vehicles alone burn 8 million gallons of oil each day  Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue  As oil prices have exceeded  70 a barrel in recent years and with total U S  petroleum use estimated to increase 23 percent over the next 20 years  we must act now to prevent a future energy crisis  But while it   s clear that increasing fuel economy standards is a crucial part of any effort to reduce our consumption of foreign oil  efforts to raise them have been stalled for 20 years   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of 4 percent     roughly one mile per gallon     each year   The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   The Fuel Economy Reform Act reflects the recommended approach of the Energy Security Leadership Council   s 2006 report on how to secure America   s energy future   This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised     In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year   If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  that means consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028   The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars   This Congress provides a window of opportunity to achieve fuel economy reform   President Bush signaled his commitment to lowering oil consumption  in part through fuel economy reform  in this year   s State of the Union Address   In December 2006  the Energy Security Leadership Council noted the Fuel Economy Reform Act as their recommended approach to secure America   s energy future       We need to act now if we want to prevent an even greater energy crisis in the future     said Obama     This bipartisan  common sense approach will finally harness the technology we already have to save Americans money at the pump and save America from a dependence on the world   s most unstable  undemocratic regimes          The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 A New Approach to Increasing CAFE Standards  A New Approach   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2007 seeks to break the logjam on establishing greater vehicle fuel economy by establishing a targeted 4 percent increase each year in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards   a rate that the National Academy of Sciences has determined is possible   unless the experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  justify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is technologically unachievable  cannot maintain overall fleet safety  or is not cost effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   Higher CAFE Standards   If the 4 percent per year target is met for ten years after the continuous provision improvements go into effect  this bill will save 1 3 million barrels of oil per day and 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year   If gasoline is just  2 50 per gallon  consumers will save  50 billion at the pump in 2018 alone  By 2028  Americans will have saved a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline and cut global warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases    Flexibility for Manufacturers  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also provides fairness and flexibility to domestic auto makers by establishing different standards for different types of cars   Currently manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars   The bill creates further flexibility by giving NHTSA the authority to allow companies to earn credit for improving fuel efficiency beyond the CAFE standard in one type of car  and using those credits to meet goals for other vehicle models   Because technological advances may affect manufacturers over time  the bill instructs the Energy Department  Environmental Protection Agency  and National Academy of Sciences  to study ways to reform the regulatory structure of this approach in 2016    Incentives for Fuel Economy  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced technology vehicles  this legislation provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants   This will strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles   The bill would lift the current 60 000 per manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more Americans to buy ultra efficient vehicles   The Problem    America is Addicted to Foreign Oil   America   s 20 million barrel a day habit costs our economy  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually   We use 8 million barrels of oil each day on passenger vehicles   Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue   Oil recently has reached as high as  75 a barrel and  3 00 a gallon at the pump  during the next 20 years total US petroleum demand will increase 23 percent   CAFE   Initial Success Followed by 20 Years of Little Progress   In response to the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s  Congress enacted CAFE standards  the first ever requirements for gas mileage   NHTSA raised the average gas mileage of cars and trucks from just over 14 miles per gallon  mpg  in 1976 to 27 5 mpg for cars and 20 7 mpg for trucks by 1985   By enacting these standards  the country saves approximately 3 million barrels of oil per day  making it the most successful energy saving measure ever adopted   Unfortunately  since 1985 the NHTSA has been largely unable to increase standards   The CAFE standard for cars has remained frozen at 27 5 mpg for 20 years   The standard for trucks only increased by 2 mpg to 22 2 mpg for 2007   Over those 20 years  the auto industry has developed numerous innovations  which allowed fuel economy standards to rise to 45 miles per gallon in Japan   Congressional Deadlock   Since 1985  Congress has considered numerous bills to increase fuel efficiency  without significant gains in CAFE standards   Recently  there has been a logjam between those who want Congress to mandate specific increases in CAFE standards  and those who want the rate of improvement to be determined by NHTSA   This approach ensures a rate of improvement of 4 percent annually and allows NHTSA to adjust that rate

Washington works     Feingold said      Without provisions like a strong lobbyist gift ban  and tough restrictions on privately funded travel and corporate jet flights  the bill won   t do enough to change the status quo in Washington          Last November  the American people sent a message to Washington to clean up its act  so it   s important that Congress take tough action on lobbying and ethics reform     said Senator Obama      Since donors are now limited in the amount of money they can contribute to candidates  the greatest measure of influence is how much an individual raises   The final ethics bill must require that candidates disclose those who have bundled contributions for their campaigns  so that we can expose the link between lobbyists who are raising campaign cash in exchange for votes on legislation and start changing the way Washington works        The text of the letter reads     June 21  2007 The Honorable Harry Reid  Majority Leader  The Honorable Mitch McConnell  Minority Leader The Honorable Dianne Feinstein  Chairman  Committee on Rules and Administration  The Honorable Robert Bennett  Ranking Member  Committee on Rules and Administration The Honorable Joseph Lieberman  Chairman  Committee on Homeland Security   Government Affairs  The Honorable Susan Collins  Ranking Member  Committee on Homeland Security   Government Affairs Dear Senators Reid  McConnell  Feinstein  Bennett  Lieberman  and Collins   At the beginning of the 110th Congress  the Senate worked diligently in a bipartisan fashion to pass a strong lobbying and ethics reform bill aimed at changing the culture of political Washington   That bill  known as S  1  included several provisions that we view as vital   We urge you to ensure that the Senate conferees on S  1 champion these Senate passed provisions and seek to include them in the final bill brought back to the Senate floor   In particular  we believe that the following provisions must be included in the final bill if the Congress is to fulfill its promise to deliver to the American people a lobbying and ethics reform measure that constitutes real reform and will lead to real change   A strong lobbyist gift ban     The Senate bill includes a modification to the Senate Rules to prohibit lobbyists and organizations that employ or retain lobbyists from giving gifts  including free meals and tickets  to members of Congress and their staffs   This provision must not be weakened   Restrictions on corporate jet flights     The Senate bill requires Senators to pay the charter rate when flying on corporate jets for personal  campaign  or official purposes   All components of this provision must be retained   The changes to the Federal Election Campaign Act included in the Senate bill  but not the House bill  are essential so that incumbents and challengers in congressional races are treated equally   Disclosure of political contributions and bundling by lobbyists     With gifts banned  the Senate bill requires disclosure of the various ways that lobbyists can legally provide financial assistance to elected officials   This includes contributions to campaign committees  lawmaker   s charities or entities designated by a lawmaker  Presidential libraries  inaugural committees  and events to honor or educate elected officials   To make sure the public has a complete picture of the financial ties between legislators and lobbyists  the provision requiring disclosure of participation in fundraising events and of contributions collected or arranged for lawmakers must also be included   Revolving door amendments     Current revolving door restrictions have proven ineffective in preventing members of Congress from profiting on their public service and gaining undue lobbying access to their former colleagues   The Senate bill increases the    cooling off period    for members of Congress from one year to two years    By contrast  the House bill does not change the current cooling off period    The Senate bill also expands the activities that former members must refrain from during that period   Finally  senior staff are prohibited for one year from making lobbying contacts with the entire house of Congress for which they worked  instead of just the employing office   All three of these components are important to restoring public confidence in Congress and should be included in the conference report   Limits on privately funded travel     Following the lead of the House  which significantly changed its travel rules in January  the Senate bill includes provisions designed to ensure that lobbyists and organizations that employ lobbyists do not pay for multi day trips that the public often sees as boondoggles   The Senate bill permits legitimate educational trips paid for by groups that do not lobby and one day trips to give speeches or attend events related to official business   Elaborate trips were central to the Jack Abramoff scandal  and these new rules must not be weakened in conference   Lavish convention parties     The Senate bill contains a rule change that prohibits Senators from attending events held in their honor and paid for by lobbyists or entities that employ or retain lobbyists at the national party conventions   These events have come to symbolize both the excess and the access of some lobbyist lawmaker relationships   This provision should be included in the conference report   Greater transparency in the legislative process     The Senate bill contains a number of provisions to open the legislative process to greater public scrutiny and understanding  including ending the practice of secret Senate holds  making conference reports available on the Internet at least 48 hours before voting on them  providing a 60 vote point of order against conference report items outside the scope of the conference  prohibiting    dead of night    additions to conference reports  and earmark reforms   These provisions must be retained in the final bill   We believe that a strong lobbying and ethics reform bill can help change the way politics is conducted and policy is pursued in Washington  thereby increasing public confidence in Congress   The Senate   s work in January gave the public hope that real reform could actually occur on a bipartisan basis   We strongly urge you to make sure that those hopes aren   t dashed in this last stage of the legislative process   We look forward to working with you to pass a final bill of which the Senate  and the public  can be proud   Sincerely     Russ Feingold

1778,"SEN. SANDERS ANNOUNCES GLOBAL WARMING PRINCIPLES
  As a key Senate committee prepares to take up legislation to reverse global warming, Senators Bernie Sanders and Frank Lautenberg set down a set of principles that will guide their consideration of legislation. Sanders and Lautenberg both serve on a subcommittee that will consider legislation expected to be formally introduced on Thursday by Senator Joseph Lieberman, the subcommittee chairman, and Senator John Warner, the panel's ranking Republican. ""We need to work together to address the most significant environmental threat to our planet, but this is no time for timidity. Dealing with scientific reality is more important than cutting deals,"" Sanders said. ""The latest evidence is that the scientists have underestimated the problem of global warming. The consequences of climate change are occurring sooner than expected. We must act boldly if we are to prevent planetary catastrophe."" Lautenberg said, ""Global warming is the most serious environmental problem we face. It is time to boldly and aggressively tackle global warming, and to do so quickly. To protect our families and our planet, we need to drastically reduce emissions and these principles provide the framework to do just that.""
   Here are the Sanders-Lautenberg principles: 
   * The Solution Must Recognize the Gravity of the Problem The scientific evidence is clear that humanity is responsible for global warming. As such, any action we take to prevent it must be bold, aggressive, and comprehensive enough to prevent the devastating effects of catastrophic climate change. Targets must be set to ensure that the global concentration of greenhouse gases rises to no more than 450 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent. This requires a strong 2020 target to get the country shifted to a low-carbon economy and to make the long-term reductions that are needed in the fight against global warming. Additionally, we must ensure that the latest science is continually considered and informs our ongoing action. 
   * Quickly Transition to Polluter Pays We must quickly transition to a polluter-pays scheme, and an auction is the most economically efficient and fair way to do so. Auctioning allowances will provide the incentive for companies to develop and deploy cutting-edge, low-carbon technologies. Additionally, the increased revenues from a full auction will undoubtedly help to provide relief to all those affected by global warming, help support our transition to a low-carbon economy, and to fund a significant increase in the country's use of renewable and energy efficiency technologies, including solar and wind. 
   * Encourage State Leadership The federal government should set the floor, not the ceiling, for action on and innovation in addressing global warming - consistent with the Clean Air Act and other major environmental laws. Over the past few years, states have stepped in to fill the unfortunate void left by a lack of federal leadership on global warming. As we now work to catch up, states must be able to continue to provide leadership and be able to pursue innovative strategies to protect their citizens from the risks of global warming. 
   * Additional Policies to Include in a Cap and Trade Bill While a cap and trade bill sets the basis for the mandatory emission reductions that are needed throughout the country, additional policies are needed to ensure the rapid and often cheaper deployment of clean energy technologies. Examples of such policies include green building standards, which will reduce long-term energy costs for the occupants of the property, a requirement that any new coal plant deploy carbon capture and storage technology, and policies that offer a roadmap for reduced carbon transportation fuels. 
   * Flexibility Mechanisms Must Not Result in Illusory Emission Reductions While theoretically offsets yield the same global warming benefit for less cost, in reality it is difficult, and some believe impossible, to ensure their long-term environmental integrity. As a result, the use of offsets should be strictly limited. In addition, they must be real, verifiable, additional, permanent and enforceable and should not undermine the signals to industry for technology development and deployment.

1844,"THE WEEK IN REVIEW
  As prices for home heating fuel soared, a group of senators from New England states and elsewhere urged the president to release funds for home-heating assistance. The adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard joined Senator Sanders to announce a $3 million expansion of a program to reach out to GIs returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. A Verizon Wireless bid to monopolize cell phone service in Vermont drew more scrutiny. The saga of safety concerns at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant continued. The senator took his concerns straight to the top of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. With the Senate out of session, Sanders traveled across Vermont and has set more ""listening sessions"" for the week ahead. 
   Home Heating Assistance Senator Sanders was among 32 senators who wrote to President Bush urging him to release $20 million to help people with low incomes afford to heat their homes. The Energy Information Administration has estimated that households will pay up to 22 percent more for heating fuel this winter than they paid one year ago. ""With gasoline and home heating oil already over $3 a gallon, it could be a long and financially painful winter for Vermonters,"" the Rutland Herald reported. To read the article, click here. 
   Vermont Yankee ""The Nuclear Regulatory Commission lowered its safety rating for the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant last year after the facility mistakenly sent a piece of machinery with abnormally high radiation readings to a Pennsylvania plant,"" The Burlington Free Press reported. Sanders said the report ""only heightens anxiety that Vermont Yankee suffers from safety defects."" He renewed his call for an independent safety inspection of the plant in Vernon. To read The Burlington Free Press article, click here.
   Hold the (Cell )Phone The Department of Homeland Security asked the Federal Communications Commission to hold off on a bid by Verizon Wireless to acquire Unicel. So did the Department of Justice and FBI. The State of Vermont also followed the lead of Sanders, the Vermont Public Interest Research Group and the Champlain Chamber of Commerce. ""In my view, unless strong conditions are spelled out in advance to protect Vermont consumers and businesses, this agreement should not be approved. Otherwise, Vermonters would continue to experience unreliable cell phone service,"" Sanders said. The FCC also heard from individual Vermonters. ""Year in and year out, I keep hoping that wireless service will improve. The proposed deal decreases my hopes,"" wrote a cell phone customer in Underhill. To read more of what Vermonters have told he FCC, go here and click on the comments.
   Vermont Veterans Sanders on Monday announced new federal funding that will enhance the Vermont program aimed at helping returning GIs get help. A Department of Defense appropriations bill contains $3 million for expanding the Vermont National Guard outreach program and $3 million in seed money to spread the successful project to other states. ""This is a hugely important issue, because we are seeing a staggering number of people coming home with PTSD and traumatic brain injury,"" Sanders told The Associated Press. To read more, click here .
   Climate Change A new United Nations report makes the case, more forcefully than ever before, that reductions in greenhouse gases are needed to avert a global climate catastrophe. ""The scientists are now telling us the situation is worse than they previously thought. It is incumbent upon Congress to pass bold and aggressive legislation or the planet is going to suffer severe and irreversible harm,"" Sanders said.
   Vermont Listening Sessions In a visit to Rutland High School on Monday, Sanders told students at the Stafford Technical Center that Congress finally passed legislation to make college more affordable. ""Quite frankly, it's the best higher education legislation that's been passed in decades,"" he said. It was one of several stops around Vermont during the two-week Senate break. Coming up are town meetings on Tuesday in Burlington to discuss the future of the controversial No Child Left Behind Act, a listening sessions in Wednesday in Montpelier and on Sunday in Rutland and Vergennes.

1913,"HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE IN THE STIMULUS PACKAGE
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement today at a event with home heating assistance advocates on the Capitol grounds:
   ""The price of energy is skyrocketing. People in my State of Vermont and all over this country are paying record prices to heat their homes this winter. In the richest country on the face of the earth, we must ensure that no one goes cold this winter. In the United States of America, no American should be forced to make the unacceptable choice between heating their homes and paying for their prescription drugs or putting food on the table. We must not let that happen. 
   ""For my part, I have been very active on this issue. In early December, I introduced the Keeping Americans Warm Act to provide an additional $1 billion in LIHEAP funding with 27 bi-partisan co-sponsors.
   ""I have also introduced several amendments to increase LIHEAP funding both this month and last.
   ""At a time when home heating prices are going through the roof, and it is getting colder and colder every day, increased LIHEAP funding would provide immediate real relief to millions of senior citizens on fixed incomes; low-income families with children; and persons with disabilities. 
   ""According, to the latest statistics from the Energy Information Administration, it will cost the average heating oil consumer over $2,000 to heat their homes this winter, an increase of more than 37 percent from last year. Even worse, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects that in some parts of the Northeast, heating oil consumers will pay more than $3,000 to heat their homes over the course of this winter. 
   ""The spike in energy costs is completely eviscerating the purchasing power of this extremely important program in state after state. If Congress does not act soon to confront this problem head-on, I fear for the public health and safety of millions of our most vulnerable Americans.
   ""In some parts of Vermont, it has been reported that consumers are paying as much as $3.70 a gallon for heating oil and up to $3.99 a gallon for propane. To put this in perspective, just four years ago, the price for heating oil was only $1.50 a gallon, and propane prices were even lower.
   ""These outrageously high home heating costs are pushing Vermont families into homelessness. In fact, it is not uncommon for families with two working parents to receive help from homeless shelters in my state because they can't afford anyplace else to live this winter.
   ""It will not be easy to include increased LIHEAP funding into the economic stimulus bill. But, it's not our job to do what's easy. Our job is to do what is right. Not only is including LIHEAP in the economic stimulus package the right thing to do, it is the moral thing to do. We have got to get this done.""
   Thirty-five U.S. Senators recently made a bi-partisan request to congressional leadership to add $3.62 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to the economic stimulus package. The increase would fully fund the LIHEAP program at $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2008 and provide an additional $500 million in contingency funds.
   At today's event, Senator Sanders joined Senators Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.), Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), and Bob Casey (D-Pa) at the event in the Senate swamp with community leaders and LIHEAP advocates.

1720,"SEN. SANDERS: NO CONFIDENCE IN ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  ""It is the sense of the Senate that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales no longer holds the confidence of the Senate and of the American people,"" reads a rare resolution of rebuke. ""I can tell you that this senator has no confidence in Mr. Gonzales,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, a cosponsor of the resolution, told nationally syndicated radio host Bill Press in a Monday morning interview. ""On issue after issue, he has shown disrespect for the Constitution of the United States.""  
   Sanders said ""the final straw"" was a political purge of federal prosecutors pushed out of their positions because they were considered insufficiently devoted to using the immense power of the United States Attorneys offices to pursue a political agenda driven by the Bush White House. 
   Even before the firings, widespread abuses of wiretapping authority had caused serious concerns about Gonzales performance from senators of both major political parties.
   Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose panel held hearings on the dismissals of prosecutors, has said he lost confidence in the attorney general. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the top ranking Republican on Leahy's committee, also was in the column of senators supporting the no-confidence resolution. President Bush has said he will ignore the growing unrest over his attorney general, and his loyalists in the Senate were poised to use parliamentary tactics to block a final vote on the resolution.

a meeting with Secretary Bodman to discuss the critical need for this funding                RHIC is a vital  world class nuclear physics facility used by over 1 000 users and more than 200 students at the undergraduate  masters  and doctoral levels   RHIC provides the resources for breakthrough science  and we are concerned that the funding shortfall will paralyze the momentum of Brookhaven Lab   Over  1 billion has been invested to date in Brookhaven on this project   We must not allow for any further disinvestment of federal spending in such a national treasure   the members of Congress wrote in their letter            Their letter to Secretary Bodman follows their meeting last week with the Energy Department s chief science officer  Dr  Raymond Orbach  to request a reprogramming of  20 million in funding from within the Office of Science budget for RHIC operations in FY 2006   Dr  Orbach agreed with the members of Congress that the RHIC is an integral part of the country s scientific infrastructure and shared his support for ongoing initiatives at Brookhaven   However  the Science Director was unable to provide assurance that any funding was available within the science portion of the Energy Department budget   The members are urging Secretary Bodman to find funding within his  24 billion budget to restore the  20 million that is necessary to pay for the RHIC s operation for FY 2006           The following is the text of their letter to Secretary Bodman           The Honorable Samuel Bodman  Secretary  United States Department of Energy  1000 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20585          Dear Mr  Secretary           We write concerning an issue of grave importance facing Brookhaven National Laboratory located on Long Island  New York   As you know  the Department of Energy s FY 2006 budget request to Congress resulted in a negative impact upon operating time for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  at Brookhaven    The Nuclear Physics program does not have sufficient resources to operate RHIC  and that will compromise our nation s competitive edge             We worked to make sure that the Senate provided  419 7 million for nuclear physics  an increase of  49 million over the President s budget   Additionally  the House of Representatives provided  408 3 million for nuclear physics  an increase of  37 6 million above the President s budget with specific language to restore operating time for the RHIC   Unfortunately  additional funding did not remain in the final FY 2006 Energy   Water Appropriations bill   Consequently  this funding level means the amount available in fiscal year 2006 will reduce RHIC operations from 31 weeks to only 5 6 weeks            RHIC is a vital  world class nuclear physics facility used by over 1 000 users and more than 200 students at the undergraduate  masters  and doctoral levels   RHIC provides the resources for breakthrough science  and we are concerned that the

budget for RHIC operations in FY 2006 and were informed that such a reallocation is not possible   We now request your assistance in reprogramming funds from within the overall Department of Energy appropriation for the current fiscal year   In addition  we request that you grant Brookhaven National Lab whatever authority it needs to reprogram funds for RHIC operations   Furthermore  we would like to request a meeting with you to discuss this important matter   We are dedicated to ensuring Brookhaven s lasting viability in the future and we stand ready to do whatever we can to ensure Brookhaven s future is one of growth             Sincerely      Hillary Rodham Clinton                                        United States Senate                     Charles E  Schumer  United States

                Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the U S  Senate approved an Amendment to the FY 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill that she sponsored  requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a nationwide assessment of the potential threat that cities  states  and key infrastructure face from the theft or misuse of general aviation aircraft by criminals or terrorists   Senators Durbin  IL   Lautenberg  NJ   Corzine  NJ   Schumer  NY   and Lieberman  CT  co sponsored the Amendment          The Senator  s legislation  which was offered as an Amendment to the Senate  s Homeland Security Bill  would require the government to undertake an assessment of the dangers posed to high risk  large populations and critical infrastructure areas  should general aviation aircraft be stolen and used as a weapon  The study would also require an assessment of the vulnerabilities of general aviation airports and aircraft and what low cost  high technology devices could be available to better track general aviation aircraft            I believe that this kind of national assessment is absolutely necessary to avoid a repeat of the type of attack carried out on September 11  2001 or some sinister copycat of it     Senator Clinton said    We must not turn away from the challenge of assessing threats posed by thefts or hijackings of general aviation aircraft             Last month  an intoxicated individual stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from an airport in Danbury  CT  eventually landing at the Westchester County Airport  located just to the east of the Indian Point nuclear facility            Thankfully  the Danbury incident ended without any damage  destruction or death  But it stands as a forewarning of the types of threats to which we remain vulnerable     Senator Clinton said    Our nuclear plants  key infrastructure  military bases  not to mention our large cities  could be threatened and all of the advances we have made in the area of homeland security could be subverted if general aviation airports can be breached this easily and the airplanes used as weapons             It is estimated that there are more than 19 000 landing facilities nationwide  including heliports  lakes  and dirt landing strips from which aircraft could be launched and more than 200 000 general aviation aircraft in the United States          In its report  the 9 11 Commission concluded that     M ajor vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security   These  together with inadequate screening and access controls  continue to present aviation security challenges     The report also said that part of the failure of the U S  government  s ability to thwart the September 11th terrorist attacks using airplanes was  in part  due to a lack of imagination about new and emerging threats in the bureaucracy          In May 2004 the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  issued their   Security Guidelines for General Aviation Airports     in which they outlined some guidelines general aviation airports should follow in order to secure aircraft and airfields  However  the same report also stated that    A s vulnerabilities within other areas of aviation have been reduced  General Aviation may be perceived as a more attractive target and consequently more vulnerable to misuse by terrorists             Specifically  Senator Clinton  s Amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Security  in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation  to conduct a threat assessment posed by security breaches at general aviation airports and what threats our high population areas  nuclear facilities  key infrastructure  military bases and transportation infrastructure face from stolen or hijacked general aviation aircraft if used as a weapon or loaded with explosives by terrorists  It requires the Department of Homeland Security to asses low cost technologies to track general aviation aircraft  the feasibility of implementing additional security measures and background checks  an analysis of airports with unmanned air traffic control towers  and what costs may be associated with implementing additional security measures  The amendment does not mandate new costs for general aviation rather it requires the TSA to study the vulnerabilities and report to Congress its findings within 120 days            I respect and admire the work being done by the general aviation fixed base operators  pilots  owners  airport

202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 17  2006  Obama Criticizes White House Plan to Cut Benefits to Nuclear Weapons Workers   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to President Bush expressing his deep concern about press reports indicating that the White House is planning to cut benefits to men and women who developed cancer and other serious illnesses while helping the United States develop nuclear weapons during the cold war    The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  was enacted in 2000 to provide compensation and medical benefits to employees who worked at certain Department of Energy facilities and nuclear weapons plants  including contractors  subcontractors  and some vendors  Under the EEOICPA  workers who suffer from certain radiation induced cancers and diseases are eligible to receive  150 000 plus coverage of medical expenses    According to press accounts  the White House will be leading an interagency working group to develop ways  to contain growth in the costs of the benefits  of this compensation program  This interagency working group will also discuss whether  administration clearance  should be required before groups of workers are deemed eligible for compensation    In his letter to the President  Obama wrote   If these press reports are true  the White House s plan demonstrates a startling lack of compassion for workers who sacrificed their health to provide for our national security  The Administration should be doing more to help these workers  not trying to make it more difficult for them to receive the benefits that they deserve     Workers at 17 former Illinois nuclear weapons plants qualify under the EEOICPA   However  Obama said that statistics from three of these plants demonstrate the difficulty in obtaining compensation  General Steel Industries plant in Granite City   408 cases have been filed  1 has been paid   Dow Chemical plant in Madison   164 cases have been filed  2 have been paid  Blockson Chemical plant in Joliet   195 cases have been filed  8 have been paid    Nationwide  of the 51 188 cases filed by former nuclear plant workers  only 11 829   or 23     have been paid   However  this 23  figure is misleading because it does not account for the thousands of workers who do not know they qualify for the program or those workers who died before they could submit a claim    Below  please find the full text of the letter      February 17  2006    The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC  20500   Dear Mr  President    I am deeply disturbed by recent press reports that the White House is planning to cut benefits to brave and hardworking Americans who developed cancer from working on the nuclear weapons program during the Cold War     The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  was enacted in 2000 to provide

because it does not account for the thousands of workers who do not know they qualify for the program or those workers who died before they could submit a claim    In Illinois  I have heard from many of my constituents about the problems they have experienced in filing claims and the red tape they have confronted over the years   Workers at 17 former Illinois nuclear weapons plants qualify under the EEOICPA   However  statistics from three of these plants demonstrate the difficulty in obtaining compensation   General Steel Industries plant in Granite City   408 cases have been filed  1 has been paid   Dow Chemical plant in Madison   164 cases have been filed  2 have been paid  Blockson Chemical plant in Joliet   195 cases have been filed  8 have been paid    I urge you to implement changes to streamline and expedite the process for filing claims and receiving compensation   I also request that you release the White House document describing the new interagency working group   In addition  I will be calling for the relevant Senate committees to hold hearings on this important matter    Mr  President  now is not the time to cut benefits for these former nuclear plant workers or put more bureaucratic red tape in front of them   These workers made a commitment to our country when the country needed them   Now it s our turn to help them in their time of need    Sincerely

1734,"SEN. SANDERS: 'WE MUST BRING OUR TROOPS HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE'
  President Bush is trying to create an illusion of change in Iraq, but in reality he is continuing the same disastrous war that he misled us into. Stay-the-course is the wrong course. In testimony before Senate committees, General David H. Petraeus was asked, 'General, when is this war going to end? One year? Two years? Five years?' He had nothing to say. ""So we're looking now at a war that has gone on longer than the war against Hitler, and the American people are saying enough is enough,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said. ""We must bring our troops home as soon as possible."" 
   General Petraeus's testimony, Senator Sanders told Vermont Public Radio, is part of an ongoing effort by the Bush administration to mislead the American public about the war. ""The fact that you are having Petraeus's report on 9/11 continues the mythology that the war in Iraq has something to do with the al Qaeda attack against the United States in 2001. Obviously it doesn't.""
   Asked about reports that the president is expected to seek an additional $50 billion to finance the war, the senator said, ""I will support the strongest legislation available and will be fighting for it to end this war as soon as possible to bring our troops home and certainly defunding this war is one appropriate step.""
   In a separate interview broadcast September 11 on BBC World News, he said, ""We need a whole new approach to combating international terrorism. While we are bogged down in Iraq spending billions and billions of dollars, Osama bin Laden remains free. Al Qaeda is growing in strength. The Afghanistan situation is deteriorating. Pakistan is deteriorating. Al-Qaeda is growing all over the world.""

                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY   Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  and Congressman Jerrold Nadler  NY 08   Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  announced today that they will conduct companion hearings into the failures of the Federal government in responding to the environmental crisis that resulted from the September 11  2001 World Trade Center attacks    For over five years  Clinton and Nadler have staunchly criticized the Administration s misleading public statements about post 9 11 air quality  as well as its continued failure to provide a proper testing and cleaning of indoor spaces contaminated by WTC toxins and its lack of provision of health care for the thousands of people who are ill as a result of exposure to the pollutants             These hearings represent the first comprehensive Congressional oversight investigations into these environmental matters since the immediate aftermath of the attacks   While in the Majority  Republican House leadership steadfastly refused to hold a single hearing on this matter  or even respond to a written request made in September 2003 by Nadler  then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  and then Ranking Members John Conyers  John Dingell  George Miller  and Henry Waxman   Read More              We need to examine what went wrong and assess whether the federal government is better prepared to respond to environmental hazards in future disasters   said Senator Clinton    I also remain concerned about potential indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center and want to take a close look at the EPA s inadequate program to test and clean residential areas in Manhattan            Finally  we have an opportunity to hear  on the record and first hand  who in the federal government was really responsible for key decisions about the handling of post 9 11 air quality   And from there we can finally learn why those decisions were made    decisions that are still having an impact on 9 11 victims today   said Nadler    The lack of thorough Congressional oversight thus far has allowed for years finger pointing and evading of responsibility on the part of the Federal government  but now is time for the truth  We must  at long last  get to the bottom of these matters  so we can do what is right for the heroes of 9 11  and ensure that we prevent anything like this from ever happening again   he added          The House hearing is scheduled to take place on Tuesday  May 22  2007  at 10 00 A M  in Room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building  and will examine the federal post 9 11 environmental response and related possible violations of the  substantive due process rights  of individuals living and working in the vicinity of the World Trade Center on  or after  September 11  2001   In a recent decision  the U S  District Court for the Southern District of New York found that former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman s falsely reassuring and misleading statements of safety after the September 11  2001 attacks were  without question conscience shocking    The court also found the facts  support an allegation of a violation of the substantive due process right to be free from official government policies that increase the risk of bodily harm  by Whitman s misstatements regarding the air quality of the affected area   An EPA Inspector General review reached similar conclusions   Invited to

 Environmental Protection Agency programs to test and clean indoor spaces in lower Manhattan   The hearing will also examine lessons learned from 9 11 and federal readiness to respond to releases of hazardous substances in future emergencies    The hearing is expected to include testimony from EPA and CEQ officials  as well as affected New Yorkers and scientific experts          ,0

1879,"CELEBRATE VERMONT HISTORY
  Landmark anniversaries are approaching for Lake Champlain and the Hudson River. The year 2009 will mark the 400th anniversary of when French explorer Samuel de Champlain sailed the lake that bears his name. It also was in 1609 when English explorer Henry Hudson led a Dutch East India Company expedition up the waterway named for him. The 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton's first use of commercial steam navigation, which happened on the Hudson, also will occur in 2009. A commission to coordinate the anniversary celebrations would be created under legislation introduced by senators from Vermont and New York.  
   Vermont Senators Sanders and Leahy and New York Senators Clinton and Schumer sponsored the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission Act of 2007. Congressman Peter Welch is a cosponsor of the legislation in the House, along with every member from the New York delegation. 
   ""Lake Champlain has played a huge part in Vermont history,"" Sanders said. ""The 400th anniversary gives us the chance to celebrate the past and renew our commitment to protect the lake for future generations."" 
   The legislation would empower the Secretary of the Interior to create a Commemoration Commission to plan, develop, and execute programs and activities appropriate for the anniversaries. This would include nationwide and international involvement in the festivity planning, support for marketing of commemorative stamps and coins, and funding for scholarly research on the voyage of Champlain. 
   Lake Champlain, initially called ""Bitawbagok"" by the Abenaki, was renamed by Champlain when he first traveled the waterway in 1609. The 300th anniversary, celebrated in 1909, included mock naval battles and fireworks in lakeside communities. In 1959, the people of Vermont and New York again came together to celebrate the rich history and natural beauty of their national treasures. As we approach the 400th anniversary, there is the potential for an unforgettable celebration for Vermonters, New Yorkers, and visitors alike. 
   Vermont and New York already have set up state commissions for the celebrations surrounding the anniversaries. To learn more about Vermont's commission, please visit www.celebratechamplain.org and for more about New York's commission, click on www.exploreny400.com.

453,   Obama Urges Congress to Clear Way For More States to Pass Iran Divestment Legislation   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Urges Congress to Clear Way For More States to Pass Iran Divestment Legislation Thursday  July 26  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today called on Congress to pass legislation that would clear the way for more states to divest their pension funds from businesses with assets in Iran   In May  Obama introduced the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act  S  1430   which empowers Americans to apply economic pressure on the Iranian regime by establishing a federal list of entities that invest in Iran and allowing for divestment   This legislation would enable investors and state and local governments to ensure they are not invested in companies that support Iran s oil and gas industry      The need for these laws is clear   said Senator Obama    Iran uses the revenue it generates from its energy sector to finance its pursuit of nuclear weapons and support for terrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas  Along with a sustained diplomatic effort and toughened multilateral sanctions on Iran  divestment is a useful tool that state and local governments can use to increase economic pressure to persuade Iran to end its dangerous policies      In the past  Supreme Court decisions have called into question whether states have the constitutional authority to pass such laws   For that reason  Congress needs to pass the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act  S  1430  which I introduced in May   This bill would clarify that states have the authority to pass divestment legislation with respect to Iran  and provide information from the federal government to make it easier for them to do so   I am proud that fourteen of my colleagues have cosponsored this bill so far  but Iran s seeming unbridled drive for nuclear weapons makes this a matter of considerable urgency   I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in working to pass this legislation without delay                                      ,1

495,   Obama Calls on President to Support Children   s Health Insurance Program  Repeal Restrictive Policies   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Obama Calls on President to Support Children   s Health Insurance Program  Repeal Restrictive Policies Monday  August 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Obama Press Office  202 228 5566 Nearly 9 million children currently lack health insurance WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to President Bush  calling on him to immediately rescind newly implemented restrictive policies for the Children   s Health Insurance Program  CHIP  and commit to supporting the program   s reauthorization   In the letter  Obama expresses serious concerns that the Administration   s new program requirements essentially abandon the children who need help the most by limiting access to CHIP   In August  the Senate voted to expand CHIP coverage to an additional four million children    The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President  I am writing to express my serious concerns over the Administration   s new policies for the Children   s Health Insurance Program  CHIP    These policies  which are detailed in a letter on August 17  2007  to state health officials from Dennis Smith  Director of the Center for Medicaid and State Operations  would severely restrict the ability of states to address the needs of its most vulnerable residents   There are few issues in this country that reflect a greater disconnect between what the American people want and the way Washington operates than health care coverage   And nowhere is this divide more apparent than in the millions of American children who lack health insurance   These are children who did not choose where they were born or how much money their parents have  children whose development depends on the care and nourishment they receive in those early years  children who any parent  anywhere  should want to protect at any cost   Insuring these children is a top priority for the American people  and those of us in Washington must do everything we can to protect them  One quarter of all children and half of low income children receive their health coverage through Medicaid or CHIP   Medicaid covers nearly 30 million poor and near poor children  and CHIP covers 6 7 million additional low income children and pregnant woman   Although we can debate the effectiveness of some federal programs  CHIP has been an unqualified success   After its enactment  the uninsured rate among low income children fell by more than one third from 1997 2005  even as the number and rate of uninsured adults rose steadily during the same time period    Unfortunately  this national trend has not continued  and the number of children without health coverage has started to rise since 2005   This reversal adds urgency to the national call to reauthorize and expand CHIP  and not contract it as the Administration   s new policies will do   Among the changes detailed in Mr  Smith   s letter is a requirement that states must demonstrate that they have enrolled at least 95 percent of the children with family incomes below 200 percent of poverty level before they can extend the eligibility limit to 250 percent   However  as your officials are well aware  no state has enrolled 95 percent of eligible children in CHIP to date   The Administration also proposes that in families with incomes above 250 percent of poverty level  children must be uninsured for a year before they can be eligible for CHIP   This requirement essentially abandons the children who need our help the most     those whose parents have lost their jobs and their employer provided health insurance   Today  nine million of our children still do not have health insurance  and the vast majority of Americans are calling on our government to do something about it   The Congress has done its part by recently passing the Senate reauthorization bill to allow an additional four million children to be covered and the House bill to cover upwards of five million children   State governments are also successfully tackling this enormous challenge by increasing outreach and enrollment  expanding eligibility  and by building upon CHIP as part of their state universal coverage initiatives    It is now time for the Administration to do its part for our children   We must ensure that all children have access to the health care they need  when they need it   As long as there are children in our country who lack health care coverage  we are fundamentally betraying the very morals and ideals we hold in our hearts as Americans   I ask that you immediately rescind these new policies and commit to passing the reauthorization of this critical program  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,1
1650,February 1  2006 Senator Clinton Urges President Bush to Increase Heating Aid by  2 9 Billion

                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with Senate colleagues today in urging President Bush to support increased heating aid of  2 9 billion to help families in New York and throughout the country deal with rising heating costs   At a press conference today  and in a letter to President Bush  Clinton underscored the hardships facing many New Yorkers as a result of higher natural gas and heating oil prices               Last night  the President talked about working with Congress to solve the country  s problems  and I can  t think of a better first step than for him to join with Congress to provide additional heating aid of  2 9 billion to help Americans get through the winter     said Senator Clinton     It is also critical that the President put  5 1 billion in heating assistance funds for next year in the budget that he sends to Congress next week              Clinton noted that in spite of the mild winter  higher energy prices mean that many communities are already running out of federal heating aid funds  provided through the Low Income Heating Assistance Program  LIHEAP              Upstate New York utility National grid recently revised their estimates  and predicted that the average homeowner they serve will pay about  360 dollars more for natural gas this year   That  s a 35 percent increase over last year  and it is typical of what families are facing across New York State     said Clinton     We should not leave communities and families to fend for themselves                 The full text of the letter to the President follows          February 1  2006         The President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500         Dear President Bush           High energy prices continue to threaten the health and economic well being of households across the United States  but especially low income families   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by supporting an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in FY 2006  and requesting  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in your FY 2007 budget request  the level authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005            The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   Unfortunately  energy prices do not appear to be dropping falling in the near future   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation   Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education           Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted four times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate  s support   Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote   In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans    Your leadership on this issue will help ensure that low income families and seniors get the help they deserve from the federal government             We respectfully request that you support supplemental funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006  and full funding for the program in FY2007 at its authorized level of  5 1 billion   We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs   Thank you for your consideration for this essential request            ,0

Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Administrator R  David Paulison  to accept the appeal by the City of Buffalo for reimbursement for the removal of tree stumps left behind from the October 12 13  2006 snowstorm  In a letter  the lawmakers expressed their concerns that the thousands of tree stumps that still remain pose a clear hazard to the health  safety and property to the community  However  cities like Buffalo have been overwhelmed by the costs involved with full removal  and federal aid is necessary as they continue on the road to recovery     Instead of marking the anniversary of last years snow storm by celebrating a successful recovery in the wake of the destruction  the citizens of Buffalo are still looking at thousands of tree stumps and we are appealing yet again to FEMA for federal aid  said Senator Clinton  Cities like Buffalo took action following the snowstorm to protect their residents and property by removing hazardous tree limbs and clearing debris  and while there is still much work to be done  it should not be left to the city to shoulder the incredible financial burden  This is why I am urging FEMA to accept the appeal submitted by the City of Buffalo for reimbursement of removal of the tree stumps left behind by last years severe snow storm    FEMAs self proclaimed mission is to assist with response and recovery  yet in Buffalos case  one year after last Octobers devastating snowstorm  this federal agency continues to shrug off accountability  sticking Buffalo residents with the bill to remove these unsightly tree stumps  said Senator Schumer  FEMA should overturn their foolhardy decision and give Buffalo the funding it needs to finish the job  Plain and simple  FEMA cannot wipe its hands and walk away from Buffalo and its residents    Although FEMA provided relief for the City of Buffalo immediately following the storm  there is still much to be done to fully recover nearly a year after the storm  said Rep  Louise Slaughter   These tree stumps littered throughout the city are a problem  and FEMA needs to provide the proper assistance for their removal     Over a year ago  Western New York experienced one of the worst storms in our history  said Rep  Tom Reynolds  Clarence     The city of good neighbors worked together to over come the many challenges we faced  We are still fighting together for what Western New York deserves  While FEMA s response was helpful  there are still a number of issues unresolved and we need answers and solutions not more bureaucratic talk     Stump removal is a significant expense directly related to October Storm and should be reimbursed by FEMA  said Congressman Higgins   While I understand the need for policies that protect against abuses and fraud  I urge FEMA to be flexible in considering the unique circumstances and valid needs resulting from this natural disaster in Buffalo     The snow storm that hit Western New York last October destroyed entire neighborhoods of trees  leaving local communities to clean up debris caused when the trees collapsed under the weight of the snow  While FEMA has been extremely helpful to the City of Buffalo and other cities impacted by the storm  their current stump removal policy does not meet the needs of the region in its effort to fully recover  As a result of the removal of thousands of storm damaged trees throughout Western New York  thousands of tree stumps remain in public rights of way  creating an immediate threat to public health and the safety of the community  The costs for the full removal of these stumps have overwhelmed state and local governments  which is why it is critical that FEMA accept the appeal by the City of Buffalo to provide the necessary federal assistance to the City for the removal of hazardous stumps    A Copy of the letter to FEMA Administrator Paulison is attached    October 11  2007   The Honorable R  David Paulison  Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  United States Department of Homeland Security  500 C Street  S W   Washington  D C  20472   Dear Administrator Paulison    We are writing in regards to the appeal that has been submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  by the City of Buffalo for reimbursement for the removal of tree stumps left behind from the October 12 13  2006 snowstorm   The President issued a major disaster declaration  FEMA NY DR1665  for the area on October 15 and federal aid was made available to the state and local governments to assist in recovery efforts   While FEMA has been extremely helpful to the City of Buffalo and other cities impacted by the storm  the City of Buffalo and others continues to face an extremely large obstacle in its road to recovery as a result of the number of tree stumps left behind from the storm    FEMAs current stump removal policy RP9523 11  Hazardous Stump Extraction and Removal Eligibility  does not meet the needs of the region in its effort to fully recover from the October 2006 snowstorm   As a result of the removal of thousands of storm damaged trees throughout Western New York  thousands of tree stumps remain in public rights of way   These stumps  whether cut flush to grade or left a few inches above grade  pose an immediate threat to the public health and safety of the community   The location of many of these stumps  within the public right of way and primarily between the curb and sidewalk  creates a hazardous condition   During times of light snow cover or when it is dark  it is difficult to see a stump creating a tripping or slip and fall hazard   Additionally  tree stumps left in the ground will rot and create dangerous and unhealthy conditions as they are often infested by rodents and insects   It is in the public interest to remove these stumps pursuant to Sections 403  407  and 503 of the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act      As a result of these stumps and the hazardous conditions that remain  lawsuits stemming from these hazardous stumps have been numerous and costly   New York courts have consistently held that tree stumps located within public rights of way are inherently dangerous   The City of Buffalo has already settled a number of claims for damage to cars and property from tree stumps stemming from the October 2006 snowstorm      The thousands of tree stumps that resulted from the October 2006 snowstorm are not only unsightly  but are clearly dangerous to the health  safety and property to the community   Federal assistance is necessary in order to eliminate or at least reduce immediate threats   The costs for the full removal of these stumps have overwhelmed state and local governments and federal assistance is needed   Therefore we respectfully request that FEMA accept the appeal by the City of Buffalo and provide the necessary federal assistance to the City for the removal of hazardous stumps     Sincerely yours

President Bush must get authorization from Congress before taking military action against Iran in a speech on the floor of the U S  Senate this afternoon   Saying that Iran poses a threat to U S  allies and interests  Clinton said that no option can be taken off the table in the effort to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons but that the United States must proceed deliberately and wisely            Citing the Bush Administration s blunders and mismanagement of Iraq  Clinton said   It would be a mistake of historical proportion if the administration thought that the 2002 resolution authorizing force against Iraq was a blank check for the use of force against Iran without further congressional authorization   Nor should the President think that the 2001 resolution authorizing force after the terrorist attacks of 9 11 in any way authorizes force against Iran  If the administration believes that any  any use of force against Iran is necessary  the president must come to Congress to seek that authority        The full text of Senator Clinton s remarks follows       Mr  President  at this moment of challenge for our nation  the vantage point of this august chamber  we look onto a world filled with danger  deeply complex threats against our troops and our national interests abroad  and genuine risks to our security here at home  Keeping our nation strong and our people safe requires that we employ the best and smartest strategies available                       In confronting enemies and threats  we are fortunate to possess a great many assets  all of which we must wisely deploy  including our military  diplomatic  economic  and cultural assets  Our strongest asset remains the democracy that we are privileged to take part in as members of the Senate and as representatives of our constituents  Our democratic institutions  under our Constitution  balance one another and check against excesses and concentrations of power that help us wrestle with difficult challenges in an open and forthright way  This constitutional framework is not an obstacle to pursuing our national security  but the example that we should project to the world  Our democracy  with its tradition of accountable power and open debate  is America at its best  And that s what we need  America at our best  as we deliberately and resolutely confront the threat posed by the Iranian regime                       Now  make no mistake  Iran poses a threat to our allies and our interests in the region and beyond  including the United States  The Iranian president has held a conference denying the Holocaust and has issued bellicose statement after bellicose statement calling for Israel and the United States to be wiped off the map  His statements are even more disturbing and urgent when viewed in the context of the regime s quest to acquire nuclear weapons  The regime also uses its influence and resources in the region to support terrorist elements that attack Israel  Hezbollah s attack on Israel this summer  using Iranian weapons  clearly demonstrates Iran s malevolent influence even beyond its borders  We also have evidence  although it is by no means conclusive  of attacks using Iranian supplied or manufactured weaponry against our own American soldiers  As I have long said and will continue to say  U S  policy must be clear and unequivocal  We cannot  we should not  we must not permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons  And in dealing with this threat  as I ve also said for a long time  no option can be taken off the table                       But America must proceed deliberately and wisely  and we must proceed as a unified nation  The smartest and strongest policy will be one forged through the institutions of our democracy  That is the genius of our American system and our constitutional duty  We have witnessed these past six years   until the most recent election of a new Congress by the American people   the cost of congressional dereliction of its oversight duty  a vital role entrusted to Congress by our constituents  enshrined in  and even required by our Constitution  So we are here today because the price that has been paid in blood and treasure  through the rush to war in Iraq and the incompetence of its execution and managing the aftermath  in the excesses of military contracting abuses and the inadequate supply of body armor and armored vehicles on the ground have led to a loss of confidence among our allies and the American people in this Administration  Therefore  Mr  President  we cannot and we must not allow recent history to repeat itself                       We continue to experience the consequences of unchecked Presidential action  Sunlight is the best disinfectant  but this President was allowed  for too long  to commit blunder after blunder under cover of darkness provided by an allied Republican Congress                       In dealing with the threats posed by the Iranian regime  which has gained its expanding influence in Iraq and the region as a result of the Administration s policies  President Bush must not be allowed to act without the authority and oversight of Congress  It would be a mistake of historical proportion if the Administration thought that the 2002 resolution authorizing force against Iraq was a blank check for the use of force against Iran without further Congressional authorization  Nor should the President think that the 2001 resolution authorizing force after the terrorist attacks of 9 11  in any way  authorizes force against Iran  If the Administration believes that any  any use of force against Iran is necessary  the President must come to Congress to seek that authority                       I am deeply concerned by the recent statements coming out of the Bush Administration  The Administration has asserted evidence of the Iranian regime s complicity  at the highest levels  for attacks within Iraq  Yet at the same time  General Peter Pace  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  questions these as assertions  in particular  the capability and intentions of the Iranian government  In this delicate situation  while making disturbing comments   there are reports that the Administration  is sending a third aircraft carrier to the Gulf                       The President owes an on going consultation to this Congress and owes straight talk to the country  We have to get this right  The Congress should debate our current course  including the current silent treatment policy toward our adversaries  I believe we can better understand how to deal with an adversary such as Iran if we have some direct contact with them  I think that can give us valuable information and better leverage to hold over the Iranian regime  And if we ever must  with Congressional agreement  take drastic action  we should make clear to the world that we have exhausted every other possibility                       I welcome the agreement announced yesterday between the United States and North Korea  It demonstrates the central value of using every tool in our arsenal to achieve our objectives  I only wish the Administration had pursued this course six years ago when an agreement with North Korea was within reach  The wasted time has allowed North Korea to develop nuclear weapons in the interim  Failure to use diplomacy has damaged our national security interests  The important step forward our country has made with North Korea raises the obvious question  Why will the President refuse to have any kind of process involving Iran as I and others have urged                              The United States engaged in talks with North Korea within a multilateral process  but also had ongoing bilateral discussions  We should have such a process of direct engagement with Iran  as recommended by many  including the Iraq Study Group  We need friends and allies to stand with us in this long war against terrorism and extremism  and to contain and alter the regimes that harbor and support those who would harm us  During the cold war  we spoke to the Soviet Union while thousands of missiles were pointed at our cities  while its leaders threatened to bury us  while the regime sewed discord and military uprisings and actions against us and our allies  That was a smart strategy used by Republican and Democratic Presidents alike  even though it was often a difficult one                      As we discuss potential evidence of Iranian complicity in supplying arms to insurgents  along with the refusal to suspend their nuclear ambitions  we need to deliver a strong message to Iran that we will not stand by and tolerate this behavior  However  we need to deliver that message forcefully through direct talks  The lives of American soldiers are at risk and we should not outsource our discussions with the Iranians on this and other issues  When I say no option should be taken off the table  I include diplomacy                       Currently  our intelligence on Iran is of uncertain quality  We need to examine the facts closely and carefully  No action can or should be taken without explicit Congressional authorization  And knowing what we know now  this body needs a steady stream of real  verifiable intelligence  We  in the Congress  cannot do our part in deciding what needs to be done if we do not know what is happening  And it does not appear that the administration has any real grasp on the facts on the ground  even after all these years  The public unclassified sections of the NIE report recently issued  made it very clear in their conclusions that sectarian violence would still exist in Iraq absent Iran                       So we have a lot to sort out here  We have all learned lessons from the conflict in Iraq  and we have to apply those lessons to any allegations that are being raised about Iran  Because  Mr  President  what we are hearing has too familiar a ring and we must be on guard that we never again make decisions on the basis of intelligence that turns out to be faulty  If we find evidence of potential Iranian complicity  we will take appropriate action  but that requires a partnership to defend and protect America s national security interests between the Congress and the President                      Oversight will also lead to a consensus approach that brings together the best judgments and strategies of our nation and will examine the consequences of action  the reality of any perceived or alleged threat  and the consequences of taking action  I sometimes fear that the word  consequence  has been taken out of the vocabulary of this Administration  We have to look over the horizon  We have to make hard choices among difficult options                       So  Mr  President  there are no easy answers to the complex situations we confront in the world today  but if we do face threats  then Congressional consultation and authorization will bring the American people into the debate  Whatever steps  if any  may be required should be taken by our nation  not just by our President  We must act as Americans  not as members of one party or another  Our nation has been divided by a failed policy and the relentless pursuit of it  We are facing that again with the escalation policy that the President is pursuing today                       Mr  President  if we face up to our constitutional responsibilities as the Congress  if we conduct the oversight that is required  if we exercise our checks and balances  then we are likely to reach a better conclusion than we have thus far  We must be tough and smart  deliberative and wise  and we must look at all of our assets  not just the brave men and women who wear the uniform of our country to implement the best policy  We should start by employing our best values  the democratic values that give strength to our nation and our cause  and that serve as an example and beacon to people who wish to live in peace and freedom and prosperity around the world           Mr  President  I yield the floor                   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq          ,0
1759,"SEN. SANDERS INTRODUCES GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION REDUCTION ACT
  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, announced today that he will be introducing the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act on Tuesday with Senators Barbara Boxer, Patrick Leahy, Edward Kennedy, Robert Menendez, Frank Lautenberg, Jack Reed, Daniel Akaka, Daniel Inouye, Russell Feingold, and Sheldon Whitehouse. The act calls for an 80% reduction - compared to 1990 levels - in global warming pollutants by 2050 and offers the most progressive and comprehensive solution to reduce greenhouse gasses across the nation. 
   Senator Bernie Sanders said, ""If left unchecked, global warming will have a devastating impact on our nation and our planet. We must, as soon as humanly possible, break our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly Middle East oil, and move to greater energy efficiency and renewable, non-polluting sources of energy. The good news is that we know how to address the problem. The bad new is that, for many years now, government policy has been totally inadequate. The forward-thinking legislation will put the United States on track to lead the way towards a cleaner future for all and I look forward to strong support as we push to protect our planet.""  
   Originally introduced by former Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont, the bill sets out a roadmap of targets, requirements and incentives that EPA will use to reduce U.S emissions and help stabilize global atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Specifically, the act sets a goal of achieving a reduction in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that will help stabilize global concentrations below 450 parts per million--a critical level as recognized by leading climate scientists. To achieve this goal, the United States must reduce its emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and make additional reductions between 2020 and 2050. The bill includes a combination of economy wide reduction targets, mandatory measures, and incentives for the development and diffusion of cleaner technologies to achieve these goals. A summary of the act's provisions is attached. 
   Senator Barbara Boxer, chairwoman of the EPW Committee said, ""This is the gold standard bill, as originally laid out by Senator Jim Jeffords, and I am very proud to be a cosponsor of it."" 
   The legislation is supported by such national groups as the Earth Day Network, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, Environmental & Energy Study Institute, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of Conservation Voters, National Audubon Society, National Environmental Trust, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, and US PIRG. 
   Senator Sanders said, ""The concept is simple. Not only will this move our country towards efficient, sustainable energy sources, it will also help us create millions of good-paying jobs in the process."" 
   Senator Jim Jeffords said, ""I am pleased that Senator Sanders has lost no time in placing comprehensive global warming legislation before the U.S. Senate, and proud that work I did last year will not be lost. Bernie clearly understands that global warming is the most serious environmental problem confronting the United States and the world, and that Federal action is long past due. With Bernie as a member of the Environment Committee, and new leadership in place, we may finally see some action."" 
   Senator Patrick Leahy said, ""Global warming is by far one of the most critical issues of our time. I am pleased to join Senator Sanders in reintroducing global warming reduction legislation in this new Congress. This forward-looking legislation first introduced by former Vermont Senator Jim Jeffords last year takes an aggressive approach to combating the dangerous effects of global warming."" 
   Senator Edward Kennedy said, ""This legislation will set the nation on a course to aim for necessary and achievable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We can't wait any longer to take bold steps to fight global warming or else the damage could be irreversible and the consequences will be disastrous."" 
   Senator Robert Menendez said, ""I am encouraged by the increased national awareness of global warming in recent years, and the personal choices many individuals have taken to cut emissions. But there is more we can do, and strong leadership is required on a federal level to fight such a devastating problem. Mandating lower greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to protect coastal states like New Jersey from rising sea levels, to promote a more fit environment for ourselves and our children, and to guarantee a healthy world for generations to come."" 
   Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee said, ""Global warming is real, and is a threat to the entire planet. It's melting our glaciers, changing the conditions of our oceans, affecting our weather and hurting our wildlife. The Bush administration has not acted for six years. So now we will act - and offer serious, comprehensive legislation to address this global problem."" 
   Senator Jack Reed said, ""Climate change is one of the defining issues of our time, and the United States must provide meaningful action to address this problem. Climate change affects our environment, economy, and security. We must take steps at the local, state, and national levels to slow, stop, and reverse global warming emissions. It is time for the federal government to step up in this fight, and that is what this legislation seeks to do."" 
   Senator Daniel Akaka said, """"The global warming debate began in Hawaii over 30 years ago when the Mauna Loa Climate Observatory first documented evidence of increased carbon dioxide levels in the Earth's atmosphere. U.S. emits the most greenhouse gases in the world. We must be accountable as a world leader in reducing emissions and combating the threats resulting from global warming."" 
   Senator Russell Feingold said, ""One of the greatest challenges facing our nation is the need to reduce our contributions to global climate change before it is too late. The American public is looking to Congress to address this problem, and the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act provides a strong, comprehensive approach."" 
   Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee said, ""From Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay to ecosystems and communities all over the world, global warming is a serious threat that demands immediate and urgent action. This measure will put the United States in a position of real global leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and I'm proud to support it.""

 Andy Fisher  andy_fisher foreign senate gov   202  224 2079  Date  May 23  2006   Lugar Obama Bill to Keep Weapons Out of Terrorists  Hands Heads to Senate Floor Bipartisan Effort Focuses on Antiaircraft Missiles  Stolen WMDs and Conventional Weapons used in Improvised Roadside Bombs   WASHINGTON   The U S  Senate Foreign Relations Committee today passed out of committee  S  2566  the Lugar Obama Act   Modeled after the Nunn Lugar program that focuses on weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union  the bill was introduced by Sens  Dick Lugar  R IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  to expand the cooperative threat reduction concept to conventional weapons     Lugar Obama would expand the detection and interdiction of weapons and materials of mass destruction    A full list of the legislation  nominations and treaties passed out of committee and headed to the Senate floor is available at      The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the number one national security threat that confronts the United States today   Under Senator Lugar s leadership  the Nunn Lugar program has safely disposed of literally thousands of weapons of mass destruction which  had they fallen into the wrong hands  could have been used against America with catastrophic results   The Lugar Obama bill will build on this success by helping other nations find and eliminate conventional weapons that have been used against our own soldiers in Iraq and sought by terrorists all over the world   said Obama      We are convinced that the United States can and should do more to eliminate conventional weapons stockpiles and assist other nations in detecting and interdicting weapons of mass destruction   We believe that these functions are underfunded  fragmented and in need of high level support   Lugar said     We are particularly concerned that our government has the capacity to deal quickly with vulnerable stockpiles of shoulder fired anti aircraft missiles  known as MANPADS   In recent years  concerns have grown that such weapons could be used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners  military installations  and government facilities here at home and abroad   Al Qaeda reportedly has attempted to acquire MANPADS on a number of occasions   said Lugar    The first part of the Lugar Obama legislation would energize the U S  program against unsecured lightweight anti aircraft missiles and other conventional weapons   There may be as many as 750 000 man portable air defense systems in arsenals worldwide  and the State Department estimates that more than 40 civilian aircraft have been hit by such weapons since the 1970s   In addition  loose stocks of small arms and other weapons help fuel civil wars in Africa and elsewhere and provide the means for attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers seeking to stabilize war torn societies   In Iraq  unsecured stockpiles of artillery shells and ammunition have been reconfigured into improvised explosive devices  IEDs  that have become the insurgents  most effective weapon     The second part of Lugar Obama would strengthen the ability of America s allies to detect and interdict illegal shipments of weapons and materials of mass destruction   U S  security depends not just on the willingness of other nations to help  it depends on whether they have the capabilities to be effective   The State Department engages in several related anti terrorism and export control assistance programs   But these programs are focused on other stages of the threat  not on detection and interdiction  and create a gap in our defenses that needs to be filled    The Lugar Obama bill would increase by  25 million funding available for the elimination of conventional weapons and MANPADS and by  50 million funding to assist countries in improving their ability to detect and interdict materials and weapons of mass destruction   This offers a potent but flexible tool to build a robust international network to stop proliferation     Lugar and Obama traveled together to Russia  Ukraine and Azerbaijan in August to oversee a number of Nunn Lugar projects   In Ukraine they saw a conventional weapons facility that is typical of the focus of the new legislation    In 1991  Senator Lugar  R IN  and former Senator Sam Nunn  D GA  authored the Nunn Lugar Act  which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  This program has provided U S  funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  related materials  and delivery systems  In 1997  Lugar and Nunn were joined by Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  in introducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act  which expanded Nunn Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided WMD expertise to first responders in American cities  In 2003  Congress adopted the Nunn Lugar Expansion Act  which authorized the Nunn Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats  In October 2004  Nunn Lugar funds were used for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to secure chemical weapons in Albania  under a Lugar led expansion of the program    The latest Nunn Lugar Scorecard shows that the program has deactivated or destroyed  6 828 nuclear warheads  611 ICBMs  485 ICBM silos  55 ICBM mobile missile launchers  152 bombers  865 nuclear air to surface missiles  436 submarine missile launchers  563 submarine launched missiles  29 nuclear submarines  and 194 nuclear test tunnels    Beyond the scorecard s nuclear elimination  the Nunn Lugar program secures and destroys chemical weapons  and works to reemploy scientists and facilities related to biological weapons in peaceful research initiatives  The International Science and Technology Centers  of which the United States is the leading sponsor  have engaged 58 000 former weapons scientists in peaceful work  The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded 750 projects involving 14 000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high tech jobs  Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn Lugar program  They otherwise would be the world s the third  fourth and eighth largest nuclear weapons powers  respectively

  The Senate today put finishing touches on housing stimulus legislation, adding a $57 million proposal authored by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that would increase federal grants to help disabled veterans adapt their homes. 
   ""With so many soldiers coming back from Iraq with disabilities, it is absolutely imperative that we make sure they have as normal a life as possible and that certainly includes adapting their homes to meet their needs,"" Sanders said.
   The final bill, which the Senate approved 84 to 12, also included energy tax credits cosponsored by Sanders that would promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. It would extend expiring federal tax benefits for investment in solar, wind and other sustainable energy sources.
   Sanders also was the lead cosponsor of a successful amendment by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) that would guarantee Vermont a $20 million share of $4 billion in community development block grants to prevent home foreclosures and to refurbish abandoned homes.
   Under the veterans amendment, veterans with certain severe service-connected disabilities would be eligible for grants of up to $60,000, a $10,000 boost from the current law, to build wheelchair ramps and to make other changes so they could live at home. Veterans who were blinded or lost arms in war zones or while on active duty may receive up to $12,000, a $2,000 increase, for remodeling their homes.
   The amendment also would provide for automatic annual adjustments pegged to a home construction cost index to ensure that the benefits keep pace with rising prices. Wounded veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have found that the program now on the books does not cover all of the costs of adapting their homes.
   Sanders' amendment was supported by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Vietnam Veterans of America, AMVETS, Paralyzed Veterans of America and others.
   Before passing the bill, the Senate also added the energy provisions. ""There are huge opportunities that we will lose if we do not extend these sustainable energy tax credits,"" Sanders said. ""Not only will these tax credits enable us to continue our effort to break our dependency on the fossil fuels that cause global warming and pollute our environment, but they will provide a significant number of good-paying green jobs in the areas of wind, solar and geothermal - something that I am working very hard on and believe has tremendous potential for our economy.""
   The Leahy-Sanders Amendment would allot $20 million to help Vermont deal with the foreclosure crisis that is sweeping the country. ""With this funding, it is my hope that Vermont's cities and towns will be able to provide immediate assistance to the struggling middle class trying to hold onto their homes and improve communities hit hard by foreclosures,"" Sanders said. ""Clearly, we must do everything we can to prevent the American dream of homeownership from turning into the American nightmare of foreclosure that too many American families are experiencing.""

1919,"ECONOMIC STIMULUS HOME HEATING HELP
  Senator Bernie Sanders and others are pushing to include home-energy assistance funding in an economic stimulus package the Senate is debating. Growing energy costs and cold weather have made additional funding a necessity for low-income families, seniors on fixed incomes and the disabled. Funding in the stimulus plan would be used immediately to help pay utility bills, jumpstart the economy and support small businesses that deliver heating fuels. ""The price of energy is skyrocketing. People in Vermont and all over this country are paying record prices to heat their homes this winter. In the richest country on the face of the earth, we must ensure that no one goes cold this winter. In the United States of America, no American should be forced to make the unacceptable choice between heating their homes, paying for their prescription drugs or putting food on the table. We must not let that happen,"" Sanders said.  
   ""In early December,"" Sanders added, ""I introduced the Keeping Americans Warm Act to provide an additional $1 billion in Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program with 27 bi-partisan co-sponsors. I have introduced several amendments to increase LIHEAP funding both this month and last month.
   ""At a time when home heating prices are going through the roof, and it is getting colder and colder every day, increased LIHEAP funding would provide immediate real relief to millions of senior citizens on fixed incomes; low-income families with children; and persons with disabilities. 
   ""According, to the latest statistics from the Energy Information Administration, it will cost the average heating oil consumer over $2,000 to heat their homes this winter, an increase of more than 37 percent from last year. Even worse, the National Energy Assistance Directors Association project that in some parts of the Northeast, heating oil consumers will pay over $3,000 to heat their homes over the course of this winter. 
   ""The spike in energy costs is completely eviscerating the purchasing power of this extremely important program in State after State. If Congress does not act soon to confront this problem head-on, I fear for the public health and safety of millions of our most vulnerable Americans.
   ""In some parts of Vermont, it has been reported that consumers are paying as much as $3.70 a gallon for heating oil and as much as $3.99 a gallon for propane. To put this in perspective, just four years ago, the price for heating oil was only $1.50 a gallon, and propane prices were even lower.
   ""These outrageously high home heating costs are pushing Vermont families into homelessness. In fact, it is not uncommon for families with two working parents to receive help from homeless shelters in my State because they can't afford anyplace else to live this winter.
   ""It will not be easy to include increased LIHEAP funding into the economic stimulus bill. But, it's not our job to do what's easy. Our job is to do what is right. And, not only is including LIHEAP in the economic stimulus package the right thing to do, it is the moral thing to do. We have got to get this done.

                         Clinton Concerned that the Plan  s Potentially Severe Economic Impact and Serious Data Security and Privacy Concerns Have Not Been Taken Into Consideration    In Detailed Submission to the Department Of State  Senator Calls for a Full Economic Impact Study and an Assessment of Data Security and Privacy Concerns with the Proposal Before Any Further Decisions are Made                              Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton continued to express her concerns today over the Administration  s proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  including the card format passport or   passport card      In a long and full submission to the Department of State today  Senator Clinton said the Administration  s position on the card has   begun to strain credulity    and she seriously questioned its failure to consider the economic impact of the initiative or the data security and privacy concerns it poses to local residents along New York  s Northern Border       Click here to access a complete copy of Senator Clinton  s submission         The proposed rule is a matter of tremendous importance to my constituents in New York  as well as all Americans who live along the northern border   The security of our nation and its borders must be our greatest priority   However  in imposing new travel restrictions at the border  we must remain sensitive to the profound economic and social impact new restrictions can have on border communities   There is tremendous and legitimate concern that the Initiative would not only devastate the tourism and retail industry  but also greatly disrupt life on both sides of the American Canadian border   The notice of proposed rulemaking appears to largely neglect these concerns     Senator Clinton said in her submission today              The passport card as described in the notice of proposed rulemaking poses several problems   At the root of these problems are the card  s cost and the burden it would impose on U S  citizen travelers   The card would cost a total of  45 for an adult and  35 for a child  a burdensome cost that could prove prohibitive for many families who live in our border communities   In addition to cost  the proposal imposes several hurdles to attaining the passport card   State will issue and adjudicate the passport card in a manner similar to traditional passports   The notice does not mandate a specific turn around time for an application for a passport card  saying only that it would be the same as for a passport  which is roughly four to six weeks   No exception is allowed for the elderly or groups of minors on trips   No provision is made for day passes or those who appear at a border crossing without the proper documentation     Senator Clinton continued                Given the considerable evidence that the WHTI would have a dramatic and negative effect on the economies of border communities  it is troubling that State and DHS still have not conducted a review of the economic impact of the Initiative  and have not completed a single cost benefit analysis of their proposed passport card requirement and potential alternatives   In fact  in the notice of proposed rulemaking  State continues to take the position that a passport card rule is not an   economically significant regulatory action     that the rule is   not likely to have an annual effect on the economy of  100 million or more or to adversely affect in a material way the economy       or State  local  or tribal governments or communities     and therefore no rigorous cost benefit analysis is necessary under the law at all            This position has begun to strain credulity   Even setting to one side the overwhelming evidence that the Initiative will have a dramatic annual impact on the economy of border states  State itself estimates that 6 8 million  or about 51 percent  of U S  citizens who visited Canada in 2005 did not possess a passport   Even if only a fraction of those individuals were to purchase a passport card in a given year  the sale of the card itself would have an economic impact of more than  100 million in that year   Of course  if most of these individuals choose not to purchase the necessary documents to cross the border  the impact on cross border trade will be even more significant            The Government Accountability Office concluded earlier this year that DHS and State had yet to make many key programmatic and technical decisions regarding the Initiative  that the remaining issues present numerous challenges  and that DHS has not requested any funds to implement the Initiative in 2007   Congress has given the Administration an extra year and a half in order to implement new border crossing rules with care   Once again  in the strongest possible terms  I urge the Administration to use the additional time to perform a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits of the Initiative and the passport card requirement  with an emphasis on the impact the requirements would have on the economies of our border communities  and a careful review of alternatives   The stakes are far too high for the Administration to continue to march forward in the dark on this important issue without any understanding of the economic consequences of its proposed plan     the Senator continued          Senator Clinton also pointed out that many of her constituents are concerned about the security of the information that would be contained on the card     The notice announces that the proposed passport card would use   vicinity read    radio frequency identification  RFID  technology   However  State and DHS do not appear to have tested this technology for use in a personal ID card  and a number of industry and privacy groups have voiced serious concerns that the RFID technology gives rise to several privacy and security concerns and that other options are preferable   Border identification requirements will not be successful unless people are confident that their personal information is secure   I urge State and DHS to give careful consideration to concerns that it has chosen the wrong technology for its program     the Senator said           ,0

Voinovich  R Ohio   Charles Schumer  D N Y    and Patty Murray  D Wash     The resolution introduced today comes in the wake of protests that have swept across Tibet  and reports that these protests have been met with overwhelming force and a crackdown by the Chinese government  Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of fatalities  and the arrest of more than 1 000 protesters in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of China    As a friend of China and the Dalai Lama  I am saddened to see the situation in Tibet deteriorate to this point   Senator Feinstein said   Violence cannot solve this matter   The United States must use its influence to bring the Government of China and the people of Tibet together to begin the process of reconciliation and dialogue    In the 1990s  I carried three letters to President Jiang Zemin from the Dalai Lama requesting a face to face meeting   Six rounds of talks since 2002 between the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China and representatives of His Holiness have not yielded any results   So  I urge the leadership in China to begin the process of open substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama on meaningful Tibetan religious and cultural autonomy within the People s Republic of China     Senator Smith said   China s violent crackdown on the people of Tibet is inexcusable  They have long sought acceptance among the ranks of global leaders  but the methodical and brutal oppression of free speech  political protest and the repression of an entire ethnic population are not the actions of a world leader  The Chinese government must act immediately to end the violence    It is critical that the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama engage in a mutually respectful dialogue to restore peace and stability in Tibet   said Senator Biden   By engaging in talks with Tibet instead of violence  President Hu would gain the opportunity to speak the motto of the Beijing Olympics    One World  One Dream    to the entire international community  I can think of no greater symbol of peace than to have President Hu Jin tao and the Dalai Lama jointly attend the opening ceremony of the games  united in their commitment to promote genuine reconciliation on the Tibetan plateau   Specifically  the resolution  Condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint by the Government of the People s Republic of China and the people of Tibet  Calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within China and urges that these discussions take place with all deliberate speed   Calls for the release of individuals who protested in a peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and wounded in the violence that followed the protests   Calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts to enter monasteries to  reeducate  monks and nuns  to respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the Dalai Lama and possess his photograph  and to respect and protect basic human rights  as provided in the Constitution of the People s Republic of China   Calls on the Government of China to honor its commitment to allow international journalists free access to China from mid 2007 to October 17  2008   Calls on the Government of China to provide a full accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet  the response of the Government of China  and the manner and number of detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests   Calls on the United States Department of State to fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002  22 USC 6901 note   including the stipulation that the Secretary of State  seek to establish an office in Lhasa  Tibet to monitor political  economic  and cultural developments in Tibet   and also to provide consular protection and citizen services in emergencies  and Urges that the agreement to permit China to open further diplomatic missions in the United States should be contingent upon the establishment of a United States Government office in Lhasa  Tibet    China s crackdown on the people of Tibet is inexcusable   Senator Brown said   Beijing has long sought a place at the table of global leaders  But systematic and violent repression of free speech  political protest and the eradication of ethnic culture  religion  and language are not the acts of a world leader  nor a country we should be striving to open to free trade  President Hu Jintao must take immediate steps to end the violent repression  open up to western media and release all political prisoners    In order to reach its full potential as a global leader  China must respect human rights and religious freedom of all its citizens   said Senator Cantwell    Dialogue with the Dalai Lama is essential   Senator Menendez said   The people of Tibet deserve communication  not crackdowns from the Chinese government  If they choose to voice their opinions  they deserve the right to be treated with civility and humanity  Instead  they are met with deadly violence  It s time for the dialogue to begin and the Dalai Lama to be included     Every day we learn about the tragedies facing the Tibetan people  and I condemn the use of violence to confront peaceful protests   said Senator Obama    It s time that the Chinese government respect and protect the basic human rights  religion  and culture of the Tibetan people   Senator Dole said   Particularly as the world prepares to turn its attention to the summer 2008 Beijing Olympic Games  China should be taking steps to improve its human rights and religious freedom record   Unfortunately  China instead has engaged in a harsh repression of the people of Tibet  adding to their already negative influence in the crackdown in Burma   The violence needs to end     Following is the text of the resolution introduced today   Whereas  beginning on March 10  2008  Tibetans and Tibetan Buddhist monks began demonstrations in Lhasa  the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region in the People s Republic of China  Whereas those protests spread to elsewhere in the Tibet Autonomous Region and to Tibetan autonomous areas in the Sichuan  Gansu  and Qinghan provinces of China  Whereas  long suppressed resentment prompted violent clashes between demonstrators and government forces in the streets of Lhasa  resulting in innocent civilian casualties  the burning of buildings  and extensive property damage  Whereas Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of fatalities  and the arrest of more than 1 000 protesters in the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of China  Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism and the Dalai Lama is the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism  Whereas  the Government of China continues to restrict the rights of Tibetan Buddhists to practice their religion freely  Whereas the Dalai Lama has condemned the violence that began on March 14  2008  and announced his continuing support for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing  China  Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he does not seek independence for Tibet from China and has called for negotiations to bring about meaningful autonomy for Tibet that allows Tibetans to maintain their distinctive identity within China  Whereas the Constitution of the People s Republic of China guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens  but the 2007 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom of the Department of State states that   d uring the period covered by this report  the Government  of China  s respect for freedom of religion remained poor   and Whereas  following the demonstrations that began on March 10  2008  the Government of China began severely restricting access to journalists and diplomats and creating a shortage of independent verification of the situation on the ground in Tibet  Now  therefore  be it Resolved  That the Senate    1  condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint by the Government of the People s Republic of China and the people of Tibet   2  calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within China and urges that these discussions take place with all deliberate speed   3  calls for the release of individuals who protested in a peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and wounded in the violence that followed the protests   4  calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts to enter monasteries to  reeducate  monks and nuns  to respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the Dalai Lama and possess his photograph  and to respect and protect basic human rights  as provided in the Constitution of the People s Republic of China   5  calls on the Government of China to honor its commitment to allow international journalists free access to China from mid 2007 to October 17  2008   6  calls on the Government of China to provide a full accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet  the response of the Government of China  and the manner and number of detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests  and  7  both     A  calls on the United States Department of State to fully implement the Tibetan Policy Act of

545,   Obama  Lugar Introduce The American Fuels Act to Reduce U S  Dependence on Foreign Oil   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Lugar Introduce The American Fuels Act to Reduce U S  Dependence on Foreign Oil Friday  March 17  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Lugar Contact  Andy Fisher   202  224 2079  Date  March 17  2006  Obama  Lugar Introduce The American Fuels Act to Reduce U S  Dependence on Foreign Oil   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Richard Lugar  R IN  Friday said that they have introduced comprehensive legislation that will use alternative fuel technologies to greatly decrease America s dependence on foreign oil     For all of our military might and economic dominance  the Achilles  heel of the most powerful country on Earth is still the oil we cannot live without   said Obama   I could give you all plenty of reasons why it s a good idea for this country to move away from an oil based economy  but all we really need to know about the danger of our oil addiction comes directly from words spoken by Osama bin Laden   Focus your operations on oil  especially in Iraq and the Gulf area  since this will cause them to die off  on their own       Obama and Lugar s bipartisan legislation  the American Fuels Act of 2006  S  2446   would take a four step approach to reducing America s dependence on foreign oil  First  the legislation would spur investment in alternative fuels by increasing the production of cellulosic biomass ethanol  CBE  to 250 million gallons by 2012  It would also create an Alternative Diesel Standard that will require 2 billion gallons of alternatives diesels be mixed into the 40 billion gallon annual national diesel pool by 2015  This proposal is modeled of the Renewable Fuels Standard  which has proved successful in increasing ethanol production and use    Second  the legislation would help increase consumer demand for alternative fuels by providing a short term  35 cents per gallon tax credit for E85 fuel and by providing automakers with a  100 tax credit for every E85 capable Flexible Fuel Vehicle  FFV  produced    Third  it would require the U S  government to lead by example and increase access to alternative fuels by requiring the government to allow public access to alternative fueling stations located on federal government property and by requiring that only clean buses be eligible for federal cost sharing  It would also create establish a Department of Defense  fly off competition  that would encourage private sector companies to compete to find the most energy efficient alternatives fuels for defense purposes    Finally  the legislation would create a Director of Energy Security to oversee and keep America focused on its goal of energy independence  The Director of Energy Security would serve as the principal advisor to the President  the National Security Council  the National Economic Council and the Homeland Security Council     This bill will help tilt our energy balance toward alternative fuels  moving these fuels into additional markets and making them more widely available for consumers   said Lugar   We believe that U S  national security will be served by more robust coordination of all the elements that contribute to energy security  Consequently  the bill also would establish the post of Director of Energy Security  who would answer to the President  Our policies should be targeted to replace hydrocarbons with carbohydrates  Obviously this is not a short term proposition  but we can off set a significant portion of demand for oil by giving American consumers a real choice of automotive fuel  We must end oil s near monopoly on the transportation sector  which accounts for 60 percent of American oil consumption  I am pleased to join Sen  Obama in promoting this legislation and appreciate his initiative in drafting it     Senator Obama said that while the reforms he and Senator Lugar have proposed will require sacrifice  they are attainable if America truly commits to the goal of energy independence    The President was absolutely correct when he said America is addicted to oil  but we can t continue to settle for piecemeal  bite sized solutions to our energy crisis   said Obama    We need a national commitment to energy security  Now is the time for serious leadership to get us started down the path of energy independence   The ideas Senator Lugar and I have proposed are bipartisan and common sense and would take an enormous step towards energy independence     Senator Richard Lugar is Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  Senator Obama is also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee as well as the Environment and Public Works Committee                                    ,1
1376,February 17  2005 Clinton  Schumer Call on FAA to Address Staff Deficiencies at Air Traffic Control Facilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    United States Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer today called on the Federal Aviation Administration to immediately address reports of staffing deficiencies at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control  NYTRACON  facility      It is imperative that our air traffic control facilities are adequately staffed so that we can ensure our air transportation system meets the tightest possible safety standards   We must carefully assess any budget tightening measure such as this one to be absolutely sure that safety is not negatively affected   Senator Clinton said         The air traffic controller system is in crisis   Everyone knows that   This new rule is shocking  we are squeezing the already invaluable resource   well trained experienced air traffic controllers   to the breaking point  There is no reason to set this arbitrary limit   It puts millions of traveler s lives in danger and I call on the FAA to stop it   said Senator Schumer      A copy of the Senators  letter to Administrator Blakey is below    February 16  2005   The Honorable Marion Blakey    Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20591   Dear Madam Administrator    We write regarding the current staffing crisis at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control  NYTRACON  facility   It is our understanding that the facility is staffed only at 77  and that recent policies enacted by the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  in which overtime has been curtailed is further exacerbating an already dangerous situation   We believe that the staffing situation poses a threat to the flying public and we ask for your immediate attention to the matter                 The NYTRACON has supplemented its staffing through the use of overtime which has allowed the facility to meet minimum operational requirements   However  on January 12  2005  the Acting Facility Manager issued a memorandum changing the policy for overtime approval   This is resulting in congested frequencies  an increase in operational errors  controller training being suspended  and safety being compromised                You stated in your Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan that   if the FAA is not able to adequately staff its air traffic control facilities  the system response will be observed in the area of system capacity not system safety    In 2004  while using overtime as a means to supplement staffing shortfalls  the overall operational error rate dropped by 10 percent   Yet  now only one month after the manager issued the new rule limiting the use of overtime  operational errors have started to mount                  While safety is the responsibility of all participants in the nation s air transportation system  the FAA s air traffic controller workforce manages millions of commercial  military  and general aviation aircraft operations daily   Because controllers face extreme pressure and stress every minute of their work day  the policies of the federal government must be consistent with easing that burden while meeting the demands of the flying public   Many facilities  especially the NY TRACON  require additional staffing but until full time hiring is complete  overtime is one of the few resources available to ease the mounting pressures on existing controllers                  We would appreciate a response from you on this specific issue as soon as possible as we are concerned about the increase in incidents since the beginning of 2005 and the potential for future issues as air traffic increases   If you  or your staff  have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Sean O Shea in Senator Clinton s office at  202  224 4451 or Joshua Vlasto in Senator Schumer s office at  202  224 4960   We thank you for your time and attention to this important matter    Sincerely                   Charles E  Schumer                                                 Hillary Rodham Clinton              ,0
1829,"FREEDOM FROM WANT
  Norman Rockwell painted Freedom from Want in 1943 while he lived in Arlington, Vt., a place the native New Yorker once likened to having ""fallen into Utopia."" ""The peaceful enclave of Arlington offered Rockwell a simpler, quieter life and the comfort and connection of a community of artists and writers,"" according to Resource Library Magazine. The painting for the Saturday Evening Post illustrated one of the ""Four Freedoms"" President Franklin D. Roosevelt propounded in his 1941 State of the Union address: Freedom from Want, Freedom of Speech, Freedom to Worship, and Freedom from Fear. This Thanksgiving Day, Americans counting their blessings might take a moment to remember that the United States has largest number of children living in poverty of any industrialized nation, a nation where the people on top are doing remarkably well while the vast majority struggle to maintain their standard of living. For too many Americans, Freedom from Want remains a goal.

263,   Obama  Bond Hail New Safeguards on Military Personality Disorder Discharges  Urge Further Action   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Bond Hail New Safeguards on Military Personality Disorder Discharges  Urge Further Action Monday  October  1  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                     Contact  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Shana Marchio  BOND    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Kit Bond  R MO  and Joseph Lieberman  ID CT  lauded the Senate   s inclusion of an amendment to limit the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges in the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill   This provision would add additional safeguards to discharge procedures and require a thorough review by the Government Accountability Office  GAO    According to recent reports  there have been some cases in which the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately used these procedures to discharge service members with service connected psychological injuries   Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time   This amendment is cosponsored by Senators Boxer  D CA   Lieberman  ID CT   McCaskill  D MO   Murray  D WA   Sanders  I VT  and Lincoln  D AR      With thousands of American service members suffering day in and day out from the less visible wounds of war  reports that the Pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service members with personality disorders are deeply disturbing     said Senator Obama      It means that those who have served this country aren   t getting the care they need to heal from injuries like PTSD or brain injuries  This provision will add additional safeguards to the Department of Defense   s use of this discharge and mandate a comprehensive review of these policies   This is an important first step and I will continue to fight for additional safeguards as well as the establishment of an independent review board to examine questionable cases in which service members were forced to fight a second war at home   Given our service members    courage and sacrifice for our country  it is our moral obligation to ensure that they receive the care and benefits they deserve        Many of our troops are returning from combat with injuries invisible to the eye but debilitating to them and their families    Unfortunately  many of these injuries have been ignored or worse  dismissed  for too long     said Kit Bond      Abuse of personality disorder discharges is inexcusable   This provision will force the Pentagon to stop using this discharge until we can fix the problem   It is critical that we treat our troops    battle wounds     whether physical or mental        We have no greater obligation than to ensure that our troops receive the care and benefits they deserve for their service to our country     said Senator Lieberman     I applaud the inclusion of this bipartisan amendment in the Senate   s Defense Authorization bill because the Pentagon must take immediate action to ensure that troops are being accurately diagnosed during their service and at discharge for both physical and mental injuries  This amendment will provide DoD with necessary safeguards  and take a closer look at what may be improper discharges of service members with mental health conditions   I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and the Pentagon on resolving any inequities in the system because our soldiers can afford no less     Recent reports suggest that in some cases the Department of Defense  DOD  has improperly and inconsistently used these procedures to discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs   Those discharges can result in the loss of healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt   Army studies have found that up to 30 percent of soldiers coming home from Iraq have suffered from depression  anxiety or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  A recent study found that those who have served multiple tours are 50 percent more likely to suffer from acute combat stress  The military has discharged more than 22 500 service members with for a  pre existing  personality disorder over the past six years  There are indications that some of these brave warriors may instead be suffering from combat related injuries like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injuries   This amendment mandates temporary safeguards on personality disorder discharges  including a high level review of cases before service members can be discharged  as well as a GAO review of the Department of Defense   s current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis    On June 21  2007  Obama joined Senator Bond  Boxer  Lieberman  McCaskill and

1946,"SANDERS PROPOSES $1 BILLION FOR HOME
  As Vermont dug out from the season's first major winter snow storm and temperatures plunged below freezing, emergency legislation to provide $1 billion for home heating assistance was introduced today in the Senate by Senators Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and in the House of Representatives by Congressman Peter Welch.
   ""Skyrocketing home heating bills already are stretching household budgets,"" Sanders said. ""In the richest country on earth, we have a moral responsibility to make sure that no one has to make a choice between food or medicine or heat for their homes. Congress must act now to deal with this national emergency."" 
   Leahy said, ""With the price of oil hovering near $100 per barrel, Vermonters are facing a 26 percent hike in their heating fuel bills this winter. The Bush administration is turning a blind eye to that harsh reality. Just three weeks ago President Bush vetoed $2.4 billion in LIHEAP help for struggling families. His veto has contributed to the looming emergency that this bill addresses.""
   ""Vermonters are getting squeezed,"" Welch said. ""The high cost of heating fuel is crippling family budgets and threatens the health and well-being of many of our neighbors already struggling to get by. It is critical that we provide this emergency assistance to Vermonters facing these exorbitant fuel costs.""
   The Keep Americans Warm Act of 2007 would provide an additional $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program this winter, when home heating bills for a typical household burning heating oil are projected to total $2,157, a 47 percent increase from last winter. The National Energy Directors Association estimated propane prices will set the typical household back $1,765 this winter, 31 percent more than one year ago. Electricity will cost 9 percent more; and natural gas prices were projected to go up by more than 9 percent.
   The number of households receiving home heating assistance under the federal and state partnership program increased by 26 percent from 4.6 million in 2003 to about 5.8 million in 2007. During the same period, federal support for the program went up by only 10 percent. As a result, the average grant declined from $349 to $305 while energy prices continued to rise. The result has been a significant decrease in the program's purchasing power.
   According to the energy assistance directors, states plan to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding. The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5.8 million in 2007 to 4.9 million during the coming year.
   Incredibly, President Bush wants to slash $379 million from the program that provides critical help to 5.8 million senior citizens on fixed-incomes and low-income families with children, including approximately 20,000 households in Vermont.
   The Sanders bill has strong bipartisan backing from 23 Senate cosponsors. Welch lined up 12 cosponsors in the House.
   The Senate cosponsors are Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Joseph R. Biden, D-Del.; Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.; Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa.; Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y.; Norm Coleman. R-Minn.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; John F. Kerry, D-Mass.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Patrick J.

Smith, R-Ore.; Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine; John E. Sununu, R-N.H., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich.
   The House cosponsors are Thomas Allen, D-Maine; Joe Courtney, D-Conn.; Donna Christensen, D-Virgin Islands; Keith Ellison, D-Minn.; Phil Hare, D-Ill.; Paul Hodes, D-N.H.; Michael Michaud, D-Maine; Gwen Moore, D-Wis.; Donald Payne, D-N.J.; Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H.; Mike Ross, D-Ark., and Albert Wynn, D-Md.

1744,"SEN. SANDERS: WE NEED TROOPS TO DEVELOP NEW STRATEGY FOR FIGHTING SERIOUS PROBLEM OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM
  There has been good news from Washington, like well-deserved support in Congress for America's veterans and the biggest increase in grants and loans for college students since the GI Bill. And just this week, the Senate approved $7 million more for repairing Vermont bridges and passed a Sanders-Leahy Amendment that restored more than $181,000 for public housing authorities in Vermont. Those and other accomplishments have been overshadowed by all the bad news coming out of Iraq and a president bent on continuing the war he misled us into more than four years ago. ""He is still misleading us,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said.  
   ""Bush's 'troop withdrawal' will leave us with as many troops in Iraq as we had before the 'surge' troop buildup - about 130,000. Even more importantly, this president has no idea how to end this war. Bush's advisors concede that this war, already longer than WWII, could go on for another five to 10 years. This is unacceptable. We need to bring our troops home and develop a new and more effective strategy for fighting the very serious problem of international terrorism."" Senator Sanders will discuss his views on the war and other topics when he is the guest on Vermont Public Radio's ""Vermont Edition"" at noon on Friday To participate in the program, you may email questions here or during the show call 1-800-639-2211.To listen live online visit at:

1783,"PATRIOTS VS. GIANTS
  Vermont's congressional delegation asked the National Football League to broadcast the Dec. 29 New England Patriots-New York Giants game in Vermont. The season finale may be seen in Boston and New York for free, but not in most of Vermont, where fans are caught in the middle of a fight between the football league and cable television industry. ""What we now have are two very powerful and wealthy special interests, the NFL and the cable companies, squabbling over who is going to be making more money out of this game,"" Sanders said. 
   ""Years ago the federal government gave the NFL an exemption from certain anti-trust laws and taxpayers have helped build football stadiums all across the country. In exchange, shouldn't we expect that loyal fans are able to see games like this on normal broadcast channels or the most basic tier of cable service? I really don't think that's asking so much.
   ""Right now the cable companies and the NFL are blaming each other when in reality they are both to blame. This is a problem that is happening all over the country and I think it shows that unless this problem is worked out soon, Congress may need to step in reexamine what kind of protections the NFL deserves and what kind of new regulations we may need to impose on them and the cable companies.
   While, perhaps, not one of the major issues facing humanity, a lot of Vermonters and football fans across the country are going to be disappointed if they miss one of the big games of the regular NFL season.

361,   Durbin  Obama  IL Delegation Members Urge President Bush to Provide Federal Assistance to Fifteen Southern Illinois Counties   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Durbin  Obama  IL Delegation Members Urge President Bush to Provide Federal Assistance to Fifteen Southern Illinois Counties Friday  May 23  2008  For Immediate Release   Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Additional damage discovered after original request for assistance was denied WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today asked President Bush to declare fifteen southern Illinois counties federal disaster areas after severe flooding hit the area in March  The Illinois Senators were joined by Congressmen Jerry Costello  D IL   Tim Johnson  R IL  and John Shimkus  R IL  in their support of Governor Rod Blagojevich s appeal of the President s April 28 denial of a request for federal assistance for the following counties  Alexander  Franklin  Gallatin  Jackson  Jefferson  Johnson  Marion  Massac  Perry  Pulaski  Randolph  Saline  Union  White and Williamson   As a result of the denial of federal assistance  the Illinois Emergency Agency  IEMA  requested a second Preliminary Damage Assessment  PDA  which found additional damage to residences in four of the 15 counties that were included in Blagojevich s original request for Federal assistance   In all  the storm destroyed 64 homes and damaged more than 300 homes    Additional resources are badly needed in communities throughout Illinois that have been stretched to the limit in recent months   said Durbin    I am glad to join with my colleagues in Congress and in supporting Governor Blagojevich s request for federal funding that will allow these communities to fully recover from the storms    Illinoisans affected by the destructive flooding in March deserve federal relief to rebuild as quickly as possible   said Senator Obama   Fifteen counties in my home state endured significant damage  and we must ensure these families and businesses have the resources to recover   I strongly urge the President to reconsider his denial of federal assistance for those who are struggling to rebuild their lives    The federal disaster declaration was originally requested on April 8 as a result of severe flooding that began on March 17   The storm and floodwaters destroyed 39 homes and damaged more than 500 homes and 145 businesses   Further damage to roads  bridges  water control facilities and other public infrastructure have been reported although the full extent cannot be measured until the waters recede and local governments can conduct an initial assessment  If the state s request for federal assistance is approved  communities could apply for Individual Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Assistance   Individual Assistance includes aid to individuals and households which can include cash grants to help with temporary housing  home repairs and replacement  and other disaster related costs   Hazard Mitigation Assistance includes funding for measures designed to reduce future losses to public and private property    Hazard mitigation opportunities are assessed in most situations  Additionally  small business administration loans can be provided under an  SBA disaster assistance  declaration by the SBA Administrator even if the President denies the major disaster declaration and includes three types of loans to qualified homeowners and businesses   home disaster loans to homeowners and renters  business physical disaster loans to business owners and economic injury disaster loans to small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives   A federal disaster declaration includes SBA assistance under the Individual Assistance program at FEMA   text of letter below May 23  2008 The Honorable George W  Bush  The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500 Dear Mr  President  We write to support Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich s request for a federal disaster declaration for fifteen counties in southern Illinois as a result of flooding beginning March 17  2008   Governor Blagojevich declared these counties state disaster areas on March 20  2008  Severe storms in late March produced extremely heavy rain and flooding in Alexander  Franklin  Gallatin  Jackson  Jefferson  Johnson  Marion  Massac  Perry  Pulaski  Randolph  Saline  Union  White  and Williamson Counties   As a result of the denial of federal assistance to aid residents in southern Illinois  it was necessary for the Illinois Emergency Agency  IEMA  to request a second Preliminary Damage Assessment  PDA   which was completed on May 21  2008  by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA    This PDA was able to verify the extent of damage to those homes that were inaccessible in April due to standing flood water in three counties since the initial PDA   According to the additional information from the second PDA  the storm s damage assessment has increased   In all  the storm destroyed 64 homes and damaged more than 300 homes  and it continues to present a disaster recovery situation that is beyond the capability of the State and affected local governments   Flood waters have also damaged roads  bridges  water control facilities  and other public infrastructure  which was discovered after the water receded  This is the fourth flood event for Illinois in the last year that has warranted federal disaster assistance   Constant flooding has exhausted the resources of many of the local governments affected by the most recent storms   We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of these fifteen counties can receive federal disaster assistance   The flooded area in the fifteen counties has a population that is 45 percent low income  and federal assistance through the programs administered by FEMA will help them to recover from this devastating flood   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request and stand ready to assist in any way appropriate  Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin        United States Senator                                                                      Barack Obama  United States Senator

1982,"SEN. SANDERS WILL HOLD SERIES OF TOWN MEETINGS TRAVELING ACROSS VERMONT
  Senator Bernie Sanders is traveling across Vermont this week holding a series of town meetings. About 200 people attended ""Brunch with Bernie"" on Sunday in South Burlington, where the senator told reporters, ""The reason that I like doing these events is that it's important for me to hear what is on peoples' minds."" He added, ""It's amazing how often you learn things that you did not know."" Summing up events in Washington, Sanders said, ""The good news is, we passed a higher education funding bill which is the most important legislation to make college affordable that we have seen in many, many decades. That's a step forward. I think you're going to see the largest increase in funding for the Veterans Administration."" On Monday, he traveled to the Northeast Kingdom for a town meeting in St. Johnsbury that focused on economic issues. Global warming was the issue of the day on Tuesday, when he was slated to host a town meeting at the University of Vermont. The senator is headed to St. Albans on Wednesday to meet with Department of Homeland Security workers.

1330,November 16  2006 Kennedy  Schumer  Clinton Join Leaders and Activists to Celebrate State Minimum Wage Wins and Fight for Federal Increase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Moving America Forward Begins with a Higher Minimum Wage Washington  DC   Today Senators Kennedy  Schumer  and Clinton joined leaders and activists from the six states that passed minimum wage initiatives to affirm their commitment to raising the federal minimum wage   Last week  the citizens of Arizona  Colorado  Montana  Missouri  Nevada and Ohio voted overwhelmingly in support of raising the minimum wage            The leaders and activists that helped make that happen joined the senators to convey the strong desire that people have across the country to give hard working Americans the raise they deserve   Kennedy  s bill to raise the minimum wage from  5 15 to  7 25 is a top priority for the new Democratic Senate in the 110th Congress             America has spoken  and the new Congress will listen   If there  s one message from this election that emerged loud and clear on a domestic issue  it  s raise the minimum wage   No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty      Senator Kennedy said              The success of these ballot initiatives and the wave of support across the country prove without a doubt that a raise in the minimum wage is long overdue   Senator Schumer said   Families barely making it by on the minimum wage are worried about putting food on the table  skyrocketing prices at the pump  rising tuition costs  and making sure their loved ones are healthy and safe  These families shouldn t have had to wait for nearly a decade to receive a raise and in January their wait will finally come to an end              American voters have made a statement at the polls  working families struggling to make ends meet deserve better   After 10 long years since Congress increased the minimum wage  the new Democratic led Congress will soon deliver on its promise to the American people     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said             For too long  leaders in control of Congress neglected the needs of working Americans     said AFL CIO President John Sweeney     Last Tuesday  working people said no to business as usual   Our new leaders have a mandate for change and they should start by giving a raise to the people who need it most America  s lowest paid workers                On Election Day  voters in Missouri and across the country sent a clear message to Washington  DC  It is time to address the needs and concerns of working families     said Lenny Jones  SEIU Missouri State Council Director for the Give Missourians a Raise Campaign Manager              On November 7th the voters spoke  and they believe hard work deserves fair pay   The new Congress should listen and raise the federal minimum wage as soon as they get to work     said Alicia Russe Alicia Russell  member of Arizona ACORN  Chair of AZ ACORNs Political Action Committee  and leader in the successful ballot campaign to raise Arizona s minimum wage            Below are details of Senator Kennedy  s Minimum Wage Bill               Raising the Minimum Wage is a Matter of Fairness       Senator Kennedy  s Fair Minimum Wage Act would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour in three steps               5 85 60 days after enactment            6 55 one year later            7 25 one year after that        The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 5 4 million since President Bush took office  37 million people live in poverty  including 13 million children  Among full time  year round workers  poverty has increased by 50 percent since the late 1970s           An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key part of the problem           Minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year earn  10 700 per year  almost  6 000 below the federal poverty guidelines of  16 600 for a family of three  Since then the minimum wage was last raised in 1997  its real value has eroded by 21 3 percent             Every day the minimum wage is not increased  it continues to lose value  and workers fall farther and farther behind  Minimum wage workers have already lost all of the gains of the 1996 1997 increase           Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 00 below what it was in 1968   To have the purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour today  not  5 15            Nearly fifteen million Americans will benefit from a minimum wage increase to  7 25 an hour    6 6 million directly  and another 8 3 million indirectly   Fifty nine percent of these workers are women  and forty percent are people of color           Eighty percent of those who would benefit are adult workers  not teenagers seeking pocket change  Fifty four percent of workers who will benefit are full time employees  and more than a third of these adults are sole breadwinners for their families             Increasing the minimum wage will help more than 7 3 million children whose parents would receive a raise              Raising the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour will mean an additional  4 400 a year to help minimum wage earners support their families   It would be enough money for a low income family of three to buy            15 months of groceries            19 months of utilities            8 months of rent            Over two years of health care            20 months of child care            30 months of college tuition at a public  2 year college        This year  the Senate raised its pay by  3 100 and is set to receive an additional  3 300 raise in 2007   It is shameful that Members of Congress received our eighth pay increase in nine years  yet we have not provided a single pay increase to the lowest paid workers             The salaries of lawmakers have gone up by  31 600 since 1997  while minimum wage workers continue to earn just  10 700 a year           History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation   In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades   Nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 248 000 per month     In contrast  in the last four years  the minimum wage has held steady  but only 4 9 million jobs have been created           States across this country have raised their own minimum wages without adverse economic consequences   Study after study has shown that raising the minimum wage has not cost jobs in the states  An Economic Policy Institute study of Washington  Oregon  and Alaska showed that increases in the state minimum wage had no impact on the state unemployment rate   Similarly  the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center has found that after the last two minimum wage increases in Massachusetts in 2000 and 2001  employment grew more quickly in sectors with the most minimum wage workers  including leisure  hospitality  and the service sector           A recent Gallup poll found that 86  of small business owners do not think that the minimum wage affects their business  and three out of four small businesses said that a 10  increase in the minimum wage would have no effect on their company  Additionally  nearly half of small business owners think that the minimum wage should be increased  and only 16  of owners think the minimum wage should be reduced or eliminated entirely           Britain has the second largest economy in Europe  after Germany    They implemented a minimum wage in 1999 that has had no adverse employment effects  and has lifted 1 8 million British children out of poverty   They raised their minimum wage to about  9 51 per hour last year  and they are planning to raise this rate to about  9 89 in October of this year           Ireland has an extremely robust economy  with impressive growth over the last decade  and the fourth largest GDP per capita in the world   The minimum wage rate in Ireland is 7 65  hour  about  9 65  and yet their unemployment rate is lower than the U S          ,0

1902,"SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST BUSH ADMINISTRATION ON GLOBAL WARMING
  In a rebuke to Bush administration policies on global warming, the Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 that the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from cars.  
   Vermont and other states that mounted the legal challenge called global warming ""the most pressing environmental challenge of our time."" In a second case, the court unanimously vacated a lower court ruling for Duke Energy in a dispute over pollution permits. 
   ""Even with its very conservative makeup, the Supreme Court sent a loud and clear message to the Bush administration that the EPA can no longer bury its head in the sand and ignore global warming,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). ""This is a one-two punch against the Bush administration and for the environment."" 
   Sanders and Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, are sponsors of the most far-reaching legislation to combat global warming. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is a cosponsor of the bill. 
   The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act calls for a reduction of emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. 
   Former Vice President Al Gore, a leading figure in the fight against global warming, recently testified before Congress that the Sanders-Boxer bill is ""an excellent piece of legislation.""

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor  202  228 5511  Reid Contact  Jim Manley or Rebecca Kirszner  202  224 2939  Date  October 4  2006  Senators Criticize Bush Administration   s Failure to Monitor Communications of Deadly Terrorists in U S  Custody   WASHINGTON     In a letter to President Bush  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D NV  and Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today said that the Administration   s failure to monitor the communications of deadly terrorists already in U S  captivity calls into question the ability of this Administration to conduct the intelligence operations required to effectively fight terrorism    In a report released yesterday  the Department of Justice Inspector General  IG  Glenn Fine concluded that    the  Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP has not ensured that mail for terrorist and other high risk inmates on its monitoring lists is consistently read and analyzed to detect terrorism  criminal activities  or other inappropriate behavior     As a result  according to the IG report     the threat remains that terrorist and other high risk inmates can use mail and verbal communications to conduct terrorist or criminal activities while incarcerated       In their letter  the Senators said     The failure to monitor the communications of these deadly terrorists already in captivity calls into question the Bush Administration   s ability to wage an effective war on terror and competently conduct intelligence operations that are crucial to keeping our nation safe       The Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP  is supposed to carefully screen 100  of mail sent and received by high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists  When the mail is in a foreign language  the BOP is expected to have the mail reviewed and translated by someone fluent in that language   The BOP is also supposed to monitor verbal communications of convicted terrorists over the telephone  in visiting rooms  and in the cellblock     But the report found that these communications are rarely if ever monitored  and that BOP officials are lacking the resources and training required to do their jobs    Some of the most troubling conclusion in the report include   The BOP did not hire any full time Arabic language specialists to translate inmate communications until 2005     four years after the 9 11 attacks   At one federal prison  only 0 3  of mail for all inmates was randomly screened by BOP staff   At one federal prison  the three FBI agents responsible for terrorism matters were not even aware that there were two inmates at the prison who were incarcerated for international terrorism crimes     Below please find the full text of the letter    October 4  2006   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear President Bush     We are writing to express our serious concerns about your Administration   s failure to monitor all mail to and from convicted terrorists in federal prisons   Your Administration   s disregard for this basic surveillance obligation leaves our nation at grave risk    As you know  the Federal Bureau of Prisons  BOP  is supposed to carefully screen 100  of mail sent and received by high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists   When the mail is in a foreign language  the BOP is expected to have the mail reviewed and translated by someone fluent in that language   The BOP is also supposed to monitor the verbal communications of convicted terrorists over the telephone  in visiting rooms  and in the cellblock     These screening requirements are intended to address the real threat posed by terrorists in our prisons   For instance  in March 2005  news reports indicated that three convicted terrorists at the federal penitentiary in Florence  Colorado  who were imprisoned for the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center had written approximately 90 letters to Islamic extremists between 2002 and 2004   Some of these letters were written to members of a Spanish terror cell with links to terrorists suspected in the March 2004  train bombings in Madrid    However  in a report released yesterday  the Department of Justice Inspector General  IG  Glenn Fine concluded that    the BOP has not ensured that mail for terrorist and other high risk inmates on its monitoring lists is consistently read and analyzed to detect terrorism  criminal activities  or other inappropriate behavior      As a result  according to the IG report     the threat remains that terrorist and other high risk inmates can use mail and verbal communications to conduct terrorist or criminal activities while incarcerated        The failure to monitor the communications of these deadly terrorists already in captivity calls into question your ability to wage an effective war on terror and competently conduct intelligence operations that are crucial to keeping our nation safe    Among the report   s findings are the following    At 7 of the 10 prisons surveyed by the IG  the amount of mail involving convicted terrorists that was monitored has decreased since FY 2005 because of BOP cost cutting initiatives   At one federal prison  only 0 3  of mail for all inmates was randomly screened by BOP staff    The BOP did not hire any full time Arabic language specialists to translate inmate communications until 2005     four years after the 9 11 attacks     The first group of Arabic language specialists hired by BOP received no counterterrorism intelligence training during their first year of employment that would help them analyze the mail they were reading    At one prison  only 3 out of 1 385  0 2   of calls involving high risk inmates  including convicted terrorists  were monitored during the month of August 2005   The prison also housed organized crime figure John Gotti  Jr   who was awaiting trial for kidnapping and racketeering  and none of his 50 phone calls during that month were monitored    The BOP did not audio record the social visits of terrorist inmates  and according to the IG report     the BOP may be missing opportunities to detect terrorist or criminal activity       There is wide variation in the amount of information shared between the BOP and FBI regarding terrorist inmates   At one federal prison  the three FBI agents responsible for terrorism matters were not even aware that there were two inmates who were incarcerated for international terrorism crimes   The prison staff at another facility learned from a news article  rather than the FBI  that an international terrorist housed at their prison was a high ranking member of al Qaeda and had trained to be a bodyguard for Osama bin Laden    We urge you to take immediate action to ensure that the Bureau of Prisons remedies this serious security failure   In the War on Terror  there is no excuse for any agency to allow terrorist activity in its midst   The Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons must stop convicted terrorists from engaging in terrorist communications    We ask that you respond by October 13  2006  as to the steps that you are taking to address this problem   Thank you    Sincerely    Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  Senator Barack Obama                                    ,1
1106,February 14  2007 Senator Clinton and Congressman McHugh Urge Department of Agriculture to Fix Fish Import Rule that is Hurting Upstate New York Business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congressman John M  McHugh  R NY  are urging the United States Department of Agriculture s  USDA  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  to fix a rule that is severely impacting Thousand Islands Fishery  a local fish importer in Alexandria Bay  NY           In October of last year  APHIS issued a federal emergency order immediately prohibiting the importation of 37 species of live fish from two Canadian provinces to contain the spread of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia  VHS    VHS is a pathogen of fresh and saltwater fish  and is causing an emerging disease in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada  In a letter sent to APHIS Administrator Dr  Ron DeHaven  Clinton and McHugh both indicated their complete support for efforts to combat the spread of VHS and other invasive species  but said they believed that an exception could be made for fish that was taken from Canada for immediate processing and sale to restaurants  which would pose no threat to local waterways           There is no question that we must protect New York s lakes and streams  but the recent fish import ban goes too far in some cases and is hurting New York businesses   said Senator Clinton   I urge the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to act as quickly as possible to allow our North Country businesses to resume importing fish for uses that do not pose a threat to the health of New York s fisheries            While safeguarding the species in America s lakes and rivers is important  this is a prime example of federal regulations having unintended consequences   said Congressman McHugh    In this case  the rule is putting the livelihoods of small business owners at risk and it is imperative that federal officials expedite the process and issue an amended ruling on this matter           The letter explains the importance of certain species of fish  in particular Brown Bullhead  that are critical to the livelihood of small businesses like Thousand Islands Fishery  Importation of this type of fish from Canada for immediate processing and sale to restaurants presents a minimal risk of the spread of VHS  An interim ruling could lift the ban on importation of Brown Bullheads from Canada and include mechanisms to ensure that imports are properly tracked and handled in order to make sure that the imports did not result in the spread of VHS         The full text of the letter sent to Dr  DeHaven is below       Dr  Ron DeHaven  Administrator  U S  Department of Agriculture  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  1400 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20250      Dear Dr  DeHaven       We write in regards to the recent regulatory actions taken by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  to contain the spread of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia  VHS    While we support APHIS efforts to combat the spread of VHS and other animals and diseases that threaten the Great Lakes and many smaller New York water bodies  we are very concerned that this particular action may be unnecessarily affecting a New York fish importer          On October 24  2006  APHIS issued a federal emergency order immediately prohibiting the importation of 37 species of live fish susceptible to VHS from two Canadian provinces into the United States   The order also stopped interstate movement of the same species among the eight states bordering the Great Lakes  and is impacting New York businesses   We are particularly concerned about the impact of this order on New York businesses that import Brown Bullhead from Canada for processing and sale to restaurants          It is our understanding that importation of this type of fish from Canada for immediate processing and sale to restaurants presents a minimal risk of the spread of VHS   As a result  we understand that APHIS intends to lift the ban on importation of these fish as soon as the emergency order can be replaced with an interim rule that includes mechanisms to ensure that imports are properly tracked and handled   Imports are critical because there is no commercial fishery for this species in New York   The season for this fish will soon begin  and the survival of a small New York business may depend on a speedy resolution of this issue   We urge you to move as quickly as possible to issue an interim rule that will both allow imports of these fish and protect the Great Lakes and New York waters from the spread of VHS          We appreciate your consideration of our concerns and look forward to your reply          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  John M  McHugh         ,0
1399,March 17  2005 Clinton Praises Passage of Gear Up Trio Amendment  to Restore Cuts to Vital College Access Programs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today praised the passage of an amendment she co sponsored to provide  773 7 million to restore the President s cuts to GEAR UP and TRIO  including  306 5 million for GEAR UP and  467 2 million for TRIO  Upward Bound   312 556 million  Talent Search   144 887 million  and other TRIO cut   9 710 million   This amendment restores college access services to over 1 8 million low income and first generation middle and high school students  including nearly 40 000 New York students          If this amendment had not passed  New York could have lost  24 million in vital education resources  The combined effects of these cuts would have had a far reaching impact on the academic and future success of nearly 40 000 at risk students across New York State  I am glad that the Senate took action to restore the cuts and we will continue to fight against any Bush Administration attempt to undermine these critical programs   said Senator Clinton         New York received nearly  6 million in GEAR UP funds in fiscal year 2005  President Bush s budget would eliminate this funding and cut services to more than 20 086 GEAR UP students across the State  The President s budget also slashes TRIO funding in New York by 50   which results in an  18 million cut to New York TRIO programs and eliminates services to more than 19 000 students in Upward Bound and Talent Search         If it were up to the President  the progress that we ve made in addressing the cultural  social  and economic barriers that limit college access for so many low income and minority students would have been halted through his cuts  We should be doing all that we can to help disadvantaged students get on the path to college  not limiting their chances for success   said Senator Clinton          These programs were on the President s chopping block despite the fact that far too many low income and minority students attend schools that have less demanding curricula  less qualified teachers and counselors  and fewer financial resources  The President s budget proposal is a deliberate attempt to leave these children behind  especially considering the large gaps in college enrollment and completion that exist for these students   said Senator Clinton         Of high school graduates  those from high income families enter college at rates 25 percentage points higher than those from low income families  By their late 20s  more than one third of Whites have at least a bachelor s degree  but only 18 percent of African Americans and 10 percent of Hispanics have attained degrees  GEAR UP and TRIO programs provide these students with critical information about college admissions and financial aid and prepare these students to enter and succeed in college         Last year  Senator Clinton sent a letter urging the Senate Appropriations Committee to increase funding for GEAR UP which was signed by 20 Senators         GEAR UP  which stands for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs  is a bipartisan  public private education partnership created by Congress during the Clinton Administration  GEAR UP unites the entire community in a responsive  creative effort to get entire classrooms of low income children ready for higher education  guiding them from middle school all the way through college admission  The TRIO Talent Search and Upward Bound programs were created in the mid 1960s as part of the War on Poverty  Talent Search programs provide young people in grades six through 12 with counseling  information about college admissions requirements  scholarships and various student financial aid programs  Upward Bound helps young students prepare for higher education through instruction in literature  composition  mathematics  science on college campuses after school  on Saturdays and during the summer          ,0
238,   Durbin and Obama Unsatisfied with VA Response   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Durbin and Obama Unsatisfied with VA Response Friday  October 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama  or Christina Mulka  Durbin  WASHINGTON  DC     Unsatisfied with the answers that the Department of Veteran   s Affairs  VA  provided in response to two letters  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today called on the Acting Secretary of the VA  Gordon Mansfield  to respond to new information that has come to light regarding patient safety and the quality of care at the Marion VA Medical Center  While asking follow up questions to the response that they received from the VA  the Illinois members expressed their view that any concerns over health care quality at the facility must be immediately addressed  On August 31  the Department of Veterans Affairs suspended all inpatient surgeries at the medical center due to an unusual increase in deaths  Four top hospital officials have been reassigned until an Inspector General investigation is completed  During the investigations  questions have arose about a surgeon  Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who was allowed to practice medicine at the facility until August 2007 despite having to surrender his license in Massachusetts after numerous cases of malpractice  The VA   s responses followed two letters that Senators Durbin and Obama sent looking into a spike in deaths at the VA Medical Center in Marion  Illinois  The first letter was sent on September 17 to Secretary Nicholson asking for more information on the ongoing investigation  In the letter  they also sought assurances that the travel and scheduling needs of any veterans who must now be redirected to other facilities to receive their needed surgeries will be facilitated  The second letter was sent to Jim Nicholson  who was serving as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  on September 24 asking specific questions about the VA   s response to the increase in deaths at the center  They also asked why Dr  Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August  The text of the letter appears below  October 18  2007   The Honorable Gordon Mansfield   Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs  U S  Department of Veterans Affairs   810 Vermont Ave   NW   Washington  DC 20420   Dear Secretary Mansfield  Thank you for your response to our offices dated October 12  2007  While we appreciate the timeliness of your reply  the letter raised more questions than it answered  We are therefore writing to request additional answers and clarifications to your responses to our original letters and to ask that you respond to new information that has come to light regarding health care quality and patient safety at the Marion VA Medical Center  VAMC   We respectfully request answers to the following questions  1  How many fatal and non fatal patient safety events have occurred at the Marion VAMC since the beginning of 2006  Specifically  for all surgeries conducted at the Marion VAMC since the beginning of calendar year 2006 through September 2007  please provide figures broken out by quarter and attending physician on the following  a  Actual and expected rates of post operative infection and other  surgical complications  and death   b  Actual and expected average lengths of hospitalization   c  Actual and expected rates of hospital readmission within 30 days  d  Citations from JCAHO and other accreditation and licensing entities  and e  Other relevant indicators of surgical care quality  2  You reported that over the period between April 1 and September 1  2007  there were 36 hospital deaths at the Marion VAMC  To the extent allowable under HIPAA  please elaborate on the reasons for hospitalization  causes of death and how many of these deaths were unexpected  How many of these deaths involved Dr  Veizaga Mendez  3  You provided comparative data that implied that the frequency of deaths between April 1 and September 1  2007  was within normal bounds for the VA  Yet you have previously described there being a    spike    in deaths during this time period  What data or evidence led you to believe there was a spike  4  You reported that  at the time of Dr  Veizaga Mendez    original appointment  VA    made a query of the National Practitioner Data Bank Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank  NPDB HIPDB      Please provide documentation of your query and the information obtained as a result of that query  Was any information returned that would give the VA a reasonable cause for concern in allowing Dr  Veizaga Mendez to care for veterans  5  Please provide any material regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez you received from the Massachusetts Medical Board during the time he was under consideration for employment at the Marion VAMC as well as any materials or notifications received from the Massachusetts Medical Board while he was employed at the Marion VAMC  Specifically  did the information provided by the Massachusetts Medical Board describe two malpractice payments  one each in 2004 and 2005  made by Dr  Veizaga Mendez and a record of the hospital disciplinary action taken against Dr  Veizaga Mendez in 2004  If not  why was that material not made available to the VA since those actions were already final when Marion VAMC allegedly requested information from the Massachusetts Medical Board  6  As part of their credentialing processes  many hospitals require doctors to answer written questions regarding past charges or claims filed  Did the VA pose such questions to Dr  Veizaga Mendez as part of his VA application  and if so  a  What were the specific questions VA asked of Dr  Veizaga Mendez   b  What were Dr  Veizaga Mendez    answers to these questions   c  Does any of the information he provided conflict with known information about charges or claims related to his practice in Massachusetts  In addition  did the VA contact Dr  Veizaga Mendez   s former employers and former hospitals at which he held clinical privileges in Massachusetts  And if so  did any of the information obtained in those instances provide cause for concern regarding Dr  Veizaga Mendez  Please provide copies of the five written letters of reference that you obtained  7  In describing the VA   s general approach to conducting background checks on medical hires  you reported that the VA Health Administration    also checks the names of all applicants against a Federal list of individuals who have been excluded from participation in any Federal health care programs     Did the VA perform such a check on Dr  Veizaga Mendez and what were the results  What procedures does the VA have in place to ensure that all VA facilities perform such checks when hiring new health care professionals  Our offices have received at least one new complaint involving a veteran who may have sustained a life altering injury in a VA facility as a direct result of a preventable medical error  Our offices are working closely with the family to ensure this individual gets the help and benefits he deserves  This new case  which we are sharing with the Office of the Inspector General  is all the more troubling because it involved a second physician  and not Dr  Veizaga Mendez  This case     and we are concerned there may be others like it     suggests that the problem with health care quality  particularly patient safety  may be more widespread than previously believed  Underscoring this concern is the account from the veteran   s mother that one health professional at the Marion VAMC went so far as to warn her to take her son elsewhere for care  suggesting that concerns over the quality of health care were well known among at least some of the hospital   s staff  This raises the question as to whether this concern was known by the VA   s leadership  Obviously this case must be reviewed and verified  but we expect that you would agree that  given the situation  this case raises serious concerns that must be addressed  8  Does the VA believe that the problems with patient safety and patient care extend beyond the problems associated with Dr  Veizaga Mendez and the other three Marion staff that have been reassigned  Was the leadership of the VA aware of other allegations of poor patient care and lax patient safety  And what steps has the VA taken to ensure that health care quality and patient safety are at the highest levels at all VA facilities nationwide  We want to underscore our belief that the majority of VA health staff perform their jobs with exceptional competence and compassion on a daily basis  They deserve our praise for their dedication and patriotism  and we know that Marion is proud that its VA facility serves veterans across the region  At the same time  Marion residents share our view that any concerns over health care quality at this VA facility must be immediately addressed  We know that you are committed to investigating and remedying quality and patient safety issues  and to preventing similar occurrences at Marion and other VA health facilities around the country  Thank you for responding to our request by October 26  2007  Sincerely    Richard Durbin  United States Senator   Barack Obama  United States Senator                                  ,1

1766,"SEN. SANDERS URGES REMOVAL OF BORDER BOTTLENECKS
  Citing ""deep concerns"" about long delays crossing the border separating the United States and Canada, Senator Bernie Sanders urged Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to ""come to Vermont and take action to put an end to this absolutely unacceptable situation."" The senator also established a committee of Vermont state and local officials, law enforcement authorities, business owners and others affected by increasing border crossing problems.  
   In a letter to the Homeland Security Department secretary, Sanders cited inexcusable delays of up to three hours at some vehicle checkpoints. ""While we all agree that we must secure our borders, we also need to ensure that we have in place a procedure that allows for the timely and efficient processing of customs and immigration checks,"" Sanders wrote to Chertoff. ""The current situation is simply unacceptable."" 
   Part of the problem, the senator added, is that at major Vermont border checkpoints some traffic lanes are closed due to a serious shortage of border patrol agents. ""The resulting back up of vehicles and people has a profound effect on commerce and tourism, in addition to other economic repercussions,"" Sanders told Chertoff. 
   Border crossing problems were discussed last week at town meetings Sanders hosted in Lyndon and St. Albans, two of several Vermont Listening Sessions held throughout the state. ""We have a border crossing crisis that could unhinge the Vermont economy and it's coming at us very fast,"" Bill Stenger, president of Jay Peak Resort told the senator. 
   Sanders also was contacted by a citizens committee made up of residents from the border community of Derby Line, Vt., and Stanstead, Quebec. In addition to long waits to cross the border, the letter said, ""Residents from both sides of the line are being alienated and are made to feel like criminals."" The committee described ""an intolerable situation"" that it said ""is killing business on both sides of the line."" For example, what used to be a 15-minute trip to a grocery store in Stanstead now takes an hour or more. Drivers endure lines lasting half an hour or more for what used to be a two-minute trip from the Canadian town to a gas station in Derby Line.

1917,"BILLIONS FOR COAL AND CARS, SILENCE ON SOLAR AND WIND
  A global warming bill that a Senate panel is scheduled to take up on Thursday carves out $324 billion for the coal industry and $232 billion for car makers. There's not a nickel carved out for solar power, wind energy, geothermal or other alternative energy sources. ""This is a rather extraordinary omission,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the subcommittee that will consider compromise legislation drafted by Senators Joseph Lieberman and John Warner.
   ""The Lieberman-Warner global warming bill is a major step forward in moving Congress toward addressing the crisis of global warming. I applaud both senators for their hard work and look forward to continue working with them as we make this bill stronger,"" Sanders said. 
   ""The bill in its current form does not go far enough if we are going to be successful in protecting this planet for our children and grandchildren. Global warming can no longer be seen as a political issue. It is about responding to the physics and chemistry of climate change. It is about responding to the scientists who are telling us that the problem is even more urgent than they thought a few short years ago.
   ""As I indicated at the hearing on the bill last week, I have serious concerns about a number of provisions in the bill. These include the level of greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2020, the time in which the legislation transits to 100 percent auction or public benefit, and the need for enforceable 'look back' provisions that would result in the carbon caps becoming even tighter if the latest science tells us we are not achieving the necessary goals.
   ""There is another major concern that I have which has, to this point, received very little attention. And that is exactly who benefits from the trillions of dollars that this bill distributes through the auction and the allocation process.
   ""According to a preliminary analysis by Friends of the Earth, a major environmental organization, over the 38 year period covered by the bill the coal industry would receive a carve-out of more than $324 billion for efforts associated with ""advanced coal and sequestration."" This is an extraordinary sum of money to an industry given the reality that there is currently not one advanced coal plant in operation that is sequestering all or most of its carbon emissions, and there are serious questions about the long-term environmental and cost-effectiveness of that technology.
   ""On the other hand, while $324 billion of the auction proceeds is being handed to the coal industry, there are no funds specifically carved out in the bill for the development of solar, wind, geothermal or other sustainable energies. In fact, our reading of the bill indicates that there is no mention of solar, wind or geothermal. This is a rather extraordinary omission, given that wind is the fastest growing source of new energy in the world, and that California, Germany and many other entities are making huge progress in solar energy.
   ""In addition, over the 38 year period, this bill provides over $232 billion for the automobile industry for efforts in ""advanced technology"" and making automobiles more energy efficient. The requirements on the industry for this funding appear extremely weak. The American people might well be asking why an industry that has vigorously and successfully fought an increase in CAFE standards and produces cars in this country which have, from an international perspective, very low mileage per gallon should be rewarded with such a huge bonanza.
   ""In my view, this country can successfully move forward in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and reversing global warming by focusing on energy efficiency and such sustainable energies as wind, solar, geo-thermal and other advancing sustainable technologies.

1746,"THE WEEK IN REVIEW
  On Capitol Hill, senators overwhelmingly passed an energy bill that will improve fuel efficiency in American cars. The Senate also passed a farm bill. Both bills include provisions by Senator Bernie Sanders. Half a world away in Bali, Bush administration delegates to an international conference on global warming sparred over a European Union push to set emission reduction goals. In Vermont, food pantries are confronting shortages at a time of increased need.
   Energy Bill Fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks will be boosted to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The measure that passed the Senate on Thursday includes provisions by Sanders to promote energy efficiency and to train workers for green-collar jobs. ""Given the crisis we're facing in global warming, the passage of this energy bill is an important step forward,"" Sanders said. ""Much more has to be done in the future, but raising fuel efficiency standards and helping states, cities and towns go forward with energy efficiency and sustainable energy projects will reduce carbon emissions, lower energy costs and create good paying jobs.""

   Global Warming Negotiators for President Bush at a United Nations conference on climate change in Bali fought language in a final report that would establish the need for action within the next 15 years and set emission reduction targets for developed countries. In a letter to the president, Sanders and other senators told President Bush ""the world is watching"" and urged him to direct U.S. negotiators to pursue policies ""designed to propel further progress- not fuel additional delay"" The European Union on Saturday reportedly dropped a key demand that guidelines for a new global climate pact should include a reference to tough 2020 emissions goals for rich countries. The final report was expected to refer to a report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that concluded global warming was unequivocal and laid out emissions reductions targets.

   Vermont Granite The Vermont congressional delegation has been assured by the Martin Luther King Foundation that American granite will be used in a monument to the civil rights leader in the nation's capital. Vermont granite suppliers will be eligible to compete for contracts that will be announced in the near future, according to Harry E. Johnson Sr., the president and chief executive officer of the memorial foundation. The assurance that a majority of the granite will be American came in a conversation with Sanders. Senators Patrick Leahy, Sanders and Representative Peter Welch had contacted the foundation to express concern over reports that the project would be built with Chinese granite.

   Food Banks Vermont, like other states around the country, is struggling to fulfill the growing needs of people who are hungry. The Vermont Food Bank has said its supply of food had fallen by 50 percent from last year. Burlington's food shelf has seen a dramatic increase in employed clients in need of help this year. As winter closes in and home heating bills stack up, still more Vermonters are turning to the food support network in Vermont for help. Senator Sanders signed onto legislation that would increase support for food banks. For more, click here.
   Farm Bill The Senate on Friday approved a $286 billion farm bill that would help growers and provide more food stamps for the poor. The bill, passed on a 79 to 14 vote, would extend dairy programs and provide more for renewable energy and conservation programs to protect environmentally sensitive farmland over the next five years. Said Sanders, ""While not perfect, the Senate version of farm bill is an important step forward. The bill is a win for dairy farmers who got an enhanced MILC program. It was also a win for nutrition programs, for bio-energy and for conservation. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Leahy and Congressman Welch to make sure the final bill is as strong we can make it.""

1789,"SEN. SANDERS: TIME TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT PRIVATE CONTRACTING IN THE MILITARY
  Senator Bernie Sanders said today it is time to rethink the privatization of the United States military. 
   In Iraq alone, there are roughly 180,000 private contractors working for American government agencies, including about 30,000 heavily-armed guards.
   The most notorious contractor, Blackwater USA, has been embroiled in controversy over the deaths last month of 17 Iraqis. A State Department contract with the private security firm, which escorts U.S. diplomats traveling outside the heavily protected Green Zone in Baghdad, expires in May. Sanders said the contract should not be renewed.
   Sanders said he would work with other members of the Senate and House in taking a hard look at the role of private contractors in the military. 
   ""The Bush administration has made radical and dangerous changes in the structure of our military, and Congress needs to take a very hard look at that. To my mind, it is wrong and unacceptable for companies like Blackwater to operate in Iraq outside of the chain of command of the United States military and United States government,"" Sanders said.
   ""I also find it troubling when personnel employed by a company like Blackwater are paid far more than soldiers in the U.S. military who are putting their lives on the line every day.""

1841,"SENATE CONTINUES TO WORK ON HIGHER EDUCATION
  The Senate continues to work on higher education. This week, a bill to make it easier to apply for student loans and strengthen support for low-income students is under consideration. The same measure includes a provision by Senator Bernie Sanders to boost enrollment in nursing schools. (more after the jump.) Late last week, the Senate passed a bill to increase grants to low-income students, make more students eligible for the maximum Pell Grants, lower the penalty for students who work and receive financial aid, and forgive the student loan debt for many who make a career in public service. Sanders played a major role in writing the loan forgiveness program for college graduates who stay in public service jobs - including nursing, education, and law enforcement - for a decade.  
   Sanders' nursing provision in the new bill would address a crisis in health care staffing that is getting worse. 
   Baby boomers make up much of today's physician and nursing work force. Looming retirements are expected to thin the ranks significantly in the next few years. By 2020, according to a recent report, the United States could face a shortage of 24,000 doctors and nearly one million nurses. 
   It is not for lack of interest by students that medical and nursing schools aren't turning out enough new graduates. At a time when U.S. hospitals need 118,000 registered nurses to fill vacancies, nursing schools turned away 41,683 qualified applicants from baccalaureate and graduate programs in 2005. Among the reasons: faculty shortages, the lack of adequate clinical facilities, inadequate classroom space, and budget woes. 
   The obvious solution - instead of importing nurses from abroad from places like the Philippines and Africa - is to provide the resources to train more nurses. Health care is a profession that offers both gratification for serving the community and good pay. The median annual earnings of registered nurses was $52,330 in 2004, with salaries for the top tier in the nursing profession paying more than $74,760 a year. 
   Under the bill, colleges would receive $3,000 for each additional nursing student they enroll. Sanders' provision would enable schools to accommodate 10,000 additional students per year. His proposal is supported by Health Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy and by Senator Barbara Mikulski.

1831,"SEN. SANDERS OPPOSES ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said today he will vote against confirmation of Michael B. Mukasey to be attorney general. 
   President Bush's choice to head the Justice Department, Sanders said, holds views on the sweeping powers of the presidency that are at odds with what the framers of our Constitution intended. The nominee also demonstrated at Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings a disregard for civil liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.
   ""Of course the United States government must do everything that it can to protect the American people from the dangerous threat of terrorism,"" Sanders stressed, ""but we can do that effectively consistent with the Constitution and the civil liberties it guarantees.
   ""We need an attorney general who does not believe the president has unlimited power. We need an attorney general who understands that torture is not what this country is about, and we need an attorney general who clearly understands the separation of powers inherent in our Constitution,"" Sanders added. ""Unfortunately, it is clear that Mr. Mukasey is not that person""
   Mukasey, a former federal judge from New York, testified that Congress may be powerless to bar the president from conducting some surveillance without warrants. He incredibly claimed to be unfamiliar with the technique known as waterboarding, and refused to say whether or not it was torture.
   Also troubling was his cramped reading of a Supreme Court ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, the case which struck down military commissions created without congressional approval to try prisoners at Guant?namo Bay. Mukasey doubted the widespread consensus in the legal community that the decision last year extended to those prisoners the protections of a Geneva Convention ban on humiliating and degrading treatment.

1958,"SEN. SANDERS CONTINUES TO CHAMPION VETERANS, NEEDS OF TROOPS IN IRAQ
  Live Earth concerts around the world this weekend along with Sen. Bernie Sanders's town meeting on global warming in Montpelier are shining a spotlight on one of the most important issues that Congress must confront this summer. The war in Iraq, of course, is the other crucial issue at the top of the Senate agenda when Congress reconvenes on Monday.  
   Sanders is the chief sponsor of legislation that would do more than any other bill in the Senate to reverse climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The town meeting in Montpelier puts a Vermont accent on a weekend of worldwide attention to the man-made threat to our planet's environment. His bill would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2050. ""With 10 of the last 12 years being the warmest on record, we are already seeing major problems caused by the warming of the earth,"" Sanders said. ""Global warming is real and it is man-made. Every day that passes that we do not take aggressive action to reverse it is a day that we are punishing our children and grandchildren. The time to act is now,"" Sanders said.
   It also is time - in fact, it's past time - to end the war in Iraq. ""I'm going to do everything I can to bring our troops home as soon as possible,"" Sanders said. 
   In Washington, a crucial development in recent days has been the decision by longtime Bush loyalists to break with the president on the war. Reuters reported on Friday that ""Bush's Iraq war policy continued to hemorrhage support in the U.S. Senate as another senior Republican called on Thursday for a new strategy that would start to bring troops home. A day after Bush appealed to Americans to be more patient with the unpopular war, six-term New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, who is up for re-election next year, urged a new course.""
   Meanwhile, Sanders has continued to champion our veterans and the needs of troops on the ground in Iraq. The Burlington Free Press reported Friday that Sanders responded to concerns of Vermont soldiers in Iraq by writing Acting Army Secretary Preston Geren III about the need for more heavily armored vehicles. ""It is almost incomprehensible to me that, after four years of war and dealing with IEDs, we still do not have enough well-armored vehicles to protect our soldiers,"" Sanders said.

1101,February 14  2007 Waxman  Schumer  and Clinton Unveil Bill to Create Clear Pathway for Generic Biologic Drugs

                       Access to Life Saving Medicine Act  Would Lower Patient Drug Costs for Drugs Used to Treat Diseases Like Cancer  Diabetes  AIDS Washington  DC    Today Rep  Henry A  Waxman  Sen  Charles E  Schumer  and Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton  along with Rep  Jo Ann Emerson and Rep  Frank Pallone  introduced the  Access to Life Saving Medicine Act   which will give Food and Drug Administration  FDA  the express legal authority to approve safe  lower cost copies of biotech drugs  also known as biologics or biopharmaceuticals   Biotech drugs  which are produced from living cell cultures rather than being synthesized chemically  are among the fastest growing and most expensive components of the nation s drug bill   Currently there is no statutory pathway for generic versions of biotech drugs to enter the market  even after all patents have expired   As a result  the manufacturers of biotech drugs can charge monopoly prices  indefinitely   In addition to the members listed above  Senators David Vitter  Debbie Stabenow  Patrick J  Leahy  Susan M  Collins and Representative Rahm Emanuel are original cosponsors of the legislation           We learned 22 years ago that generic drug competition brings consumers affordable  safe  and effective medicines   said Rep  Waxman    The time has come to apply this competition to biotech drugs   This bill will give FDA the clear legal authority to approve safe and effective copies of biotech drugs            Biologics treat some of the most devastating diseases around and no one should be denied access to them because of they re too expensive   said Sen  Schumer    Generic biologics can be a safe and affordable alternative to high priced brand name biologics   Our legislation will allow all Americans to take advantage of these drugs by enabling competition in the market to lower the price and ending permanent monopolies over biologic products   It is high time for these vital treatments to become more affordable and our legislation is just what the doctor ordered             We have witnessed dramatic scientific advances over the past twenty years in the field of biopharmaceuticals but our health care system has not kept pace   Biotech drugs hold great promise  however  we break that promise when costs push treatment out of reach for American families and employers  We should bring safe  effective and affordable generic versions of these medicines to patients  It will save money and save lives   said Senator Clinton          Biotech drugs can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year  imposing financial burdens on patients  employers  insurers  and federal and state governments   The  Access to Life Saving Medicine Act  will authorize FDA to approve abbreviated applications for biological products that are  comparable  to previously approved brand name biological products and it gives the FDA the authority to require any additional clinical information it deems necessary           This bill comes in response to years of recognition of the need for a new statutory pathway for approval of generic versions of biotech drugs   These products are not subject to the 1984 law that first authorized FDA to approve generic drugs   The EMEA  which is Europe s equivalent of the FDA  has had a legal framework in place for approval of  biosimilars  since 2004   In letters received recently  both the AARP and the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market    composed of employers  health plans  generic drug companies  pharmacy benefit managers  and pharmacists    agree that legislation creating a pathway for approval of generic biologics is critically important to assure access to more affordable drugs          Demonstrating that a generic version of a biotech drug is the same as the brand name product raises more complicated scientific issues than for traditional drugs   The bill therefore establishes a rigorous  case by case scientific process for approving these products to make sure they are as safe and as effective as their brand name counterparts   Recent approvals by FDA of similar products  like Omnitrope  a human growth hormone drug approved on the basis of abbreviated tests   show that this approach is scientifically feasible           Generic drugs significantly lower medical costs for Americans and bring many life saving drugs within affordable reach   said Senator Vitter   But biological based drugs   which are among the most expensive on the market   cannot be produced generically under current law   Insulin is a prime example  and with Louisiana having the highest rate of diabetes in the United States  this bill is crucial to ensuring that life saving medicines are reasonably priced             Generic biologics have the potential to save Medicare Part B  14 billion per year  according to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association   said Rep  Jo Ann Emerson   These are often some of the most expensive medications in the marketplace  so the possibility of achieving savings for seniors and taxpayers is very important   As of today  there are no such alternatives to brand name biologics on the market  some of whose patents expired seven to ten years ago   Bringing generic biologics should be a priority for this Congress  with a sharp eye to the future solvency of the Medicare program             Biologic drugs provide effective treatments for some of our most devastating diseases   Unfortunately  however  these drugs are often prohibitively expensive and can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year   It is my hope that by creating a process to bring safe and effective generic versions of biologic drugs to the market  we will increase access and dramatically reduce costs for patients  employers  and federal and state health programs   said Senator Collins           Families in Michigan and across the country are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs  and we need to do everything we can to keep those prices under control   said Senator Stabenow    Lowering the cost of prescription drugs for America s employers is not only good for patients  it is the best way to protect our jobs and stay competitive in a global economy   By opening the market to generic biological drugs this bill will provide real savings to businesses and consumers on some of the most costly medications            Biologic therapies hold the promise of preventing  treating or curing otherwise inevitable  untreatable and incurable diseases   said Senator Leahy   This important legislation will facilitate the approval of safe and effective generic biological products that may serve as less expensive    yet potent    alternatives for consumers            Biologic drugs have the potential to improve the lives of millions of Americans  but their high costs often keep them out of reach for many   said Representative Pallone    I support efforts to increase generic versions of these lifesaving products as long as we strike the right balance between safety and access  which I believe this bill does            The bill has been endorsed by Aetna  the AFL CIO  the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market  Consumer s Union  General Motors  Generic Pharmaceuticals Association  Express Scripts  Inc  and National Organization of Rare Disorders          ,0

1711,"SENATE PASSES LEAHY-SANDERS FORMULA THAT WOULD NET NEARLY $20 MILLION FOR VERMONT TO HELP STEM MORTGAGE CRISIS
  The U.S. Senate has passed legislation authored by Vermont's two U.S. Senators - Patrick Leahy (D) and Bernie Sanders (I) - that would bring nearly $20 million in emergency relief to Vermont's neighborhoods and communities, to quickly redevelop and resell or rent abandoned and foreclosed homes and help stabilize home values, rents and local economies.
   The Senate-passed Foreclosure Prevention Act includes $3.92 billion for communities to use in buying and rehabilitating vacant foreclosed homes, as well as $13 billion in new tax incentives to help spur the sagging housing market. The rehab funds will be allocated through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program. Leahy and Sanders added a formula to distribute the CDBG funds under an all-state minimum that would assure a minimum allocation of .5 percent to each state, ensuring that funds reach small states like Vermont, as well as larger states. The Senate by unanimous consent Wednesday night added the Leahy-Sanders all-state minimum amendment to the housing bill, which then passed the Senate Thursday in a vote of 84 to 12. The bill will go to conference with a counterpart House bill, which is also on a legislative fast track. 
   Leahy and Sanders said Vermont stands to receive at least $19.6 million in CDBG funds under their formula, to help communities prevent foreclosures and redevelop abandoned and foreclosed homes. Rehabilitated homes, purchased at a discount, would be used to stabilize neighborhoods and stem the significant losses in home values.
   Leahy said, ""So far Vermont has not been hurt as badly as other states, but even our rates are rising, and time is not on our side. The sluggish national economy and the rising cost of housing in Vermont is a one-two punch that is pushing affordable housing out of the reach of many Vermont families. The sooner we can step up our efforts to minimize the withering effects of the mortgage crisis on our neighborhoods and communities, the better off we will be and the sooner we all can pull out of this downturn. Our legislation would make sure that Vermont and other small states get the same kind of emergency help that larger states would get.""
   Sanders said, ""While the overall bill was certainly not everything we wanted, this $20 million will help Vermont deal with the foreclosure crisis that is sweeping the country. With this funding, it is my hope that Vermont's cities and towns will be able to provide immediate assistance to the struggling middle class trying to hold onto their homes and improve communities hit hard by foreclosures. Clearly, we must do everything we can to prevent the American dream of homeownership from turning into the American nightmare of foreclosure that too many American families are experiencing.""
   Though the mortgage crisis is worse in other regions of the country, foreclosure rates also continue to rise in Vermont, particularly in the Northeast Kingdom and Southeastern Vermont. According to Vermont's Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration, for the first quarter of 2008, more than 400 new foreclosures have been filed in Vermont, a 30 percent increase over those filed for the same quarter last year. If that pattern holds, Vermont this year could be facing about 1600 foreclosures. Subprime mortgage-related foreclosures will cost Vermont $74.5 million over the second half of 2007 through the end of 2009, according to Congress's Joint Economic Committee, which also says the losses nationwide will reach nearly $104 billion.

                     Washington  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  13 4 million in the FY06 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for defense projects to benefit Central New York  including  2 6 million for Rome Labs for their Cyber Situational Awareness and Enable Network Centric Warfare projects   5 million for Syracuse Research  s Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Enhancement system   1 million for Cortland Cable  s Synthetic Material Arresting Gear Cable   1 8 million for Sensis Corporation  s Ground Air Task Oriented Radar  G ATOR   and  3 million for Lockheed Martin Syracuse  s TPS 59 HELRASR Support for US Ballistic Missile Defense Systems   The House has approved the bill and it must now get Senate approval before being sent to the President and signed into law             This is great news for Central New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Central New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Central New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge          Central New York has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support     5 million of the federal funding will go to the Syracuse Research Corporation for the development of Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Enhancement  LCMR   The funding will create new opportunities to improve and enhance national security  The radar  developed for the Special Operations Command  SOCOM  and currently in theater  provides the capability to automatically locate mortar firing positions by detecting and tracking the mortar shell  then backtracking to the weapon position  Accordingly  this technology will allow soldiers in combat to more effectively take cover from mortar fire  locate its origin  and respond  LCMR systems have already been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  Funding in this legislation would upgrade these systems  SRC received  2 5 million of federal funding for the LCMR in FY 05          2 5 million of the federal funding will go to Rome Air Force Research Laboratory   1 million will go to AFRL  s Cyber Situational Awareness technology project and  1 6 million to the Enable Network Centric Warfare project  The funding for the Cyber Situational Awareness will be used in developing Cyber Course of Action Tools  which deal with determining appropriate fine grain  automated defensive responses to adversary information warfare attacks and developing sensor fusion  which is concerned with fusing the information collected by sensors in order to create a consistent  comprehensive picture of what is occurring at all levels of a military operation        Federal funding for Enable Network Centric Warfare would support efforts to develop  integrate  and demonstrate enhanced airborne networking capabilities in support of Network Centric operations  Funding will be used to accelerate the evolution of airborne networking technologies  providing both an immediate improvement to current warfighting capabilities  as well as forming the basis for enabling future airborne network centric capabilities    1 million in federal funding will also go to Cortland Cable for the development of Synthetic Material Arresting Cable  and is anticipated to have a positive employment impact  The funding supported under this request will continue previously funded efforts to investigate the use of lightweight  synthetic materials and novel cable construction to replace the steel cables that recover aircraft aboard U S  Navy Aircraft Carriers  Synthetic cables could improve the factor of safety of the entire system by 60   Because the strength to weight of synthetic materials is 4 5 times better than steel  system inertia is significantly reduced  enabling the arresting gear to apply breaking force much earlier  The use of synthetic cable also possesses a potential weight savings of 62 tons per carrier and increase arresting gear performance by 25   Cortland Cable received  1 million in FY 05         1 8 million in federal funding will go to Sensis Corporation Ground Air Task Oriented Radar  G ATOR  Engineering Development Model   The G ATOR program is a single material solution for the Multi Role Radar System  MRRS  and Ground Weapons Locator Radar  GWLR  requirements  G ATOR replaces and consolidates the capability of numerous legacy radars  including the AN TPS 63 air surveillance  AN MPQ 62 force control  AN TPS 73 air traffic control and AN UPS 3 air defense radar systems   Funding under this request will be used in the development of the G ATOR prototype   Current radar performance does not meet operational forces requirements  Failure to support this initiative delays seizing the moment in taking advantage of technological breakthroughs  The lapse jeopardizes operational forces from having the technological advantage in detecting  identifying  and classifying threats on the battlefield  The consequences could potentially allow opposing forces to gain air and ground superiority in future operational areas            3 million in federal funding will go to Lockheed Martin MS2 Radar Systems for TPS 59 HELRASR Support for US Ballistic Missile Defense System   This funding will be used for systems engineering analysis  modifications  and test and evaluation of the TPS 59 against long range ballistic missiles including any opportunities to integrate the TPS 59 into MDA Integrated Flight Tests in 2006  The US Marine Corps TPS 59 is a 360 degree  tactically mobile  L band air and missile defense radar   The TPS 59 was upgraded by MDA  then BMDO  in the 1990  s to detect and track ballistic missiles and provide cues to missile defense weapon systems such as Patriot and AEGIS   The TPS 59 has successfully demonstrated it capabilities against various short range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles  including successful intercepts of these targets  The USMC is defining an upgrade of the TPS 59 antenna to reduce weight and increase mobility of the system under the HELRASR program   The HELRASR program currently has three years of design and development  driven largely by the funding profile   This effort would help bridge the requirements gap between the MDA and the USMC  greatly leveraging the production line startup of the TPS 59 and the engineering and development of HELRASR            ,0
1381,January 17  2007 Senators Bayh and Clinton  Congressman McHugh Discuss Their Visit with US Troops in Iraq   Afghanistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Read Senator Clinton s trip report from Iraq and Afghanistan   Washington  DC   Senators Evan Bayh  D IN  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   and Congressman John M  McHugh  R NY   held a press conference to discuss their Congressional Delegation  CODEL  visit to U S  Forces serving in the Central Command Area of Responsibility  including Iraq and Afghanistan  Below is the text of Senator Clinton s remarks             Thank you very much  As some of you know  I sit next to Senator Bayh on the Armed Services Committee and Congressman McHugh and I have the great honor of representing the 10th Mountain Division  which is based at Fort Drum in Upstate New York  It  s the most deployed division in the United States Army           We went into Lahore for the purpose of meeting with President Musharraf  a meeting that lasted approximately 90 minutes  During that extensive  broad discussion  President Musharraf described some of his frustrations with his relationships with the Afghan government  We  ve heard about some of the difficulties on both sides of the border in preventing the resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda forces from going back and forth  And when we were in Afghanistan our military commanders described to us the challenges that they have faced with the increased penetration coming from the Pakistani side of the border           Obviously  from President Musharraf  s perspective  he has some legitimate questions about how best to work with his Afghan counterparts that he shared with us  He raised his concerns about the state of relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan  And I am concerned that when we most need troops on the ground in Afghanistan and a very tight relationship that is focused on good intelligence and military intervention to prevent the resurgence of the Taliban and Al Qaeda  we might have some difficulties between our two great allies          I discussed with both President Karzai and President Musharraf whether a high level United States envoy on a continuing basis would be helpful and they both expressed a positive reaction  As some of you might remember  President Bush had both Presidents to dinner together to try to work out some of their concerns  And upon returning to the United States  I placed a call to the White House and spoke with the National Security Advisor  Steve Hadley  to urge that the President consider appointing such a high level Presidential envoy           From Pakistan  we flew to Ramstein Air Force Base where we spent another very short night  And the next morning traveled to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center  where seriously wounded service members from Iraq and Afghanistan are brought for treatment  We were very impressed with the high quality of services available to our men and women in uniform and I met New Yorkers there  Senator Bayh met soldiers and marines from Indiana  But I could certainly assure everyone who has a loved one in these theaters of combat that they have the very best care available  In fact  I met one soldier who had suffered an injury in Fallujah and he is from New York City  so I called his mother to tell his mother that he was doing very well  And I could say that because he certainly was           I also heard from some of the soldiers   their concerns about the circumstances they find themselves in   in Iraq  One told us  as he was lying in his bed with his injuries  that in encountering one of these shape charges  these new more advanced  more sophisticated command controlled IEDs  that the armored  fully equipped Humvee had saved his life and the life of his buddies  We talked later about how we still don  t have that vehicle  fully packed  available to everybody  something that we still have not accomplished    We met with our U S  Commanders as well and toured the Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility  which is the first stop for our brave wounded heroes when they come back for medical care before being taken home          During these intense four days  we had the opportunity to talk with U S  military serving in the theaters  with our U S  civilian representatives and certainly with foreign leaders  My experiences underscored my concerns based on both what I saw and what I did not see  We saw American service men and women performing bravely and magnificently and we also saw a strategy that is not working  I personally did not see the kind of tangible evidence of actions that we should be expecting from the Iraqi government  And I believe our priorities are upside down  Afghanistan is a success story thus far  and yet we know it  s going to be under increasing pressure in the months ahead  We should be adding more American military forces and we should be requiring the NATO countries to fulfill their commitments to the forces that they had promised us           In Iraq  the prescription is the opposite  Rather than an escalation of U S  troops  which I do not believe will contribute to long term success in Iraq  we should be beginning a phased redeployment of U S  troops as a way to put pressure on the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security and future           The President is sending mixed signals  He has finally said that this is not an open ended commitment in Iraq  but he is providing the Iraqis with an open ended presence of American troops  We need to change course           It would be a great irony if the Administration  s emphasis on escalating our presence in Iraq caused it to ignore the threat facing Afghanistan where those responsible for planning the September 11 attacks are still our enemies  The President  s team is pursuing a failed strategy in Iraq as it edges closer to collapse and Afghanistan needs more of our concerted effort and attention           I support making several changes  Secretary  Senator  Bayh and I sent a letter today to Secretary of Defense Gates reflecting what we heard from our military commanders  they asked for additional troops  Now  if they are asking us  I assume they are asking others as well  They were asking for two additional infantry battalions in the south and that if  as is planned  there is a rotation out of a battalion in the east and that it will eventually be re deployed to Iraq  that that battalion be replaced or not moved           I plan to introduce legislation with regard to Iraq that includes three components  First  it will cap the number of troops in Iraq at the levels they existed on January 1st and will require the Administration to seek Congressional authorization for any additional troops  This type of troop limit has ample historical precedent including a cap on the number of U S  troops in Lebanon in 1983 and more recently  Congress has limited the number of U S  troops in Columbia  Second  as a means to increase our leverage with the Iraqi government  my legislation would also impose conditions for continued funding of the Iraqi security forces and the private contractors working for the Iraqis  It would require certification that the security forces were free of sectarian and militia influence and were assuming greater responsibility for Iraqi security           I do not support cutting funding for American troops  but I do support cutting funding for Iraqi forces if the Iraqi government does not meet set conditions  Finally  my legislation will require the Administration to meet additional conditions for success in Iraq  including the assumption of greater responsibilities by the Iraqi government within six months           The Administration has claimed that it intends to hold the Iraqi government to certain conditions and this legislation will ensure that both the Bush Administration and the Iraqi government meet their commitments  The conditions would require the Administration to certify that Iraq has disarmed the militias  ensure equitable sharing of oil revenues  make the constitutional changes to ensure rights for each ethnic community  reverse de Baathification to allow teachers  professionals and others who joined the Baath party as a means to get a job to serve in the new Iraqi government  It would require the Administration to engage in a regional diplomatic initiative  including all of Iraq  s neighbors to address Iraq  s future and begin the phased redeployment of U S  troops  If these conditions are not met  or not on the way to being met within six months  the Congressional authorization requirement would be triggered           We all know that this is a very difficult dilemma that is confronting our country  There are many concerns on both sides of the aisle  Before we came in here  some of you heard my colleagues  Senator Biden  Senator Hagel  who have been working with Senator Levin  Senator Reid and others to present a bipartisan resolution of disapproval of the President  s policy  I certainly will support that  But from what I have heard out of the Administration thus far  I think we will eventually have to move to tougher requirements on the Administration to get their attention           This is a grave matter  America  s vital national security interests are involved and certainly the lives and the health of our young men and women in uniform is at stake and the Iraqi people  s future is as well  So  I hope that we can start having a discussion in the Congress among ourselves and with the Administration that will lead to a change of course and not adding more troops  pursuing a strategy that under present circumstances cannot be successful        Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq         ,0
1682,March 1  2007 Senator Clinton Questions Administration and Military Officials About U S  Policy in Afghanistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Clinton  I really appreciate Senator Webb s line of questioning because it really illustrates the continuing difficulty we have in sorting out what it is that s happening on the ground  What I am concerned about is whether we are losing time to be able to get that figured out  I think we are really at a tipping point in Afghanistan  I felt that when I was there last month  And I hope that the Administration s commitment to new troops  the effort to get NATO more focused  the hope that we can strengthen the Karzai government  all has to happen simultaneously in order to take on these challenges  Whether it be a new offensive this spring or the growing strength of the drug lords            I wanted to switch gears for a minute though because there are many things that have been spoken about that are very clearly difficult for America to influence  But I want to talk about force protection for our forces and their quality of life because we are putting more in  number one  and number two  I think we all believe the violence will increase  Whether we will see an explosion of violence that brings other elements of the Afghan society into it  as we saw after the bombing of the mosque in Samara  I don t know  But clearly  with the up tick in suicide bombers and some of the other activities that we are seeing there is going to be a big push to escalate the violence           Earlier this month the 82nd Airborne Division assumed responsibility for the combat mission from the 10th Mountain Division  which is based at Fort Drum in upstate New York  As subordinate units from the 82nd moved into position  10th Mountain Division 3rd Brigade combat teams were displaced to Jalalabad  And what we re getting in reports back to Fort Drum  in fact a February 26 Fort Drum news release highlights the issue I want to discuss with you  There is a Sergeant First Class who is quoted by saying the amount of people on the FOB and the amount of billeting didn t coincide  In other words  soldiers were living in a variety of very difficult and challenging living conditions           My concern is that with a build up in offensive capability coming from Pakistan and other areas within Afghanistan  whether we re also leaving our troops more exposed than they need to be  particularly in these forward operating bases  it is disconcerting to extend a brigade by four months  which is what we did with the 10th Mountain Division and make further demands  if we don t have some adequate planning and execution for their logistical needs  We are getting reports that we don t have enough bunkers  force protection barriers  check point security systems  artillery radar systems  UAVs and other critical equipment for expanding the mission as I think the majority  certainly speaking for myself  agree we must do  The deficiencies in the GAO report highlighted equipment shortages in the CENTCOM areas of operations  I have referred to that earlier in hearings focused on Iraq because that was a constant source of complaint on my recent trip and in my discussions with a lot of the soldiers and Marines who have returned from their deployments           So I think that it would be incumbent upon you General and others to make sure we don t have shortages in resources as we are adding more American troops  And that we have the services and logistics for the arriving troops  And again  I see this as an issue of force protections primarily          What I wanted to ask about is an article in today s New York Times that NATO and American forces knew there was a suicide bomber in the Bagram area before the suicide bomb attack that killed 23 at the main gate  Probably all of us have been at Bagram and we know the security checkpoints one goes through  We know  obviously that the Vice President was there and that the timing of the suicide attack  some have said  at least contributed to the sell off in the stock market  Whether it did that or not  it was a serious and concerning incident   Apparently  according to this article  the Afghan police chief in the area said he had not been informed of the possible threat  I would like to ask the General first and then the Ambassador  Is there a reason why the Afghan police forces would not have been notified  And what mechanisms exist for coordinating with Afghan forces when intelligence threats are received  How would you analyze what happened or what went wrong here       General Lute   Well Senator  I m aware of the same reports today that you refer to   It is not usual that specific threats would not be coordinated with all elements that could address them  to include the Afghan police   I do know that there are force protection mechanisms in place around Bagram and every place else that we have Americans stationed that feature close coordination with local officials   So this caught me a bit short as well and I really can t explain it today until I have some time to look into it  The other point though I d make  is that  without crossing into the classified realm  is that with a suicide bomber roughly every third day last year in Afghanistan  so over 100 suicide bombers last year  most of them acted without any specific indications in terms of time and place   So  while there may well have been a report  it was probably not specific in terms of time and location   And of course that doesn t lead us far in terms of what we might do by way of prevention         Senator Clinton   I think it would be useful General  to perhaps submit some additional information to the committee after you have conducted further inquiry       General Lute   Fair enough  Will do so       Senator Clinton  Ambassador  do you have anything to add        Ambassador Edelman  No  I really don t  Senator Clinton  I saw the same story in the Times today  but like General Lute  I didn t have any awareness that there had been a specific intelligence report  So we ll check into it and get back to you        Senator Clinton   Let me also ask that with the changes in command that have occurred recently with General McNeil  the overall Senior NATO Commander  with our Ambassador in Afghanistan  scheduled to leave  with our Ambassador in Pakistan leaving  I think we re really going to regret the disruption of all these relationships  I ve suggested to the White House that they at least try to get some permanent presence with a high level Presidential envoy to move back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan   There s so much disagreement and misunderstanding  as well as different perspectives about what should be in the interest of both of these leaders and their countries   But I m just worried that what we re seeing as an unraveling situation that will accelerate because there is no  there s nobody there who has any on going relationship base            And I m also concerned about the command changes and adjustments about lines of authority in Afghanistan  and again General  maybe you could get back to us on this   Who authorizes targets to be bombed   Who gets priority for Medivac assets  Who gets priority for artillery support or receives logistics and what priority  What rules of engagement are now actually in effect   We ve had these problems with NATO countries sending in troops but having different rules of engagement   Where does that stand now and who sorts out all of the potential disagreements among the various troops        General Lute   Senator  the 32 000 troops  to include 15 000 Americans that are part of the NATO structure  so ISAF   are under one set of rules of engagement  They re approved by the North Atlantic Council  General Jones is the resident expert in this room in terms of the specifics  but all those troops operate under the same rules  What distinguishes some national contributions inside that structure from others is that some are assigned missions that don t take them into the combat realm  So there are some forces inside that 32 000 NATO force structure that conduct PRT  Prevention Reconstruction Team missions  and not combat operations  But they  none the less  operate under the same ROE   As for all your  the list of different forms of support  casualty evacuation  close air support  logistic and so forth  those are all today coordinated by four star NATO Commander  who happens today to be a U S  Commander  General Dan McNeil out of Kabul         Senator Clinton    Just one final follow up   Are they the same rules of engagement that we had in Iraq prior to this latest escalation       General Lute    They re not precisely the same  but they re very close       Senator Clinton    There were many complaints about the rules of engagement  at least for our forces in Iraq and they ve been changed because of the escalation   But I d like to know what the differences are       General Lute    The key difference in Baghdad I think   is the place in particular that you are citing  was that before this recent change in azimuth  in Iraq  there were political constraints on locations inside Baghdad and some political party affiliations inside Baghdad  which prohibited  or at least inhibited our operations against them   Those have been removed and we don t suffer that same problem in Afghanistan       Senator Clinton    Thank you       Ambassador Edelman   Senator Clinton  if I might also address some of the understandable concerns I think you raised about continuity with some of the changes  I think there are some mitigating factors  One is that General McNeil  of course  is going back for a second tour in Afghanistan  So although he is new to his current job and responsibilities  he does have a familiarity with the key players like President Karzai and others  And I think General Freakley is there for some period of time in a U S  duel hatted Deputy  So there are some  I think

1843,"SEN. SANDERS SAYS NO WAR FUNDS WITHOUT IRAQ WITHDRAWAL TIMELINE
  Congressional leaders planned to vote by this weekend on a war spending measure that does not set a date for withdrawing American combat troops from Iraq. Sen. Sanders intends to vote against the legislation if it does not contain a timeline to end the war. He thinks the war has been a disaster. Of the more than 760 respondents who had taken a Sanders' web site survey, 92 percent of Americans and 94 percent of Vermonters said Congress should insist on a timeline for withdrawal of American troops from Iraq. 
   The Senate voted May 16 on legislation cosponsored by Senators Sanders and Leahy that called for bringing our troops home within four months and pulling virtually everyone out of Iraq by the end of next March. ""The war in Iraq, which President Bush misled us into, has been a disaster and more and more Americans understand that,"" Sanders said at the time. ""The amendment I voted for would allow for a responsible, phased redeployment that will remove our service members from the crossfire of an escalating civil war in Iraq. It would also send a clear message to the Iraqi people and their government that they must begin to work through the difficult issues that will be necessary to create a stable and lasting peace. Importantly, it will also allow us to better focus our energies on combating the very serious problems of international terrorism.""
   On May 1, the day President Bush vetoed supplemental spending legislation that include a schedule for withdrawal, Sanders said in an interview on Vermont Public Radio program Switchboard that he would not support a new spending bill unless it includes specific provisions to bring U.S. troops home. ""My view is that the Congress has got to be as strong as it possibly can be, to say that we've got to bring our troops home as soon as possible. We cannot continue to fund endlessly month after month, year after year a war which is costing us so much in lives in money and lack of respect around the world.""

667,   Obama Statement on Efforts to Assist Former Blockson Chemical Plant Workers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Statement on Efforts to Assist Former Blockson Chemical Plant Workers Tuesday  April  8  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT   Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following update on his efforts to ensure that the workers from the former Blockson Chemical plant in Braidwood  Illinois are informed about claims they have filed with the U S  Department of Labor under the federal Energy Employees Occupational Illness and Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA   The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  ABRWH   which by law reports to the Secretary of Health and Human Services  and is appointed by the President  is holding a meeting April 7 9 in Tampa  Florida   While the Advisory Board will discuss issues related to several former nuclear weapons sites around the country  one of the items on their agenda is the Blockson Chemical Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  petition     After these Blockson Chemical plant workers and their families have already suffered through so much  we owe it them make sure the government takes a second look at all of the claims that were denied   said Senator Obama    I call on the Advisory Board to approve the petition  and ensure that everyone is compensated   But  if the petition is not granted  I am pleased to know these denied claims will at least be reopened and recalculated    I am committed to these Illinoisans  claims  and will do everything I can to keep their chances of compensation alive    The EEOICPA  which was enacted in 2000  is designed to provide compensation to the hundreds of thousands of Americans who worked on the U S  government s nuclear weapons development program during the Cold War   Many of these workers were often exposed to harmful radiation  without their knowledge  and now suffer from cancer and other debilitating illnesses   The U S  Department of Labor administers the EEOICPA program  while the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH   a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  administers the dose reconstruction aspect of the program   The EEOICPA law provides two ways for workers or their survivors to be compensated  individually or as part of a larger group   For individuals  through a process called  dose reconstruction   NIOSH estimates the exposure workers were subjected to using mathematical models based on available data  such as contracts  purchase orders  safety monitoring records and worker medical records   However  if workers believe the government cannot accurately perform the dose reconstructions  a petitioner can file a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  petition on behalf of a group of workers   This petition is filed with NIOSH   Once NIOSH completes an evaluation of a petition  NIOSH presents its report to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  ABRWH    If the Advisory Board  which currently has twelve members  determines that the government cannot accurately complete dose reconstructions  then by majority vote the Board will send a report with its recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services   If the Advisory Board sides with the government s argument that dose reconstructions can be performed with sufficient accuracy  the Board will vote to recommend denial of the SEC petition   On its own initiative  NIOSH can advise  and in the past has advised  the Advisory Board that it could not perform dose reconstructions and thus has recommended that a class of claimants be compensated via an SEC   The Secretary of Health and Human Services makes the ultimate determination as to whether a petition should be approved or denied  In the case of Blockson Chemical  an SEC petition has been submitted   The Advisory Board met in 2006 in Naperville  IL  where Senator Obama addressed the Board and advocated on behalf of workers at several Illinois nuclear weapons sites  including Blockson Chemical   At that time  Senator Obama pressed the government to hold worker outreach meetings with Blockson workers to hear first hand accounts of what transpired at Blockson  to seek the counsel of an outside auditor as to the accuracy of the dose reconstructions being performed on Blockson claims  and to delay voting by the Advisory Board until the Board s independent auditor could perform a full review    NIOSH has contended that there is sufficient information to conduct a dose reconstruction by calculating the radiation that the Blockson employees were exposed to based on radiation that workers at an unrelated factory were exposed to and on urinalysis data from some  but not all  Blockson workers   I confess I m not a radiation expert   There are some around this table who are   But it does strike me that this is a somewhat suspect way at arriving at whether Blockson workers were sufficiently exposed to deserve compensation   It also seems to me to be contrary to the intent of the original legislation governing this compensation program  and I d strongly urge the Board to review this policy   I m also concerned that no official worker outreach meeting was conducted with the Blockson workers   Seems to me that if you re going to do a dose reconstruction  you d want to talk to all the workers  find out what evidence they have  and give them all a chance to comment on the procedure you re going to follow   So as a consequence I would urge the Board to postpone its decision regarding the Blockson SEC petition until after the Board s independent auditor has had a chance to review NIOSH s arguments    Comments delivered by Senator Obama to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  December 12  2006  Naperville  IL  All of Senator Obama s requests were agreed to by the Board and NIOSH  At present  the Blockson claimant who filed the SEC petition has defined the SEC class as  All Atomic Weapons Employers employees  contractors and subcontractors  who worked in Building 55 at the Blockson Chemical Company  also known as Olin Mathieson  from January 1  1951 to December 31  1962    However  after discussions between NIOSH and the Department of Labor  the following class definition was offered and used by NIOSH in its evaluation   All Atomic Weapons Employers personnel who worked on activities related to the production of uranium at Blockson Chemical Company  Joliet  IL from January 1  1951 to December 31  1962   In terms of compensation  whether it is through the individual dose reconstruction process or via an SEC petition  workers who are approved for payment receive  150 000 plus medical benefits   It is important to stress that the Secretary of Health and Human Services decides who will  or will not  be in any class which receives compensation  although the Advisory Board s recommendation is an important part of his decision   With respect to the SEC petition  the Advisory Board has several options   It can   1  approve the petition according to the petitioner s definition  2  approve the petition according to the governments proposed definition  3  approve the petition with a new definition  drafted by the Board  4  deny the petition in its entirety  or 5  delay voting on the petition to a subsequent meeting   Following next week s meeting in Tampa  the next Advisory Board meeting will be held in June in St  Louis   The date and location are undetermined   To date  based on radiation dose reconstructions completed by NIOSH  the Department of Labor has approved 20 Blockson claims for payment and 91 claims have been denied  However  at Senator Obama s request  in late 2006 the Advisory Board sought and received a review by the Advisory Board s independent auditor  Sanford Cohen   Associates  as to the technical approach used by NIOSH to calculate Blockson dose reconstructions   After a thorough review  Sanford Cohen   Associates recommended seven changes to the dose reconstruction process   As a result  if the Advisory Board does not approve the Blockson SEC  NIOSH will automatically re calculate the 91 dose reconstructions previously denied in order to include these new recommendations   Any claimant who has already received compensation would not have his or her dose reconstruction re calculated and the compensation decision would stand   Senator Obama s staffer  who handles nuclear weapons worker compensation issues  will be in Tampa  Florida to monitor the Board s deliberations and speak on the workers  behalf

1777,"NEW U.N REPORT STRESSES NEED FOR STRONG ACTION NOW ON GLOBAL WARMING
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said today that a new United Nations report makes the case, more forcefully then ever before, that reductions in greenhouse gases are needed to avert a global climate catastrophe. 
   ""The scientists are now telling us the situation is worse than they previously thought. It is incumbent upon Congress to pass bold and aggressive legislation or the planet is going to suffer severe and irreversible harm,"" Sanders said of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the prestigious scientific panel that last month shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former vice president Al Gore.
   Sanders is the chief sponsor of the most far-reaching bill in Congress on global warming. He has worked to craft legislation that breaks a dependence on fossil fuels and invests in clean energy sources such as wind, solar and geothermal. ""The good news is that the technology is available. What's lacking is the political will,"" said Sanders, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.

678,   Obama Bill Would Make Election Fraud and Voter Intimidation Publishable by Law   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Bill Would Make Election Fraud and Voter Intimidation Publishable by Law Wednesday  March  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  202  228 5511 U S  Senator Barack Obama testified today before the House Judiciary Committee on deceptive practices in elections  Obama sponsored the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act  which would make election fraud and voter intimidation punishable by law  and the Voter Advocate and Democracy Index Act  which would require states to report on their election performance  His testimony is below   I was pleased to introduce the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act in the Senate  along with my colleague Senator Charles Schumer  and others such as Senator Kennedy and Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Patrick Leahy  and I am honored that my colleagues in the House  including Chairman Conyers  Congressman Emanuel  Congressmen Becerra  Honda  and Ellison  introduced companion legislation last week   It   s hard to imagine that we even need a bill like this   But  unfortunately  there are people who will stop at nothing to try to deceive voters and keep them away from the polls   What   s worse  these practices often target and exploit vulnerable populations  such as minorities  the disabled  or the poor   We saw countless examples in this past election   Some of us remember the thousands of Latino voters in Orange County  California  who received letters warning them in Spanish that     if you are an immigrant  voting in a federal election is a crime that can result in incarceration       Or the voters in Maryland who received a    democratic sample ballot    featuring a Republican candidate for Governor and a Republican candidate for U S  Senator   Or the voters in Virginia who received calls from a so called    Virginia Elections Commission    informing them     falsely     that they were ineligible to vote   Or the voters who were told that they couldn   t vote if they had family members who had been convicted of a crime    Of course  these so called warnings have no basis in fact  and are made with only one goal in mind     to keep Americans away from the polls   We see these problems year after year and election and after election  and my hope is that this bill will finally stop these practices in time for the next election   The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act makes voter intimidation and deception punishable by law  and it contains strong penalties so that people who commit these crimes suffer more than just a slap on the wrist   The bill also seeks to address the real harm of these crimes    people who are prevented from voting by misinformation     by establishing a process for reaching out to these misinformed voters with accurate information so they can cast their votes in time   There are some issues in this country that are inherently difficult and political   Making sure that every American can cast a ballot shouldn   t be one of them   There is no place for politics in this debate     no room for those who feel that they can gain a partisan advantage by keeping people away from the polls   As the New York Times stated in its January 31st editorial on this issue     the bill     is an important step toward making elections more honest and fair  There is no reason it should not be passed by Congress unanimously      I ask that this editorial be placed into the record   It   s time to get this done in a bipartisan fashion  and I believe this bill can make it happen   I look forward to working with you  Chairman Conyers  and the other members of the Committee  as well as the many co sponsors of this bill  to pass this legislation this Congress                                   ,1
1788,"SEN. SANDERS: SCIENCE MUST GUIDE GLOBAL WARMING LEGISLATION
  Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Environment and Public Works subcommittee chaired by Senator Joseph Lieberman, said today he would work to strengthen legislation on global warming proposed by Lieberman and Senator John Warner. 
   ""I look forward to playing an active role in strengthening the legislation they introduced today. The issue we're dealing with here is not Democrat versus Republican, Progressive versus Conservative. What we're dealing with are the laws of physics, and it's absolutely imperative that we produce legislation which the scientists tell us that we need, legislation strong and effective enough to reverse global warming and prevent catastrophic damage to our planet.""
   The most recent studies, Sanders added, have found that scientists had underestimated the rapidity of changes caused by global warming. 
   ""The problem is even worse than many have previously suggested,"" Sanders said. ""If anything, the legislation Senator Boxer and I introduced in January, the strongest legislation introduced in Congress to address global warming, is probably too conservative to address the problem. It is likely that we should be even more aggressive in our targets and timetables for mandatory reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.""
   In a Senate floor statement, Sanders cited the views of major environmental groups on the Lieberman-Warner legislation. US Public Interest Research Group said, ""This new bill must be strengthened."" The Sierra Club called the legislation ""a significant political step forward for the U.S. Congress, but unfortunately?still falls short what is demanded by the science and the public to meet the challenge of global warming."" Physicians for Social Responsibility also weighed in, calling on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee ""to make necessary improvements before passing the bill.""
   Sanders also told colleagues that if we have the courage to be bold, and move away from fossil fuels toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy, that we could create millions of good paying jobs in the process. There are enormous job creation opportunities in expanding solar, wind, geo-thermal, bio-fuel and energy efficiency technologies.""

                  WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Clinton joined several of her colleagues on the Helsinki Commission  calling on Prime Minister Ference Gyurcsany of Hungary to ensure that the Hungarian Government cooperates with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum   The Museum has experienced trouble accessing several major categories of archival records and extensive collections  held by the Hungarian Government          The work of the United States Holocaust Museum is a critical part of our ongoing process of remembrance     Senator Clinton said    I know that the Prime Minister of Hungary recognizes the importance of these efforts  I hope he will take the necessary steps to open these files           The letter was sent to Prime Minister Gyurcsany following reports that U S  Holocaust Museum has experienced trouble accessing several major categories of Hungarian State Archives and Budapest Municipal Archives   These collections  which address some of the most important topics relating to the Holocaust in Hungary such as military records  deportation records and property expropriation records  continue to be inaccessible to the Museum despite numerous promises from the Hungarian Government        The Helsinki Commission is an independent U S  Government agency created in 1976 to monitor and encourage compliance throughout Europe with the Helsinki Final Act and contribute to the formulation of U S  policy           A copy of the Helsinki Commission  s letter is attached        April 5  2005   E  Ferenc Gyurcsany  Prime Minister of Hungary   Budapest  Hungary        Dear Mr  Prime Minister         We write regarding the difficulties which we understand the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has encountered in its archival work in Hungary  We respectfully urge your government to cooperate fully with the vital work of the Museum in advancing Holocaust education and research  including by granting timely access for their researchers to all Holocaust related archival materials in Hungary         While the Museum  s access to the Hungarian State Archives and the Budapest Municipal Archives has been satisfactory  there are several major categories of archival records and extensive collections  held by the Hungarian Government  which continue to be inaccessible to the Museum despite numerous promises otherwise  These archival collections address some of the most important topics relating to the Holocaust in Hungary and include  military records related to the forced labor of Jews  records related to the deportation of Jews  including the deportation records from 1944  records of the Hungarian gendarmerie  records of the investigation of the Kamenets Podolsk massacre  property expropriation records  and various categories of records that during the communist era would have been in the custody of the country  s intelligence agencies  Access has also been blocked to the records of the war time and post World War II Jewish organizations which were active in Hungary   records that may also have been held by the country  s intelligence services         Representatives of the Holocaust Museum have been told that the collections vanished in war time bombardments or during the 1956 revolution  While it is conceivable that some document may have been destroyed  it seems highly unlikely and dubious that the entire records of the most sensitive part of the history of the Holocaust in Hungary would have vanished         Due to their access to records of the Ministries of Interior in other ex communist countries the Museum has had a wealth of information on the Holocaust at their disposal  Regrettably  in Hungary  the Historical Archives of the State Security Agencies  ABTL   which include a portion of the records of the former communist Ministry of Internal Affairs  has granted the Museum access to only 365 files over a three year period  and have not even shared with the Museum  s researchers reliable information regarding the full extent of ABTL archival holdings         Mr  Prime Minister  we commend you for your recent remarks during the Commemoration of the Victims of Communism when you said   The new Hungary will be able to be born  when she has a chance to look into the eyes of the old Hungary       The generations of Hungarians who live today are not responsible for the crimes

1204,March 15  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Initiative to Address Growing Crisis Facing Subprime Mortgage Holders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   In an address to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced an initiative to address the growing crisis facing those holding subprime mortgages   Underscoring the need to make the rules clear and level the playing field for homebuyers  Senator Clinton outlined a plan to break down barriers to owning a home and build up protections against unfair and unscrupulous lending practices   Senator Clinton s plan will provide more borrowing options for lower income  minority and first time homebuyers before they sign on the dotted line  more information and safeguards against abuses when signing a mortgage  and smart reforms to reduce foreclosures              In her remarks  Senator Clinton emphasized the urgent need to act    The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street   It is a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families buying a home  many of them for the first time  We need to expand the role of the Federal Housing Administration to issue more mortgages at better rates to these homeowners  And we need to give consumers more counseling and information  prevent families from being trapped in high interest loans with pre payment penalties  and in some cases allow more breathing room from foreclosure  This market is clearly broken  and if we don t fix it  it could threaten our entire housing market   said Senator Clinton            The market for subprime loans has expanded rapidly  growing from  20 billion in 1993 to over  600 billion today    Subprime now represents 23 percent of all new mortgage loans and 13 percent of all mortgages outstanding   The subprime mortgage market serves mostly people with poor or limited credit histories  and the rates and fees on subprime mortgages are higher than those on traditional mortgages   According to Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   subprime borrowers are disproportionately African American and Latino            With the real estate market cooling  subprime borrowers are facing significant challenges   The situation is made worse by the fact that the two year  fixed rate  teaser  period on over  300 billion in adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs  will expire this year  saddling most borrowers with higher monthly payments   The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that nearly 20 percent of subprime loans made in 2005 and 2006 will end in foreclosure   Late payments and defaults are rising rapidly  In the fourth quarter of 2006  13 3 percent of all sub prime loans and 14 4 percent of subprime ARMs were delinquent   The subprime market now accounts for more than 60 percent of foreclosures            Senator Hillary Clinton today announced a new initiative to address the growing crisis in the subprime mortgage lending market          Expand Access to Independent Face to Face Counseling   Senator Clinton underscored the need to ensure that financial counseling is available to borrowers before they take out mortgages   In particular  Senator Clinton emphasized the need to expand access to programs and initiatives that assist at risk borrowers    These initiatives  such as the National Community Reinvestment Coalition s  Consumer Rescue Fund  can provide borrowers unbiased advice on lenders  loan types  refinancing options  etc   Studies have shown that pre purchase  face to face counseling lowers delinquency and default rates  Many borrowers fail to appreciate the significant financial responsibilities that come with a mortgage  they fail to manage their finances appropriately to meet those responsibilities  or they simply do not understand the loan terms   Large numbers of unsuspecting people are also  steered  to sub prime mortgages even when they qualify for lower cost ones            Encourage Refinancing When the Loan Floats or Payment Shock Hits   Senator Clinton proposed limiting the length of time for which prepayment penalties apply  and prohibiting prepayment penalties on mortgages with rates above a specified level   She emphasized that 70 percent of sub prime mortgages have prepayment penalties  but less than 5 percent of prime mortgages do  Loans with prepayment penalties have 52 percent greater default risk according to findings by the Center for Responsible Lending and the National Low Income Housing Coalition    Some adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs  have prepayment penalties that extend beyond the fixed rate period  making it difficult for borrowers to avoid incurring the higher floating rate payments             Require  Plain Talk  No Fine Print Disclosure   Senator Clinton underscored that the protections offered by the Truth in Lending Act and existing federal regulations should be strengthened  Mortgage lenders should clearly and explicitly explain the risks and costs of mortgages  In particular  there should be  plain talk  disclosure of payment escalations on ARMs  prepayment penalties  balloon payments  the price premiums on reduced documentation loans  and the cost of taxes and insurance which are not included in the mortgage payments           Promote Foreclosure Timeout   Senator Clinton discussed creating incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and sit down with borrowers and try to figure out a way to restructure the loans before foreclosing   One option would be to give borrowers some period of forbearance in which they could get their financial house in order before resuming their mortgage payments   When a homeowner is having trouble making mortgage payments  some financial institutions sit down with borrowers to try to restructure the loans and figure out ways for borrowers to make their payments   In too many cases  however  homeowners don t reach out to their lenders and simply default after missing their payments  ultimately losing their homes            Strengthen the Federal Housing Administration s Mortgage Insurance Program    Senator Clinton called for passage of legislation she has proposed  the 21 st Century Housing Act  which strengthens the FHA  makes FHA loans available to more Americans  and expands access to a responsible and stable alternative to the subprime market   Senator Clinton s bill also would raise existing FHA mortgage limits in high cost areas like New York and California  making FHA an option for borrowers in those places   In addition  her bill would allow the FHA to reinvest a portion of its revenue in hiring more employees  upgrading its IT systems  and taking other steps to improve its operating infrastructure   These initiatives would position the FHA to work more efficiently with lenders  develop new mortgage products  and serve a larger number of borrowers            Homebuyers who do not qualify for conventional mortgages are the most common users of FHA backed mortgages   This population of first time buyers  many of whom are low  or moderate income  and minority  is essentially the same that turns to the subprime market   FHA insurance makes it possible for private lenders to provide mortgages to lower income families without attaching the rates and fees that sub prime lenders do  FHA s market share  however  has been dropping in recent years  In the 1990s FHA loans were about 12 percent of the market  today  they are closer to three percent  Strengthening the FHA would provide more homebuyers an alternative to the subprime market          ,0
1811,"SEN. SANDERS JOINS EFFORT TO ADDRESS DEFICIENCIES AT WALTER REED, IMPROVE CARE FOR RETURNING SERVICE MEMBERS
  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) today joined Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Claire McCaskill in sponsoring the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act, legislation which would help to ensure that service members at Walter Reed and elsewhere receive the treatment, care, and services they deserve. The bill requires immediate improvements to the Walter Reed Medical Center and directs the DOD to slash red tape and reduce the logistical, financial and emotional burdens the current system places on recovering service members and their families. Sanders visited the Walter Reed facility, including Building 18, yesterday and met with soldiers, families, and officials. 
   Sanders, a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs said, ""The conditions brought to light in the recent Washington Post series on the residential facilities are appalling and absolutely unacceptable. The brave men and women who have served this country deserve the best medical and mental health care available and this legislation will help ensure that they receive the treatment and services they deserve. Sadly, these problems at America's flagship military hospital are symptomatic of the absolute failure of the Administration to provide the care and benefits that our current service members and our veterans have earned through their sacrifice for the nation.""  
   Specifically, the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act will require improvements to facilities and inspections; reduce paperwork and eliminate red tape for recovering service members; and improve counseling services for soldiers their families. The bill also provides for a Wounded Warrior Oversight Group to monitor progress and ensure that our recovering service members receive the highest quality of care. 
   Sanders said, ""I am even more dismayed by today's Washington Post article, which concludes that high ranking officials in the Administration knew of the problems at Walter Reed and did nothing to rectify them. Our soldiers deserve better and we must act immediately to make sure the government stands by them throughout their recovery process at home."" 
   During Sanders visit to the Walter Reed Medical Center, he examined the conditions at the center and visited with the wife of Sergeant Archie Benware, an injured service member from Bethel, Vermont who is currently receiving treatment at Walter Reed. 
   A summary of the bill is below and a copy of the legislation is attached (see http://www.sanders.senate.gov/files/ARM07520_xml.pdf). 
   DIGNITY FOR WOUNDED WARRIORS ACT 
   The ""Dignity for Wounded Warriors"" Act ensures that wounded service members receive the treatment, care and services they deserve. The bill will require improved facilities and robust inspections; will reduce paperwork and eliminate red tape for recovering service members; provide improved counseling services for servicemembers and their families; and give improved support for families of recovering servicemembers. The bill also provides for a Wounded Warrior Oversight Group to monitor the progress and ensure that the nation's recovering service members receive the highest quality of care possible. 
   Ensuring Safe, Clean Housing: 
   The Washington Post revealed unacceptable living conditions for many outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the flagship military hospital, including moldy walls, broken elevators, and general disrepair in recovering servicemember barracks. The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act: 
   * Establishes standards for military outpatient housing - including that outpatient dormitories must match the existing service standard for active-duty barracks - and that repair requests must be completed within 15 days or alternate housing must be offered. 
   * Establishes a zero-tolerance policy for pest infestation. 
   * Creates an inspection regime to ensure high-level military officials are aware of problems at medical facilities. 
   * Requires an EMT and Crisis Counselor at all outpatient residences 24 hours a day. 
   Reducing Paperwork and Bureaucracy: 
   It takes an average of 209 days for soldiers to go through the process of determining whether or not they can remain in the military and, if not, at what level of disability they will be assessed and discharged. This process is made more complicated with duplicative requirements, extensive paperwork, and inefficient case management. The bill: 
   * Brings the Physical Disability Evaluation System (PDES) under one command to reduce bureaucratic red tape and unnecessary delays. 
   * Calls for injury-specific PDES procedures to allow the most severely injured service members to bypass unnecessary and lengthy steps. 
   * Requires that PDES system be available and accessible entirely online so that service members and case managers can more easily complete paperwork requirements. 
   * Requires a single location for PDES processing at hospitals that serve more than 100 recovering servicemembers. 
   * Requires the Pentagon to identify and implement other ways to streamline PDES. 
   Improving Casework: 
   Some caseworkers at Walter Reed have to care for 50 or more recovering soldiers, helping them schedule appointments, caring for their everyday needs, and helping fill out paperwork. Military caseworkers are overwhelmed, leading to some service members falling through the cracks. The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act: 
   * Increases the number of caseworkers. 
   * Establishes an interim ratio of 1 caseworker and 1 supervising NCO for each 20 recovering service members. 
   * Requires that the Pentagon establish target ratios for each military treatment facility according requirements of the patient population. 
   * Requires an evaluation of staff training and requires special focus on training for identification of mental illness and suicide prevention. 
   Caring for Family Members: 
   Family members often have to leave behind jobs to care for injured servicemembers. If they are not beneficiaries, they often have to pay for their own medical care, and face confusing bureaucracy and inadequate support. The Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act: 
   * Provides federal protections for the jobs of family members who are caring for recovering servicemembers, so they do not have to choose between caring for their loved one and keeping their job. 
   * Extends medical care to family members while they are living at military treatment facilities. 
   * Extends employment services to care-giving family members. 
   * Strengthens existing anonymous crisis counseling and respite services. 
   Increasing Availability of Information and Assistance: 
   Wounded troops and their families often have trouble understanding the bureaucratic process of getting care and determining whether they can stay in the military. The bill: 
   * Creates 2 new 24 hour bi-lingual hotlines (a crisis counseling hotline and a family assistance and respite hotline). 
   * Requires the creation of a single manual for outpatient care procedures, including PDES, family support, personnel processing and finance requirements and requires that it be made available online. 
   * Establishes an ""ombudsman"" for recovering servicemember outpatient care in each major medical command. 
   * Increases feedback outlets including requiring monthly town halls, and development of new anonymous feedback outlets. 
    Creation of an Oversight Board: 
   One of the fundamental causes of the problems at Walter Reed was a lack of accountability. The Dignity in Care Act: 
   * Creates a Wounded Warrior Oversight Board appointed by Congressional leadership that will oversee implementation of the act and serve as a constant advocate for recovering servicemembers into the future.

28,   Obama Asks Rice to Address Violence Against Women in the Congo   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Asks Rice to Address Violence Against Women in the Congo Thursday  October 11  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511                                                         WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today wrote to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressing his concerns about the growing number of systematic sexual assaults against women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago  Obama asked Secretary Rice to answer a series of questions about the situation in the DRC and what the United States government is doing to help curb this violence against women  In December of 2005  Obama introduced The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo  The legislation was signed into law on December 22  2006    Below is a copy of the letter  October 10  2007    The Honorable Condoleezza Rice   Secretary of State  Department of State  Washington  D C  20520   Dear Secretary Rice     I am writing to express my concern about the escalation of sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo  DRC  since armed conflicts erupted again there six weeks ago      The violence has been marked  in particular  by systematic sexual assaults against women   In 2004  Amnesty International estimated that at least 40 000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the DRC since 1998   In 2006  the United Nations reported 27 000 sexual assaults against women and girls in South Kivu province alone   Human Rights Watch has documented cases of rape victims as young as three years old   The New York Times recently reported that  in one town in the DRC  70 percent of Congolese women reported being sexually brutalized   The perpetrators     including disgruntled government soldiers  homegrown militia groups  and former Hutu militiamen who fled into Congo s forests after participating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide     have sustained their armed conflicts by exploiting the country s natural resources  raiding villages and committing violent atrocities    The Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief  Security and Democracy Promotion Act  which I introduced in December 2005 and which was signed into law by President Bush on December 22  2006  identifies such systematic sexual violence as a particular threat in Congo   That law states  in part  that U S  policy shall be to     urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces  hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations  particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war  accountable and bring such individuals to justice        help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health  education  and psycho social support programs        work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  MONUC  to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards  promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions  and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo       In that regard  I ask that you provide responses to the following questions     1     Do you have reason to believe that any DRC armed forces have been involved in mass rapes in the eastern DRC during the recent violence      2     What mechanisms exist to investigate and report on allegations of such violence     3     What  if any  investigations have been undertaken  and what have been the results of such investigations      4     To date  have any individuals been held accountable for such violence     5     What is the nature of U S  support for efforts to build the new Congolese armed forces and what elements of that support  if any  raise awareness about the importance of this issue of sexual violence      6     Is any U S  support contingent on the DRC government taking steps to address this issue     7     What steps  if any  is the U S  taking diplomatically to develop a consensus position among all donors contributing to the rebuilding of the Congolese armed force about the importance of addressing sexual violence     8     What resources has the United States government dedicated to victims of sexual violence over the course of the last six years     9     How is the U S  ensuring that the UN  and all countries that contribute troops to MONUC  are abiding by codes of conduct for the prevention of sexual abuse and trafficking     I thank you in advance for the consideration of these questions  and I look forward to your prompt reply    Sincerely     Barack Obama   United States Senator                                  ,1
363,   Obama  FCC Policies Must Encourage Media Ownership Diversity   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  FCC Policies Must Encourage Media Ownership Diversity Monday  October 22  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 FCC Rule Changes Must First Assess and Address Minority Media Ownership WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Federal Communications Commission  FCC  Chairman Kevin J  Martin  calling on him to launch an independent review panel to develop proposals to further promote media ownership diversity   According to press accounts  following an insufficient 30 day review  the FCC intends to modify existing ownership rules by allowing greater media market consolidation   This would allow large media outlets to become larger  potentially cutting out small business  women and minority owned firms   Minority owned and operated newspapers and radio stations play an important role in the African American and Latino communities and help bring minority issues to the forefront of our national dialogue   However  the Commission has failed to recognize the vital role these outlets play in our democracy and has not done enough to further the goals of diversity in the media  In the letter  Obama also asks for the FCC to reconsider the Chairman   s proposed consolidation timeline and start a public review of any specific proposed rule modifications   He also asks Martin to complete a study of the responsibilities that broadcasters have to the communities in which they operate   Obama and Senator John Kerry have previously written to Kevin Martin asking him to address the issue of minority media ownership  and the impact that new rules would have on opportunities for minority  small business  and women owned firms   The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Martin    I am writing regarding your proposal to move forward aggressively with modifications to existing media ownership rules   According to press accounts  you intend to present specific changes to existing rules in November with a Commission vote on that proposal     whatever it may be     on December 18  2007   I believe both the proposed timeline and process are irresponsible    Minority owned and operated newspapers and radio stations play a critical role in the African American and Latino communities and bring minority issues to the forefront of our national discussion   However  the Commission has failed to further the goals of diversity in the media and promote localism  and as a result  it is in no position to justify allowing for increased consolidation of the market   Moreover  30 days of public review of a specific proposed change is insufficient to assess the effect that change would have on the media marketplace or the rationale on which any such proposal is based   While the FCC did commission two studies on minority ownership in the round of 10 studies it ordered at the beginning of 2007  both suffered from the same problem     inadequate data from which to make determinations on the status of minority media ownership or the causes for that status and ways to increase representation    It is time to put together an independent panel  as Commissioner Adelstein has recommended  to issue a specific proposal for furthering the goal of diversity in media ownership   I object to the agency moving forward to allow greater consolidation in the media market without first fully understanding how that would limit opportunities for minority  small business  and women owned firms  I also object to the Commission   s propensity to vet proposals through leaks to the press and lobbyists   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  issued a report in September 2007 titled     The FCC Should Take Steps to Ensure Equal Access to Rulemaking Information      In that report  GAO found that      Situations where some  but not all  stakeholders know what the FCC is considering for an upcoming vote undermine fairness and transparency of the process and constitute a violation of the FCC   s rules      The report went on to state      This imbalance of information is not the intended result of the Communications Act and it runs contrary to the principles of transparency and equal opportunity for participation established by law and to the FCC   s own rules that govern rulemaking     In the wake of that report  I find it disturbing that  according to the New York Times  the Commission is considering repealing the newspaper and television cross ownership rules   It is unclear what your intent is on the rest of the media ownership regulations   Repealing the cross ownership rules and retaining the rest of our existing regulations is not a proposal that has been put out for public comment  the proper process for vetting it is not in closed door meetings with lobbyists or in selective leaks to the New York Times    Although such a proposal may pass the muster of a federal court  Congress and the public have the right to review any specific proposal and decide whether or not it constitutes sound policy   And the Commission has the responsibility to defend any new proposal in public discourse and debate    This is not the first time I have communicated with the agency on this matter   Senator Kerry and I wrote to you on July 20  2006  stating that the Commission needed to address and complete a proceeding on issues of minority and small business media ownership before taking up the wider media ownership rules   Our request echoed an amendment adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee in June 2006   And last month  at an FCC hearing on media ownership held in Chicago  I requested that the FCC put out any specific changes that would be voted on in a new notice of proposed rulemaking so that the American people have an opportunity to review it    In closing  I ask you to reconsider your proposed timeline  put out any specific change to the rules for public comment and review  move to establish an independent panel on minority and small business media ownership  and complete a proceeding on the responsibilities that broadcasters have to the communities in which they operate

  The Senate tonight approved legislation cosponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders that would establish an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate U.S. wartime contracting abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   ""The evidence is clear that taxpayers are being ripped off for billions of dollars in no-bid contracts awarded to Halliburton and other firms,"" Sanders said. ""Astonishingly, we know that $9 billion spent on private contractors in Iraq is missing. We owe it to taxpayers to take a long, hard look at the conduct of contractors.""
   Added to a Department of Defense policy bill that the Senate is considering, the amendment creating a Commission on Wartime Contracting would address rampant corruption and other problems with private companies operating in Iraq.
   The measure also would expand the authority of a special inspector general to monitor all wartime contracts in Afghanistan as well as Iraq. In Iraq alone, it was the special inspector general who discovered that $9 billion in reconstruction funds simply had vanished. 
   Halliburton, the gargantuan defense contractor that Vice President Cheney once headed, is an example of the private companies that have been awarded huge, no-bid contracts in Iraq. ""More than ever before in our history, the Bush administration has doled out millions and millions of dollars worth of no-bid contracts to Halliburton and other private firms operating in war zones,"" Sanders said.
   The Commission is also would identify new safeguards for companies that provide private security guards, such as the security contractor Blackwater, which is under investigation in the shooting deaths of 11 Iraqis earlier this month and over a 2004 ambush in which four of its staff were killed. ""I fail to understand how the Secret Service is good enough to protect the president, but we need to use contractors to protect our diplomats in Iraq,"" said Sanders. ""I fail to understand how the Secret Service is good enough to protect the president, but we need to use contractors to protect our diplomats in Iraq.""
   The legislation to create the commission - originally sponsored by Senators Jim Webb, Claire McCaskill, Sanders and other freshmen senators - was inspired by the World War II-era work of the ""Truman Committee."" Named for then-Senator Harry S Truman, the committee conducted hundreds of hearings and investigations into government waste and is credited with saving taxpayers more than $15 billion in 1943 dollars. 
   In the current conflict in Iraq, which already has dragged on for longer than World War II, the United States to date has spent $610 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some 160,000 contractors work in Iraq today, 20,000-30,000 working on private security. The commission would investigate waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement of the contracts and contractors.
   The legislation was supported of taxpayer watchdog groups, such as the Project on Government Oversight, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Government Accountability Project, OMB Watch, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

1712,"LOG JAM IN WASHINGTON
  Republican filibusters and Presidential vetoes have created a backlog of important legislation stalled in Congress. The President continues to veto, and threaten to veto, critical legislation that would make a real difference in the lives of Americans. Senator Sanders said, ""I find it very objectionable that President Bush, who signed every piece of legislation passed by the Republican controlled Congress, now wants to veto bills because we're trying to expand children's health insurance or make sure that Americans don't go cold in the winter. That's an absurd set of priorities, and I hope the President begins working with Congress, rather than playing partisan games."" 
   Friday, Senate Republicans again made sure that Senators were not allowed to even vote on important legislation. After the House passed an energy bill last week which would have increased fuel efficiency standards in cars and trucks for the first time since 1975 and created tax incentives to increase production of renewable fuels, the Senate Republicans filibustered. Again. They have filibustered 58 times in less than one year in the minority, already closing in on the 61-filibuster record for a full two-year session.
   For this very reason, the Senate has not even been able to vote yet on legislation to bring our soldiers home from Iraq.
   Last week we saw a long-term solution to the pending Alternative Minimum Tax crisis stopped; the much-needed Farm Bill has been stalled for about a month; and it is unclear what the next step in the process of completing energy legislation is. The only thing the Senate did get done was a disastrous free trade agreement with Peru.
   Let's hope these and other key responsibilities can be addressed before Congress adjourns. Stay tuned.

1498,November 18  2005 Clinton  Dewine  Obama  Smith Introduce Legislation To Help Property Owners Safeguard Against Lead Hazards In The Home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Today  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Mike DeWine  R OH   Barack Obama  D IL  and Gordon Smith  R OR  introduced legislation providing a tax credit for safely removing lead based paint hazards from homes and rental units   This bipartisan bill would provide needed incentives for property owners to ensure that homes are free of environmental hazards that can harm children          This bill will help to achieve the federal government  s established goal of eliminating toxic blood levels in young children by 2010   Exposure in the home is the number one source of lead for young children   By providing financial incentives to remove lead hazards from the home  exposure will be minimized and this disease  which is known to have incredibly harmful effects on child development  behavior and intelligence  can be prevented   We need to continue to work to end childhood lead poisoning and to ensure safe and healthy environments for our children     said Senator Clinton          As parents  we try to protect our kids as much as possible when they walk out the front door  when they  re on the roads  or when they  re on the playground with friends   But one of the biggest health risks to our kids can occur inside the home     said Senator DeWine     Dangerous lead paint exposures are entirely preventable   It just makes sense that we encourage parents to remove this hazard and protect our children             As both a father of two young daughters and a lawmaker  it pains me to think that each year nearly 28 000 children needlessly suffer from lead paint poisoning     said Obama   We need to take immediate action to protect our children by ensuring that dangerous lead paint is cleaned up properly             Lead poisoning is all the more tragic because it is preventable     Smith said     The homes where lead paint is most common are often the ones with families who lack the resources to remove it   It will take years to entirely remove this hazard  but we can get it done more quickly with a boost in financial support           This bill would change the IRS code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for 50  of the allowable costs paid by the taxpayer  up to a maximum of  3000 for lead abatement and  1000 for interim control measures  which could include window replacement  safe repainting and specialized renovation work practices to reduce lead hazards   These are cost effective means of protecting the largest number of children in the near term   The credit is targeted to homes with children younger than six years of age  women of childbearing age  low income residents  and buildings built before 1960  as these include more than 96  of all units where lead based paint is prevalent         Lead is highly toxic and continues to be a major preventable environmental health threat especially to infants  children  and pregnant women in the United States   Lead poisoning can be deadly  and almost one million children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  that can impair their growth and the function of vital organs and motor skills   The most common source of lead exposure for children today is lead paint in older housing and the contaminated lead dust it generates   Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still millions of housing units in the United States that contain lead paint  especially in older homes           In New York State  about five percent of children screened for lead poisoning at age two were found to have elevated blood lead levels  more than twice the national average   New York counties where kids are especially at risk include  Onondaga  Fulton  Monroe  Erie  and Oneida   Approximately 10 000 cases of childhood lead poisoning in New York are found each year   Minority and poor children are disproportionately at risk   For example  in New York City  about 95  of children with elevated blood levels were African American  Hispanic or Asian        Illinois has the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  According to an Illinois Department of Public Health report  Illinois amounted to 20 5 percent of all elevated blood levels reported nationwide  The report also found that African American children are more than three times as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels and Hispanic children are more than twice as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels        Senator Clinton and her colleagues have a strong record of advocacy on environmental health issues  Earlier this year  Senators Clinton and DeWine introduced the Family Asthma Act  which seeks to increase research into the links between environmental pollutants and the growing epidemic of asthma  And yesterday  Senators Obama and Clinton introduced the Healthy Communities Act  which would establish Health Action Zones to address environmental health concerns in our nation s most affected communities  Senator Clinton has also introduced the bipartisan Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act to strengthen the environmental health tracking program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention               ,0
1721,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON TRADE DEAL
  Sen. Bernie Sanders issued the following statement regarding an agreement on trade pacts reached after secret negotiations by the Bush administration and congressional leaders: 
   ""At a time when the middle class is shrinking, and when we have lost millions of good paying jobs because of our disastrous trade policies, it is clear to me that Congress needs to make a fundamental re-examination of trade policies so that they represent the needs of American workers and not just large multinational corporations.
   ""Given the enormous importance of this issue, it is very disappointing that these negotiations took place behind closed doors and without more open discussion in the Senate and the House.
   ""As Vermont's Senator, I intend to see that this discussion takes place, and that the needs of ordinary Americans are put ahead of the needs of CEOs of large corporations.""

                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton met today with Admiral John O  Agwunobi Assistant Secretary for Health  United States Department of Health and Human Services to discuss the details of the Administration s recent commitment of  25 million for 9 11 healthcare           Last month  the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  indicated that they would make  25 million available in the President s Budget for Fiscal Year 2008  At the meeting today  the Senator presented Admiral Agwunobi with a letter detailing her concerns and questions about the funding which she still sees as insufficient to take care of the significant health needs that 9 11 workers  responders  residents  volunteers  students and others are facing           It was a pleasure to meet with Dr  Agwunobi today and to talk through the critical details of this funding  I was pleased when the Administration made the commitment to include  25 million in the FY 2008 Budget but I remain fundamentally convinced that it is simply not enough to take care of those who need it  I also think the devil is in the details and I want to work with Dr  Agwunobi to ensure that this funding goes exactly where it is needed in a timely way and without taking funds from other critical programs   Senator Clinton said        A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below       John O  Agwunobi  M D   Assistant Secretary for Health  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20201      Dear Dr  Agwunobi       I was very pleased to hear from Office of Management and Budget Director Portman last month that future funding has been promised  and I am pleased that we can meet to discuss this today          My central aim is to ensure that this is not a hollow promise            The  25 million is an important first step  however  it is not enough to meet the growing need   As Mayor Bloomberg pointed out yesterday  it will require far more to help provide the full assistance the responders and workers require  and we need to figure out a plan for the populations not currently eligible for the federally funded programs   residents  office workers and students            Further to my concerns that this funding is simply not enough  I have a number of questions which I would like answered about the nature of the funding itself and how it will be administered  which I think are also critical to the goal of providing the funds where they are most needed           In the President s FY 2008 Budget request  the  25 million was allocated to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund of the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   Can you confirm whether this amount will be directed through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH    The purpose of the money was to make sure the current programs are still able to treat their patients  so I want to make sure that it will not be administered through another structure to avoid any unnecessary delays in the funds being delivered          If currently existing programs need additional funds before the FY08 cycle  there was a commitment made by the Administration to provide it   Can you clarify where this money would come from   I want to ensure that it is not taken from what is left of the  90 million in medical monitoring money that I and others worked to secure            I understand that HHS is expected to come out with a report on 9 11 health issues in the near future   What do you hope to achieve by the report  and what is its current status          Finally  I will be holding a hearing through the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  HELP  on March 21st  and will be asking for HHS to testify   Mayor Bloomberg has already agreed to testify and I hope that HHS will as well          The Mayor s WTC Health Panel makes a strong case for why long term  sustained assistance is needed from the federal government   The report makes some critical recommendations on what should be done to help take care of those who are suffering devastating health effects as a result of 9 11  and I look forward to working with you on their implementation            The federal government has a responsibility to our 9 11 heroes to make sure there is adequate funding to meet the growing need   Just as we are beginning to fully realize the extent of the damage that was done to the health of those at Ground Zero  the very program that is treating their conditions faces an uncertain future   We cannot allow these critical healthcare services to cease operating due to lack of support   These brave  selfless men and women need our help and we must continue to uphold our commitment to them          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton        Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the health effects of 9 11          ,0
643,   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Destruction of CIA Interrogation Tapes   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Statement of Senator Barack Obama on Destruction of CIA Interrogation Tapes Friday  December  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 The following statement was submitted by Senator Obama in the Congressional Record today  Mr  President  I wish to express my serious concern over the Central Intelligence Agency   s confirmation that videotapes depicting brutal interrogation techniques were destroyed   First  it is important that we note the broader context of this debate  The United States of America is a nation born out of a struggle against tyranny  and our founding legal document asserts that the rule of law applies to all men and women  and all branches and agencies of government  We are not a perfect nation  but our national greatness is marked by our ability to rise above our imperfections through our allegiance to our values and to the rule of law  Time and again  America has triumphed because of the contrast we draw to tyranny  We are a nation that set captives free  shut down torture chambers  and extended freedom and international law to more of humanity   Now  we are engaged in a new kind of conflict  And the question that we have faced since September 11  2001  is how we are going to respond to the shadowy  stateless  terrorist enemies of the 21st century   Tragically  the Bush Administration has too often chosen to respond to this enemy by abandoning our values and ignoring laws that it deems inconvenient  So we have seen excessive secrecy  indefinite detention  warrantless wire tapping  and    enhanced interrogation techniques    like simulated drowning that qualify as torture through any careful measure of the law or appeal to human decency  For each of these new policies  we have seen dubious legal reasoning that does not stand up to the harsh light of review or the sound judgment of our Constitution   Yesterday  we learned that in November 2005  the CIA destroyed videotapes of its interrogations of two prominent al Qaeda suspects  including a close Osama bin Laden associate     Abu Zubayadah  Media reports suggest that these videotapes depict brutal interrogation techniques  and could certainly be relevant to ongoing investigations and inquiries  Furthermore  these videotapes were not provided to the 9 11 Commission  which made a broad set of requests for classified documents     including interrogation tapes and transcripts     that would have included information about the 9 11 attacks   The CIA has argued that these tapes needed to be destroyed to protect the identities of the interrogators  Our government must go to any length necessary to protect the identities of those who serve in a covert capacity  But the CIA keeps scores of classified material     including videotapes     while protecting the identities of its agents  This raises serious questions about whether the tapes were destroyed to protect the nature of the interrogation  rather than the identity of the interrogator   Mr  President  this incident deserves further congressional oversight and inquiry     neither the CIA nor this interrogation program is immune to our laws  This is yet another chapter in a dark period in our constitutional history  Now  it is time to turn the page  That is why I was heartened to learn that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have reached agreement on including a requirement in the Intelligence Authorization bill that subjects CIA interrogators to the guidelines on interrogation included in the U S  Army Field Manual  It would be a grave disappointment     though not surprising     if this important step forward were subject to a veto threat from the President  That must not deter the Congress from moving forward  We have a responsibility to act   We should not have a separate interrogation program whose methods are so abhorrent that they cannot stand up to scrutiny  We should not have to find ways of ignoring or averting our own laws to defend our country  Torture does not work  Torture violates our laws  And torture sets back the standing and moral leadership that America needs to triumph in this global struggle  Our values and laws are not inconvenient obstacles to the defense of our national security     they can and must be a guiding force in our response to terrorism  Mr  President  today is Pearl Harbor day     a date when our nation was subjected to a terrible surprise attack  and when a generation of Americans answered the call to defend our security and extend the cause of freedom  More than six years after 9 11  we are still struggling to define our own response to our generation   s terrible surprise attack  As we defend America  let us learn the painful lessons of these last few years  and enlist our values and our Constitution in this first great struggle of the 21st century   I thank the President and yield the floor                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of

1809,"AS BIG OIL PROFITS SOAR, SEN. SANDERS CALLS FOR WINDFALL PROFITS TAX, OPEC SANCTIONS, MERGER MORATORIUM
  Boosted by gushing oil prices, Exxon Mobil's $40.6 billion in 2007 profits exceeded the company's own record for a U.S. corporation. Chevron also reported huge profits. At a meeting in Vienna of the international oil cartel, meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies kept production quotas steady. 
   Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said: ""It is absurd for oil companies like Exxon Mobil to be raking in obscene profits while millions of Americans are struggling to pay skyrocketing gas and home heating oil prices. We owe it to the American people to do everything we can to stop big oil companies from ripping off American consumers.
   ""Since 2001, Big Oil has earned more than half-a-trillion dollars in profits, but devoted less than a penny per gallon to produce clean and affordable renewable fuels in this country to reduce Americans' dependency on oil. Instead, the president and his allies in Congress blocked efforts to repeal oil company tax breaks and devote those resources to incentives for the production of energy efficient vehicles and renewable energy,"" Sanders added.
   Congress should renew those efforts this year, he added, and also take these steps to rein in prices for petroleum products:
   * Impose a windfall profits tax on the oil companies. Revenue from a windfall profits tax could make a substantial down payment on meeting the urgent need to repair crumbling roads, bridges, and highways. 
   * Urge the president to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization against OPEC for illegally colluding to raise oil prices. ""It's time the wealthy OPEC cartel obeyed international law and stop manipulating the price of oil,"" Sanders said. 
   * Place a moratorium on big oil company mergers and give serious consideration to breaking up some of the biggest oil companies in this country, including Exxon Mobil, Conoco-Phillips and Chevron-Texaco.

1768,"SEN. SANDERS GIVES FIRST SENATE FLOOR SPEECH ON ETHICS LEGISLATION
  Sen. Bernie Sanders today gave his first statement on the floor of the Senate as part of the debate on the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007 (S.1). In the speech Sanders discussed the importance of reining in the influence and power that lobbyists and their large corporate clients have over Congress and offered an amendment to address this problem.  
   Sanders said, ""Time and time again, the Congress has chosen to ignore the views of the American people and instead act in the interest of the wealthy special interests. This has included a Medicare Part D prescription drug program that did nothing to lower prices for consumers, energy bills that include huge tax giveaways to Big Oil and other interests, and the failure to pass legislation that would allow for the reimportation of safe, affordable prescription drugs from well-regulated countries like Canada. It is long past time for this Congress to ensure that they are looking out for the needs or working Americans, and not corporate lobbyists. What this report will do is begin to shed some light on the extent that contributions by corporate interests influence legislation before Congress."" 
   Specifically, Sanders' amendment would require a congressional commission to produce a report following the passage of the ethics legislation which would detail the number of political contributions given by certain industry associations to members of the House and Senate. The report would be produced by the Commission to Strengthen Confidence in Congress, a commission created with the passage of S.1. 
   Sanders said, ""The challenge we face is to rein in the influence and power that lobbyists and their large corporate clients have over the Congress. The lobbying reform legislation that we are considering is a very important step. But we must keep in mind while we are eliminating the $20 lunches and the club level tickets to local sporting events, we are doing nothing about the $10,000 campaign contributions that come from corporate PACs.

   Senator Bernie Sanders said, ""This program helps to return these sites to productive uses, creating new jobs, generating additional tax revenues, protecting the environment, and improving communities' overall quality of life."" Sanders, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, has also urged the Senate to fully fund the brownfields program.
   Rep. Peter Welch said, ""Brownfield redevelopment is a win-win for Vermont by promoting local economic development while helping clean up the environment in our communities.""

                 Washington  DC    With the United States Army straining to meet its current obligations and the National Guard and Reserves stretched to the limit  Senators Joseph Lieberman  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Bill Nelson and Jack Reed and Representatives Ellen Tauscher and Mark Udall today announced that they will introduce legislation to significantly increase the Army  s baseline troop strength   The United States Army Relief Act will boost the overall troop levels authorized by Congress by 20 000 active duty members per year over the next four years  giving the Army the breathing room to reduce the overburden on our active duty troops as well as our Guard and Reserve and rebuild our capacity to respond to future threats             The United States Army is facing a crisis today     Senator Lieberman said     It is not a crisis of quality  bravery or commitment  Our Army is a magnificent force and the men and women in today  s Army are as good as any who have ever worn the uniform   The crisis is there simply are not enough of them                To protect our country in the post 9 11 world  we need an Army large enough to respond to threats wherever danger lies  but the strain on our Army and our over reliance on our Guard and Reserves are pushing our capacity to the breaking point     said Senator Clinton     We need to get serious about addressing this challenge and this legislation is an important step in the right direction                We have an opportunity to increase the effectiveness of the Army and alleviate the stress placed on the National Guard and Army Reserves due to the long term commitment the Administration has made in Iraq     Senator Reed stated     While increasing the size of the Army is absolutely necessary to maintain our commitments across the globe  it is also critical that the increase  s funding is provided in the annual Defense Authorization budget rather than relying on continued supplemental after supplemental                The Army is being asked to do too much with too few people in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere     said Senator Nelson     At the same time  the United States must be prepared to meet a broader range of threats   anywhere in the world  especially from terrorists             Since 1945  the size of the active duty Army has dropped in times of peace and spiked during wartime   At the end of the Cold War  the Army shrank as part of the   peace dividend      However  now  in a time of war  the size of our Army has not followed the historic precedent of increasing to meet the demands placed on it   While we have increased defense spending since September 11  permanent troop levels have not risen accordingly                         Without increasing troop levels  the force requirements of the ongoing operations in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere as part of the Global War on Terror are unsustainable   There are currently approximately 499 000 active duty Army troops backed up by nearly 700 000 National Guard and Army reservists  a third less than the force level on hand when the first Gulf War was fought in 1991   This relationship between the total number of troops versus the number of operationally deployed troops has resulted in an active duty force that is stretched to the limit           In addition to hampering the military  s ability to successfully complete the missions assigned to it  this overuse has significant consequences for domestic homeland security operations   A disproportionate number of federal  state and local first responders are also Guard and Reserve members   At a time of strain for large municipalities struggling to secure their infrastructure against the threat of terrorism  the drain on available personnel as well as budgets is unacceptable             In announcing the legislation  the Members of Congress emphasized that this prolonged strain on our active duty members of the Army and our Guard and Reserves is damaging the long term ability of these components to operate effectively   Increased force requirements since September 11 have resulted in soldiers facing constant deployments into war zones without rest  training and preparation   The Guard and Reserve have been strained to the breaking point for years on end   To continue to retain and recruit the high quality soldiers we need for our 21st century fighting force  we must slow down their deployment schedules and make them more predictable             As a member of the House Armed Services Committee  I have long sought solutions to relieve our overstretched military and give us enough troops to meet current and new threats to the United States   Raising the cap on the size of the U S  Army will reduce the need for back to back tours  stop loss orders  and lengthy  unpredictable deployments  making the military a more attractive place to serve   It  s critical that we combat the recruitment and retention problems that threaten to break our all volunteer Army by reducing the overwhelming burden placed on the shoulders of such a small number of soldiers     said Representative Ellen O  Tauscher                    The war in Iraq has put a tremendous strain on our Army  Our troops are overstretched   not just in Iraq and Afghanistan but in 117 other countries around the world   and unprepared to meet potential future threats   Additionally  we continue to rely too heavily on our Guard and Reserve  Our troop levels should reflect the fact that we are at war   said Representative Udall    Without this bill  we risk asking too much of our men and women in uniform who have performed so courageously and sacrificed so much in their service to this country  They  future recruits  and the country all need to know that we are committed to providing the resources necessary to keep our Army strong            In order for the Army to fulfill its operational requirements today as well as face the contingencies of the future  it must be larger   Some progress was made toward this goal when Congress authorized an increase of 20 000 troops   However  this increase was not enough to provide the long term relief or support that the Army requires in order to fulfill its mission   In order to provide a lasting  long term solution to the Army  s challenges  an additional increase of 80 000 troops is required   This number will equip the Army with sufficient personnel so that it may not only engage in a stabilization operation like Iraq  but so that it may do so while maintaining optimal troop rotation

1956,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON COST OF IRAQ WAR
  Statement by Sen. Bernie Sanders at Budget Committee hearing on cost of Iraq war:
  Today is the first Budget Committee hearing since yesterday's release of the President's federal budget proposal for fiscal year 2008. The hearing correctly focuses on a very important issue facing the U.S. Senate and our nation: the Iraq War and its costs.
   This war has great human costs, as we see and hear each day from reports overseas. This is a war that has cost us terribly in American blood. As of today, we have lost some 3,100 brave American soldiers, 23,000 more have been wounded and tens of thousands will come home with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD. 
   The human costs are also felt hear at home. First, returning personnel, our veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan war, have very real needs. Let me say here, as I have said before, that our veterans must receive adequate funding for their growing medical care and other needs.
   Second, without doubt, the war has consumed, and is consuming, vast sums of money. And these enormous budgetary costs are felt by the people of our county. Unfortunately, the President's budget, at best, represents an optimistic view of the true costs of war. His budget ignores some very real and tremendous amounts of money necessary not only to provide our troops what they would need for the so called surge, but also what they will need when they return home.
   BUDGET NUMBERS:
   First, let me repeat and reemphasize some of the numbers stated here today, rounded off a bit to keep things simple. The President has asked for $481 billion for the Pentagon. This is just more than half of the entire discretionary budget of the United States for the coming fiscal year. But this ignores all the money we spend on nuclear weapons, including cleaning up all of the old bomb factories and maintaining the nuclear weapons arsenal, which is about $14 billion.
   Even more important the number excludes all of the cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The President is asking for an additional $142 billion for the next fiscal year. This is in addition to the $93 billion in Supplemental Funding for this fiscal year. If you add it all up, the President has presented a request, a request we received just this month, for $730 billion for the military, including Iraq.
   These costs for the military do not come without real effects, real problems for the American people. We should also remember that the budget for our veterans and the costs of homeland security count in the budget as ""domestic"" spending. And our domestic spending is simply being squeezed thin.
   PRESIDENT'S BUDGET MEANS DOMESTIC CUTS:
   We have seen proposed cuts by the President. Many, many programs are on the chopping block. Just three quick examples: - the President's budget eliminate a vital food program for women with newborn children and for seniors, including many who happen to be veterans - the Commodity Supplemental Food Program at $108 million. - a $100 million cut for Head Start, at a time when only about one-half of the children eligible for this program actually participate due to a lack of funding. - at $8.9 million, the complete elimination of the Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Program even though this is obviously a need that has become even more important with the ongoing war in Iraq.
   IRAQ COSTS PER HOUR OR WEEK:
   By the way, there have been some rough calculations about the relative costs of the Iraq war on a yearly basis, and how much we spend every day or each hour on the war. As an illustration, our nation spends about $2 billion a week, or about $11 million an hour.
   So, for example, just: - ten hours in Iraq would pay for the entire Commodity Supplemental Food Program - Providing the additional funds to fully fund Head Start, for those who are eligible, for one year would be roughly $7.2 billion, a large figure, but only about four weeks in Iraq. - Providing the necessary funds to insure the 9 million children in this nation that would cost about $15 billion a year, or easily less than two months in Iraq.
   So these examples illustrate some real trade offs. Based on the President's budget request, we see some tough and painful cuts in vital needs for our country.
   However, I believe the President is, at best optimistic. The pain felt by the American people will be worse because the numbers are simply worse.

313,   Senators Urge GAO to Study the Military s Mental Health Care   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Urge GAO to Study the Military s Mental Health Care Thursday  April 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  Obama  Boxer  Bond  Akaka  Harkin  Lieberman  Murray  McCaskill  Sanders ask for review in light of troubling reports  WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Tom Harkin  D IA   Joe Lieberman  I CT   Patty Murray  D WA   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Bernie Sanders  I VT  today sent a letter to the General Accounting Office  GAO  requesting a review of the Department of Defense   s treatment of service related mental health conditions affecting troops that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan   The letter comes in the wake of reports of poor treatment and conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Centers  where many patients and family members described not receiving adequate mental health care  and more recent reports that suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has not effectively screened and diagnosed mental health conditions   Senators Boxer  Bond  and Obama had previously asked that the Department of Defense to examine command practices and culture related to mental health care with no response   As the DOD drags its feet  the senators have requested the GAO to investigate agency practices related to mental health screenings  diagnoses  referrals and treatment of service members    Recent reports suggest that the Department of Defense is ill equipped to effectively screen and diagnose the increasing number of service members who are suffering from mental health conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder     said Senator Obama      I m especially troubled by reports of some DOD commanders downplaying the serious mental health conditions confronting service members returning home from Iraq  and then redeploying those troops without proper treatment    It s time for a full accounting of how many of our troops are affected by post traumatic stress disorder  other service connected mental health conditions  and traumatic brain injuries  and for an evaluation of our readiness to help the generation of soldiers returning home from war rebuild their lives    Senator Boxer said   Two years ago  military doctors informed me that soldiers with serious mental health problems were being denied care and redeployed to Iraq   Sadly  even after we passed legislation and the Defense Department issued new mental health guidelines  they are not being followed   It is time for the GAO to investigate allegations of mistreatment and improper discharges   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans        Combat stress and its impact on our soldiers and their families is a serious problem that continues to grow   Reports that our military is unprepared or unwilling to deal with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome or other mental health problems are unacceptable   Being unprepared for these problems is no excuse for inaction  It is our duty to take care of the brave men and women who have answered the call to duty   said Senator Kit Bond       I am deeply concerned about the consequences of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan on the mental health of those who serve     said Senator Akaka      PTSD and other mental health problems  the often invisible wounds of war  can be terribly debilitating   As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Veterans    Affairs Committee  I am working to ensure that our wounded warriors receive a timely diagnosis of mental health problems and prompt and effective response   This effort must begin while servicemembers are still on active duty and there have been far too many reports that this is not happening   The results of this requested GAO review will be of great importance as we seek to ensure that DOD and VA meet the needs of our newest war veterans          With news that our soldiers will be serving longer tours of duty with shorter periods of rest at home  there is no better time to ensure the men and women who serve our country are getting the mental health services they need     said Senator Harkin     We must do away with the stigma associated with mental illness and remove any obstacles to treatment          We have a moral obligation to care for our wounded troops and ensure they receive the best care     said Senator Lieberman      Post traumatic stress disorder is afflicting many of our service members and it is imperative that we accurately and efficiently diagnose and treat it  The stakes are high for those that are sacrificing their lives for our country and we must work together to correct any deficiencies that we find in our military   s mental health system       We can t afford to wait until a year after our service members have returned home to discover the affects of the unseen wounds of this war   said Senator Murray   PTSD is taking a horrible toll on our service members and their families and we must be sure today that they are being properly screened  tracked  and treated  We can no longer be unprepared for this mounting problem        Our men and women returning from war should receive mental health care equal to the physical medical care they are given  and anything less is unacceptable     Senator McCaskill said      It took this country 15 years after Vietnam to look at the mental health needs of veterans   We can   t do that to another generation of soldiers          The men and women who put their lives on the line for this country deserve the best care we can provide     Senator Bernie Sanders said      What has been revealed about Defense Department health care is a disgrace that needs to be addressed   We need to find out whether there is a concerted effort by the Defense Department to shortchange our soldiers and veterans who are in need of mental health care and other benefits they have earned      The text of the letter is below  The Honorable David M  Walker   Comptroller General   Government Accountability Office  GAO    441 G Street  NW  Room 7125   Washington  DC 20548  Dear Mr  Walker    We are writing to request that the General Accounting Office  GAO  undertake a review of Department of Defense  DOD  screenings  diagnoses  referrals and treatment of service members who may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and other mental health conditions related to their service in Iraq and Afghanistan   Several of us previously wrote the DOD requesting an examination of command practices and reports of biases and misdiagnoses in the treatment of mental health related injuries such as PTSD and other deployment related health problems  including Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   but have not yet received a response    The stigmas associated with PTSD and other mental health needs are no less potent within the military than in the civilian world   Indeed  reports from soldiers suffering from PTSD suggest that the stigma is worse  with some military commanders appearing to minimize the significance of PTSD and other mental health needs  or suggesting that a service member is malingering to avoid redeployment   There are allegations of commanders at Fort Carson  Colorado denying soldiers access to mental health care and instead ordering them redeployed for additional tours in Iraq   We have also heard of cases in which service members with PTSD are diagnosed as having    personality disorders    that the Army considers    pre existing     thus depriving otherwise eligible combat veterans of disability benefits and much needed mental healthcare  Because the stakes for our service members    and their health are so high  we must move quickly to investigate and correct any deficiencies   We have come to learn about a number of upsetting allegations at Fort Carson   Therefore  for the purposes of an expedited review  we request to be briefed initially by GAO on these immediate cases   We ask that you subsequently focus your inquiry not only on Fort Carson but on system wide mental health deficiencies within the DOD   With the significant burdens already being placed on our service members and their families with multiple extended deployments  we must ensure that they are not further burdened with any humiliation  stigmatization or other minimization of genuine mental health needs  Our service members are risking their lives for our nation   s security  it is our moral obligation to care for them  We therefore ask the GAO to assess    Known cases of improper discharges or misdiagnoses and patterns of systematic stigmatization employed by military commanders regarding the mental health needs of service members throughout the chain of command at Fort Carson and across DOD departments   The growing number of discharges for personality disorders  and whether or not such discharges are being improperly used when service members should in fact be given a mental health diagnosis that DOD does not consider preexisting   The overall number of misdiagnosed cases of PTSD  other mental health conditions  and TBIs  at Fort Carson and force wide    DOD progress in implementing previous mandates to develop force wide criteria and procedures for screening  diagnosing and referring mental health cases for follow up treatment   The efficacy of the DOD   s current mental health safety net and treatment capabilities  for example  what current mechanisms are available to service members in the event of misdiagnosis    The steps and resources required to implement one on one  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members    The number of service members  men and women  reporting mental health concerns related to sexual assault during deployment  and whether current DOD personnel training and diagnostic guidance is sufficiently responsive to the needs of both men and women    We seek to ensure that the DOD has the resources necessary to diagnose and treat service connected injuries that impact the mental health of U S  service personnel  It is vital that the U S  military ensures it is treating the mental health needs of our forces with the same priority and resource investments it is devoting to physical injuries   If you would like to discuss this request  please contact  redacted   Thank you for your assistance in this matter                                   ,1
631,   Obama  Kerry  Domenici  Hagel Call on Pentagon to Ensure Quality Care for Returning Service Members with Eye Injuries   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama

 2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Liz Richardson  Kerry   Chris Gallegos  Domenici   or Mike Buttry  Hagel     WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   John Kerry  D MA   Pete Domenici  R NM  and Chuck Hagel  R NE  sent the following letter to the Assistant Defense Secretary for Health Affairs  Dr  S  Ward Casscells  calling on him to provide comprehensive information on eye injuries sustained by service members in Iraq and Afghanistan   According to the President   s Commission on Care for America   s Returning Wounded Warriors  48 cases of blinded service members have been reported  while other estimates show that the total number of vision related complications exceeds 1 000     especially when vision impairment resulting from Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs  is considered   However  based on current available information  there is a lack of comprehensive eye injury data as well as questions about the accuracy of these numbers   In continuing efforts to provide the best available care for our wounded warriors  it is imperative that we have an accurate system of accounting for these eye injuries so there can be sufficient planning and treatment    In the letter  the senators ask the Pentagon to provide the total number of eye injuries sustained in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  an estimate of the total number of eye injuries sustained that did not result in a medical evacuation  the number of cases of TBIs that also contained a diagnosis of a vision impairment  the number of eye injuries that required surgery in military medical facilities  and the number of blinded service members referred for either outpatient or inpatient Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitative Services or private agency rehabilitation      The very least we owe our men and women in uniform is the best health care we can provide     said Senator Obama      Whether these heroes are suffering from eye injuries or traumatic brain injuries that can lead to vision impairment  we have a commitment to provide them with the highest quality medical care both in combat and once they return home   The fact is  the story of eye injuries in this war has gone largely untold   To fully care for our veterans  we need to have a comprehensive understanding of the number of veterans affected  and I hope we receive this information from the Pentagon in a timely and efficient way         The best military medicine in the world is saving lives on the battlefield  but an antiquated health care system is failing our soldiers when they come home with complex eye and brain injuries  which are the hallmark wounds of this war     said Senator Kerry     Perfecting the science to treat these wounds means nothing without the planning and resources to get care to our soldiers at home   The military and veterans healthcare system must be capable of diagnosing  treating and providing rehabilitative services for those that need it most          It is important that we fully understand the extent to which eye injuries are being experienced by our men and women in uniform   Only then can we ensure that we are providing the necessary resources to help address the needs of our veterans     said Senator Pete Domenici  The text of the letter is below  The Honorable S  Ward Casscells  M D   Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs   1200 Defense Pentagon   Washington DC 20301 1200 Dear Dr  Casscells   We write to request information regarding the prevalence of eye injuries sustained by U S  military personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   According to the President   s Commission on Care for America   s Returning Wounded Warriors  48 cases of blinded service members have been reported  The Veterans Benefits Administration is currently providing service connection disability for 230 OIF and OEF veterans who have been discharged with some vision injuries  And still other estimates show that the number of vision related complications exceeds 1 000     especially when the vision impairment resulting from Traumatic Brain Injuries is taken into account    Based on the information available to us  we have concerns about not only the lack of comprehensive data with respect to eye injuries  but the accuracy of these numbers   In our continuing efforts to provide the best available care for our wounded warriors  it is imperative that we have an accurate system of accounting for these eye injuries  If we do not understand the magnitude of the problem  it is impossible to properly plan for and invest in adequate treatment  It is for this reason that we respectfully request the following information for the period October 1  2002 through September 2007  broken down by quarter    The total number of eye injuries  force wide  sustained in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  including the total number of such injuries that resulted in a medical evacuation from theater   The Department   s estimate of the total number of eye injuries sustained in combat but that did not result in a medical evacuation from theater   The number of cases of Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBI   s  that also contained a diagnosis of a vision impairment or other vision dysfunction due to TBI injury   The number of eye injuries that required eye surgery in Army  Navy  or Air Force medical facilities  and  The number of blinded service members referred for either outpatient or inpatient Department of Veterans Affairs Blind Rehabilitative Services or private agency rehabilitation   We know you would agree that our nation   s men and women in uniform deserve nothing but our best efforts in understanding  diagnosis and treating these eye injuries  Thank you for your attention to our request  We look forward to receiving a response with this information by November 16  2007   Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator John Kerry  United States Senator

718,August 10  2006 Senator Clinton Calls on VA Secretary to Affirm Commitment to Manhattan and Brooklyn VA Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In preparation for a possible announcement tomorrow on the future of the New York VA Hospitals  Senator calls again on VA Secretary Nicholson to keep the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA facilities open                                                                                                                                                                                                              New York  NY    On the eve of a possible announcement by U S  Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson in New York tomorrow  Senator Clinton reiterated her call for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA Hospitals to remain open  In a letter to Secretary Nicholson  Senator Clinton said she had been informed that he may be making an announcement about the hospitals   future on Friday in New York City and urged the Secretary to use it as an opportunity to affirm his commitment to both facilities            The Secretary  s announcement would seem like the perfect opportunity to affirm his commitment to keeping both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA Hospitals open  I urge the Secretary to tell local veterans in New York that their hospitals will remain open and that they can continue to get the healthcare services they need and deserve     Senator Clinton said           A copy of Senator  s letter to Secretary Nicholson is below          August 10  2006      The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20420      Dear Mr  Secretary       My office has been informed that you will be visiting the Manhattan Veterans Administration  VA  hospital on Friday   I urge you to use this visit as an opportunity to affirm that both the Manhattan VA and the Brooklyn VA hospitals should remain open          As you know  I have previously raised serious concerns regarding the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study further changes in New York  s VA facilities  including the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals   In April 2005  shortly after your confirmation as VA Secretary  I met with you and handed you a letter outlining these concerns            At various hearings of the Local Advisory Panel of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project  I have submitted testimony opposing the closure of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals   As I have noted  any decision regarding the future of the Manhattan VA hospital must take into account the unique relationship between the New York University School of Medicine and the Manhattan VA hospital   The partnership between the institutions has made the Manhattan VA hospital a model of high quality care  with six tertiary care specialties designated by the VA as centers of excellence   As you know  this hospital is also the home for the VISN 3 Interventional Cardiology  Cardiac Surgery and Neurosurgery Referral Centers   Closure of the Manhattan VA would not only imperil the relationship with NYU  but would also leave the approximately 185 000 veterans serviced in VISN 3 without ready access to those specialized programs          Likewise  the Brooklyn VA has multiple bed services and provides specialized cancer care   The Brooklyn VA maintains an affiliation with the SUNY Downstate Medical School   Just as the relationship between the Manhattan VA and the New York University School of Medicine would be imperiled by closure of the Manhattan VA  closure of the Brooklyn VA would threaten the existing SUNY relationship with the VA to the detriment of New York  s veterans           You should also take into account the practical matter of transportation when you consider the future of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals   The high quality services at the Manhattan VA hospital attract veterans from the City of New York as well as surrounding areas and other states   One of the main reasons that the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located in the heart of Manhattan at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere in the world   Similarly  a number of SUNY Downstate department chairs have pointed out that the Brooklyn VA is accessible to motor vehicles by virtue of its proximity in Brooklyn to the Belt Parkway and the Verrazano Bridge           At this time in our nation  s history  with United States troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation   Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement changes that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care          Given the strong arguments for keeping both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals open  I hope you will use Friday  s visit to the Manhattan VA to affirm your commitment to keeping both facilities open          Please do not hesitate to contact me or my staff if you have any questions  Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0

Lieberman and Evan Bayh  joined by parents  advocates and experts  introduced legislation designed to prohibit the sale of inappropriate video games to children   In unveiling the bill  the Senators underscored that video game content is getting increasingly violent and sexually explicit  yet young people are able to purchase these games with relative ease and parents are struggling to keep up with being informed about the content   The Senators emphasized that their legislation will put teeth in the enforcement of video game ratings  helping parents protect their children from inappropriate content   They were joined in making the announcement by April DeLaney  Director of the Washington Office for Common Sense Media  Norman Rosenberg  President and CEO of Parents Action for Children and Dr  Michael Rich  Director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children s Hospital in Boston and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School  in a show of support for the legislation            The holiday season is a particularly important time to raise awareness of this issue   Video games are hot holiday items  and there are certainly wonderful games that help our children learn and increase hand and eye coordination  However  there are also games that are just not appropriate for our nation  s youth     said Senator Clinton     This bill will help empower parents by making sure their kids can  t walk into a store and buy a video game that has graphic  violent and pornographic content              The content of many cutting edge games is becoming more and more vivid  violent  and offensive to our most basic values   Lieberman said    We are not interested in censoring videos meant for adult entertainment but we do want to ensure that these videos are not purchased by minors  Our bill will help accomplish this by imposing fines on those retailers that sell M rated games to minors  putting purchasing power back in the hands of watchful parents             Many parents are being stretched thin trying to provide a good life for their children while protecting them from a coarsening culture     Senator Bayh said     Our legislation will give parents a hand by requiring retailers to abide by the ratings that are meant to keep children from purchasing violent video games             The Clinton Lieberman Bayh bill  the Family Entertainment Protection Act  prohibits any business from selling or renting a Mature  Adults Only  or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen  On site store managers would be subject to a fine of  1 000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense   5 000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense   The bill also requires an annual  independent analysis of game ratings and requires the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to conduct an investigation to determine whether hidden content like in Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas is a pervasive problem and take appropriate action   In addition  the bill will help ensure that consumers have a mechanism to file complaints with the FTC and that the FTC will report these complaints to Congress   Finally  the bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual  random audit of retailers to monitor enforcement and report the findings to Congress           Senator Clinton was motivated to take action on this issue when it was revealed in July that Rockstar Games had embedded illicit sexual content in the video game Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas   This game had received a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB   which was unaware of the embedded content   When the content was revealed  Senator Clinton called on the FTC to investigate the source of the content and announced that she would work to develop legislation to address this problem   Senator Lieberman wrote to Rockstar games asking them to come clean on whether the material was embedded in the game   Rockstar Games subsequently recalled the game           Representative Joe Baca  CA   who has introduced legislation in the House to improve the video game ratings system  praised Senator Clinton for her involvement in this issue     I applaud Senator Clinton for introducing this legislation  and I look forward to working with her to help parents protect their children from exposure to inappropriate and harmful images              Illinois  Michigan  and California have all passed state laws to prohibit the sale of violent video games to minors           The following is a summary of the Clinton Lieberman Bayh legislation      Summary of The Family Entertainment Protection Act  SENATORS CLINTON LIEBERMAN BAYH    Consider the following scenario  You have been captured by a demented film maker who drops you into a gang infested slum  While the gangs think they are hunting you  they don  t know the real plot  that you are hunting them  while the director records each act of murder on film  Since you are outnumbered and could easily be mobbed  you cannot just jump in and fight everyone  Rather  you must be silent and patient  tracking your prey so that you can strike from behind  You strangle a villain with a sharp wire  and a finely rendered mist of blood sprays from his severed carotid artery         First Person Account of Manhunt from Time Magazine  2003    Video game content is getting more and more violent and sexually explicit  yet young people are able to purchase these games with relative ease    In its 2005  10th Annual MediaWise Video and Computer Game Report Card  The National Institute on Media and the Family found that retailers were more lenient in their selling practices this year compared to last   Boys as young as nine were able to purchase Mature rated games 42 percent of the time   At the same time  a majority of parents are feeling increasingly victimized by a culture of violence that makes it difficult to protect their children against influences they find to be inappropriate   This bill would help empower parents by putting them back in the driver  s seat  It would ensure that children can  t buy games the video game industry itself has determined to be inappropriate for them       I   Prohibition on Selling Mature and Adults Only video games to minors    The centerpiece of this bill is a prohibition against any business for selling or renting a Mature  Adults Only  or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen  On site store managers would be subject to a fine of  1 000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense   5 000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense   This provision is not aimed at punishing retailers who act in good faith to enforce the Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB  system  That  s why retailers would have an affirmative defense if they were shown an identification they believed to be valid or have a system in place to display and enforce the ESRB system  Similar prohibitions have become law in the last several months in California  Michigan  and Illinois       II   Annual Analysis of the Ratings System    Since the bill relies on the video game industry to continue rating the appropriateness of games for minors  this bill requires an annual  independent analysis of game ratings   This analysis will help ensure that the ESRB ratings system accurately reflects the content in each game and that the ratings system does not change significantly over time       III   Authority for the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to Investigate Misleading Ratings    Part of the genesis of this bill was the revelation that the makers of Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas had included  through embedded code that was discovered and made accessible to the public  sexually explicit content inconsistent with the game  s Mature rating   This bill requires the FTC to conduct an investigation to determine whether what happened with GTA  San Andreas is a pervasive problem  It also includes a Sense of Congress that the Commission shall take appropriate action if it determines that there is a pervasive problem       IV  Authority to Register Complaints    This bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection  BCP  of the FTC to ensure that consumers can file complaints if they find content to be misleading or deceptive and requires the BCP to report on the number of such complaints to Congress        V   Annual Retailer Audit    This bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual  random audit of retailers    sometimes referred to as a secret shopper survey    to determine how easy it is for young people to purchase Mature and Adults Only video games and report the findings to Congress          ,0

1756,"SENS. CLINTON, LEAHY, SANDERS, SCHUMER HAIL PASSAGE OF KEY LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH HUDSON-FULTON-CHAMPLAIN COMMEMORATION COMMISSION
  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Charles Schumer (D-NY) hailed the passage of their legislation to establish the Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission and the Hudson-Fulton 400th Commemoration Commission. The Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission Act, which now has passed the Senate as part of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, will help coordinate educational, cultural and historical projects while cooperating and assisting the programs and activities conceived by New York and Vermont. The Commission will also be responsible for facilitating nation-wide and international celebration efforts. The House soon is expected to take its final action on the legislation. 
   ""Trailblazers and explorers have always been a unique part of the American experience, and have played key roles in the founding and expansion of our great country. Next year will mark the 400th anniversary of the groundbreaking voyages of Hudson and Champlain and 200th anniversary of Fulton's travels,"" said Senator Clinton. ""I am extremely proud that my colleagues have passed this legislation, which I introduced, to celebrate these pioneers and their historic achievements. New York has a proud legacy of leadership in innovation, exploration, and ingenuity, and this Commission will serve to help educate generations of Americans about the historical and cultural impact of Hudson, Champlain, and Fulton on our country's legacy and national identity.""
   ""For centuries Lake Champlain has helped unite and sustain the communities and the people of the expansive Champlain Valley,"" said Leahy, who noted that Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT) is a sponsor of counterpart legislation in the House. ""Lake Champlain is a defining feature of our landscape and our culture, and it is one of the nation's historic and environmental treasures. The quadricentennial is a milestone worthy of cataloguing and celebrating this rich history.""
   ""Lake Champlain has played a huge part in Vermont history,"" Sanders said. ""The 400th anniversary gives us the chance to celebrate the past and renew our commitment to protect the lake for future generations,"" Sanders said.
   ""This commission will ensure that generations of New Yorkers to come will remember the landmark journeys of Henry Hudson, Samuel de Champlain and Robert Fulton-pioneers who paved the way for New York's rich tradition of maritime innovation and discovery,"" said Schumer. ""It will also go a long way toward promoting and supporting tourism across the state as we prepare to celebrate these historic anniversaries next year.""
   2009 will mark the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Henry Hudson, the first European to sail up the Hudson River; the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Samuel de Champlain, the first European to explore Lake Champlain; and the 200th anniversary of the voyage of Robert Fulton, the first person to use steam navigation on a commercial basis.
   The Hudson and Fulton explorations led to the establishment of trading posts, military posts, and settlements as far south as Lake George. From these early establishments came trade, commerce, cultural, and religious impact deep into the Mohawk Valley and as far west as Lake Erie. These settlements influenced our Nation's history, culture, law, commerce, and traditions of liberty that extend to the present day.
   Almost 200 years later, in 1807, Robert Fulton navigated the Hudson River from the city of New York to Albany in the steamboat Clermont, successfully inaugurating steam navigation on a commercial basis. This event helped revolutionize waterborne commerce on the great rivers of the United States and fostered international relations through transoceanic travel and trade.

WASHINGTON   In the wake of reports that four no bid contracts for Gulf Coast reconstruction have ballooned from  400 million to  3 4 billion  U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  Monday sent a letter to Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  Director R  David Paulison asking him explain what efforts have been made to stop the use of no bid contracts  how these contracts were allowed to balloon  and what  if any  additional authority the agency needs to permanently stop these abuses     We cannot express to you in strong enough terms how serious this issue is to us and our Senate colleagues  On four separate occasions over the past year  the Senate has unanimously approved amendments to limit the use of non competitive procedures in contracting   the Senators wrote   Competition is good for American business  and it s good for the government  It helps to ensure high quality and low costs  Competition is what the American people have a right to expect  and that s what we intend to achieve     Obama and Coburn said that in both private meetings and public testimony  Director Paulison has expressed concerns about the use of no bid contracts and promised that FEMA would employ non competitive procedures rarely and only when absolutely necessary to avoid unacceptable disruption to critical services  But despite these repeated assurances  news reports indicate that no bid contracts are still being awarded  The four contractors who won no bid contracts to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees have seen the value of the contracts balloon from  400 million to about  3 4 billion  and these contractors were awarded another  1 billion in potential contracts last week from FEMA     Given your strong statements in opposition to no bid contracts  we were greatly troubled to learn that FEMA is continuing to extend these contracts to the point that their value is now more than eight times the original contract value   the Senators wrote   Since we are nearing the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  we question whether any emergency remains that would justify a continued reliance on no bid procedures     Below please find the full text of Obama and Coburn s letter       August 14  2006    The Honorable R  David Paulison  Director  Federal Emergency Management Agency  500 C Street S W   Washington  D C  20472 Dear Mr  Paulison  We are writing to express our grave concern about the contracting practices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  that were highlighted August 9th in the Washington Post   According to the Post  four no bid contracts awarded to house Hurricane Katrina evacuees have ballooned in value from  400 million to about  3 4 billion    In private meetings with us on December 15  2005 and May 17  2006  you expressed similar concerns about the use of no bid contracts and promised that FEMA would employ non competitive procedures rarely and only when absolutely necessary to avoid unacceptable disruption to critical services     You also have made similar public statements to our Senate colleagues   In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on October 6  2005  you stated  I ve been a public servant for a long time  and I ve never been a fan of no bid contracts   Sometimes you have to do them because of the expediency of getting things done   And I can assure that you we are going to look at all of those contracts very carefully   All of those no bid contracts  we are going to go back and re bid  Given your strong statements in opposition to no bid contracts  we were greatly troubled to learn that FEMA is continuing to extend these contracts to the point that their value is now more than eight times the original contract value   Since we are nearing the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina  we question whether any emergency remains that would justify a continued reliance on no bid procedures  Indeed  just last week  we learned that the four contractors   Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw   who received the original no bid contracts were awarded new contracts to provide temporary housing   Each of these new awards has a contract ceiling of  250 million   And while the congressional advisory announcing the awards indicates that these contracts were awarded  through a full and open process   concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the competitive process  We cannot express to you in strong enough terms how serious this issue is to us and our Senate colleagues   On four separate occasions over the past year  the Senate has unanimously approved amendments to limit the use of non competitive procedures in contracting  The American people deserve the benefits of competition in government contracts   Competition is good for American business  and it s good for the government   It helps to ensure high quality and low costs   Competition is what the American people have a right to expect  and that s what we intend to achieve   In order for us to assess whether additional Senate action is necessary  we request that you respond to the following questions by August 31  2006 What efforts  if any  have you made to stop the use of no bid procedures  What procedures were used for the latest  250 million contracts awarded to Bechtel  CH2M Hill  Fluor  and Shaw  What  if any  additional resources or authority do you need to stop the use of no bid procedures      Sincerely  Tom Coburn  M D   United States Senator Barack Obama

Army Captain and Iraq war veteran  today announced that they have introduced legislation in both chambers of Congress to enact a new GI Bill for the 21st Century   The new legislation  the 21st Century GI Bill of Rights Act of 2007  will expand educational  housing and entrepreneurial opportunities for soldiers  veterans and their families   Senator Clinton and Representative Murphy were joined in announcing the bill by Captain Mike Smith  Retired  USN   President  Reserve Officers Association  Dennis Cullinan  Director Legislative Affairs  Veterans of Foreign Wars  Joe Washam  Chief Liaison of Government Affairs  Salute America s Heroes  Pat Combs  National President  National Association of Realtors  and Dr  Robert A  Scott  President  Adelphi University  who attended college as a recipient of the original GI Bill   They were also joined by representatives of many of the organizations endorsing the bill  including the Military Officers Association of America  National Military Families Association  AmVets  and the National Center for Women   Information Technology              The GI Bill has helped millions of soldiers transition successfully to civilian life and it has been one of the best investments we have made as a nation   Now it is time to update and modernize the GI Bill for the 21st century to meet the needs of today s soldiers  veterans and their families  from education to housing and microloans to start a small business   This is the right way to invest in the future of our servicemembers and reward the service they have given to our country   said Senator Clinton           With a new generation of veterans putting their lives on their line  it s time for us to honor their commitment and sacrifice   said Congressman Murphy    Thanks to the original GI Bill  countless veterans earned a good education  bought a home or started a business   As a soldier who deployed twice since 9 11  I am proud to help the next generation live that same American dream           The 21st Century GI Bill of Rights Act of 2007 will guarantee eligibility to all servicemembers    Active Duty  National Guard  and Reserves    who have served since September 11  2001 and deployed overseas in support of a combat operation   Eligibility will also be extended to Active Duty personnel who have served a minimum of two years on Active Duty since September 11  2001  and National Guard and Reserve personnel who have served a minimum aggregate of two years on Active Duty since September 11  2001             The Clinton Murphy bill will               Increase Education Opportunities   The act will fund undergraduate education for servicemembers   eight college semesters of tuition  fees  books  room and board  and other educational costs  commensurate with costs paid by non veterans    The education grant also can be used for specialized trade or technical training  and certification and licensing programs for both veterans and disabled veterans  Participants will not be required to pay into the program to receive grants                Increase Veterans Housing Opportunities   The act will exempt Veterans from paying loan fees and expand opportunities for veterans to purchase  build  repair or improve a home by increasing access to low interest loans through the Veterans Affairs Home Loan Guaranty Loan Program for homes valued up to  625 000   The current program requires loan fees and is capped at the conforming loan rate of  417 000                Increase Veterans Entrepreneurial Opportunities   The Clinton Murphy bill would establish a Veterans Microloan Program  administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Small Business Administration   The program would provide Veterans microloans for entrepreneurial ventures up to  100 000 with interest rates capped at 2 5 percent and without requiring collateral   The program would also direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide Veterans counseling  technical assistance  and community outreach assistance              With these enhanced benefits  today s veterans can become an army of college graduates prepared for careers in the critical need areas of science  technology  engineering  education  and health care  As a beneficiary of the Vietnam Era G I  Bill  and president of a University that welcomed hundreds of G I  s to its campus post World War II  I have seen first hand how federal investments can generate enormous and profound returns  By renewing our commitment to the intent of the Servicemembers  Readjustment Act  we can invest in America s future  and express our thanks to those who have served us well   Our economy  our schools  our healthcare system  our businesses  and our communities will benefit   said Adelphi University President Robert A  Scott           The Coalition to Salute America s Heroes is proud to support the 21st Century Bill of Rights that is being introduced by both Senator

                       Obama Calls on Labor Department to Prevent Minimum Wage and Overtime Violations Friday  July 25  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Recent GAO reports conclude Labor Department enforcement inadequate WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao  expressing concerns that the Department of Labor is not fulfilling its mission to prevent and remedy violations of federal minimum wage and overtime laws   As cited in a recent editorial in the New York Times  two Government Accountability Office  GAO  reports noted serious problems at the Wage and Hour Division  WHD  of the Labor Department   One report concluded that WHD is not adequately assuring employer compliance   Another report  found an alarming lapse in the Department s handling of individual worker complaints   Despite GAO s conclusions  Acting Administrator of WHD Alexander Passantino  whose nomination is pending in the Senate  testified before the House Education and Labor Committee that GAO was categorically wrong in all of its major findings    In the letter  Obama asks Secretary Chao about Mr  Passantino s categorical rejection of GAO s findings and recommendations and how she will remedy the problems raised    The text of the letter is below    Dear Madame Secretary   I am writing to express serious concerns regarding recent reports that the U S  Department of Labor is not fulfilling its mission to prevent and remedy violations of federal minimum wage and overtime laws   It is important that the Department put procedures into place that will lead to improvements in the enforcement of workers  rights   This is the core mission of the Department and failing to adequately enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act  FLSA  is unacceptable   Most recently  two Government Accountability Office  GAO  reports shed light on serious problems at the Wage and Hour Division  WHD    One report addressed the overall effectiveness of the Division s enforcement procedures  finding that WHD is not adequately assuring employer compliance   It found that the WHD did not effectively take advantage of available information and tools in planning and conducting its compliance activities  failed to use key data on complaints and input from external groups   such as employer and worker advocacy organizations   to inform its planning process   This report also found that WHD focused on the same four industries from 1997 to 2007  despite information from its own commissioned studies that there were other low wage industries that had equally high rates of potential wage and hour violations   Finally  the GAO concluded that the agency does not sufficiently leverage its existing tools and partnerships to encourage employers to comply with the law  Another GAO report found alarming lapses in the Department s handling of individual worker complaints   GAO found frequent instances where WHD   1  inappropriately rejected complaints based on incorrect information provided by employers   2  failed to make adequate attempts to locate employers   3  did not thoroughly investigate and resolve complaints  and  4  delayed initiating investigations for excessive periods of time     Last week  Acting Administrator of WHD Alexander Passantino  whose nomination is pending in the Senate  testified before the House Education and Labor Committee that GAO was categorically wrong in all of its major findings   I would like to know whether you agree with Mr  Passantino s categorical rejection of GAO s findings and recommendations    If so  I would appreciate a detailed response explaining the basis on which you have rejected the conclusions of GAO  an independent agency whose mission is to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government for the benefit of the American people    If in fact you disagree with Mr  Passantino  I would like you to explain specifically what steps you plan to take to address the shortcomings in the process that the report raises   GAO s conclusions about how the Department exercises its responsibilities to working Americans raise serious  but addressable  issues   Fixing these problems may require bipartisan cooperation  or in some cases additional funding  but other needed reforms are in the sole discretion of the Department  and can be instituted unilaterally     I understand that the Congressional committees of jurisdiction will be sending the Department detailed questions in conjunction with both the House hearing and Mr  Passantino s nomination   I look forward to your responses to those questions  as well as to this communication   I further hope that you will direct the Acting Administrator to revisit his recent statement and commit to reforming the Wage and Hour Division for the benefit all workers   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period

120,   Bayh  Obama Introduce Legislation To Reduce Barriers to Responsible Fatherhood   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Bayh  Obama Introduce Legislation To Reduce Barriers to Responsible Fatherhood Friday  June 15  2007  For Immediate Release  Contact  Eric Kleiman  Bayh  or Ben LaBolt  Obama    Senators say men must take responsibility for raising their children   Washington  D C      U S  Senators Evan Bayh  D IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation to encourage more men to take responsibility for their children and to address the challenges faced by millions of American families as a result of the national epidemic of absentee fathers   In the last 40 years  the number of children without fathers in America has more than quadrupled  from 5 million in 1960 to more than 24 million today  An estimated 40 percent of the children who live in fatherless households have not seen their fathers in at least one year  Studies show that children without fathers in their lives are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime  nine times more likely to drop out of school  and 20 times more likely to end up in prison  They also are more likely to have behavioral problems  to run away from home  and to become teenage parents themselves   The Responsible Fatherhood and Healthy Families Act of 2007 removes government penalties on married families and offers support for fathers trying to do the right thing while cracking down on men who avoid their parental responsibilities  The bill would provide fathers with innovative job training services and other economic opportunities  while expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to help non custodial parents trying to support their families  It would also increase child support enforcement by helping governments collect a projected  13 billion in payments from those who don   t fulfill their parental responsibilities   The Bayh Obama legislation would help ensure that money paid for child support goes directly to children and their mothers and does not result in loss of food assistance for eligible families  It would also strengthen domestic violence prevention services       Conceiving a child doesn   t make you a man  but raising one responsibly does     Bayh said     Fatherlessness is an issue many politicians would prefer to avoid  but elected officials have a moral obligation not to sit idly by while communities crumble because of the epidemic of absentee fathers  I am not na  ve enough to believe that government alone can solve this problem  but together we can play a constructive role in crafting policies that attack the root causes of this epidemic  Fatherless children are more likely to do poorly in school and have emotional and behavioral problems  They are more likely to commit crimes  smoke cigarettes  and abuse drugs and alcohol  Many of our most pressing societal ills can be addressed by tackling the fatherhood crisis effectively          As fathers  we need to teach our boys what makes you a man is not just having a child  it   s having the courage to raise a child     Obama said     Congress can make it easier for those who make that responsible choice   and make it harder for those who avoid it  This legislation will provide support for fathers who are trying to do the right thing in making child support payments by providing them with job training and job opportunities and expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit  It stops penalizing marriage in the tax code and makes sure that children and families  not the government  receive every penny of child support  It would also crack down on those who avoid their responsibility by increasing child support enforcement  a measure that will collect nearly  13 billion in payments that can help raise  nurture  and educate children      In the U S  House of Representatives  companion legislation is being introduced by Congresswoman Julia Carson  D IN  and Congressman Danny Davis  D IL        This is good legislation for families across Indiana and America     Carson said     It sends a message to our men that  once you become a parent  you have a responsibility to that child and we   re going to hold you accountable  but we   re also going to provide you the tools for success   The role a father plays in the life of a child is invaluable  and it   s heartbreaking to consider that almost 25 million kids in this country grow up without a father in their lives   This legislation will take steps toward changing that          This bill is a key component of a fresh approach to family support  one which supports and strengthens families before they are at risk     Davis said     This legislation provides the tools to strengthen relationships between fathers and their children and encourages fathers to become good nurturers and providers  The fullest positive participation by fathers helps to create a caring environment capable of fostering optimal child development  promotes humanistic cultural and community traditions while reducing poverty  teenage pregnancies  juvenile delinquency and incidents of child abuse and neglect  In the process of assuming responsibility for fatherhood  fathers themselves acquire new self confidence  new parenting skills  higher educational accomplishments and greater economic independence      Last year  Congress passed legislation based on a proposal introduced by Senator Bayh that provided up to  50 million each year for the next five years in funding for responsible fatherhood programs nationwide as part of the spending reconciliation bill

1765,"SEN. SANDERS CALLS BORDER CROSSING DELAYS 'UNACCEPTABLE,' INVITES HOMELAND SECURITY CHIEF TO VERMONT-QUEBEC BORDER
  Citing ""deep concerns"" about long delays crossing the border separating the United States and Canada, Senator Bernie Sanders urged Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to ""come to Vermont and take action to put an end to this absolutely unacceptable situation.""  
   The senator also established a committee of Vermont state and local officials, law enforcement authorities, business owners and others affected by increasing border crossing problems. 
   In a letter to the Homeland Security Department secretary, Sanders cited inexcusable delays of up to three hours at some vehicle checkpoints. 
   ""While we all agree that we must secure our borders, we also need to ensure that we have in place a procedure that allows for the timely and efficient processing of customs and immigration checks,"" Sanders wrote to Chertoff. ""The current situation is simply unacceptable.""
   Part of the problem, the senator added, is that at major Vermont border checkpoints some traffic lanes are closed due to a serious shortage of border patrol agents. ""The resulting back up of vehicles and people has a profound effect on commerce and tourism, in addition to other economic repercussions,"" Sanders told Chertoff. 
   Border crossing problems were discussed last week at town meetings Sanders hosted in Lyndon and St. Albans, two of several Vermont Listening Sessions held throughout the state. ""We have a border crossing crisis that could unhinge the Vermont economy and it's coming at us very fast,"" Bill Stenger, president of Jay Peak Resort told the senator. 
   Sanders also was contacted by a citizens committee made up of residents from the border community of Derby Line, Vt., and Stanstead, Quebec. In addition to long waits to cross the border, the letter said, ""Residents from both sides of the line are being alienated and are made to feel like criminals."" 
   The committee described ""an intolerable situation"" that it said ""is killing business on both sides of the line."" For example, what used to be a 15-minute trip to a grocery store in Stanstead now takes an hour or more. Drivers endure lines lasting half an hour or more for what used to be a two-minute trip from the Canadian town to a gas station in Derby Line.

757,May 10  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Sweeping Legislation to Fix Major Problems Facing Wounded Servicemembers Transitioning from DoD to VA Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Continuing her efforts to address problems facing wounded servicemen and women  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced new legislation to bridge the gap between healthcare provided by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs   Senator Clinton s bill  the Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act  provides a comprehensive solution to these transition issues and ensures a continuum of care for severely injured servicemembers              The Department of Defense  DoD  has failed to meet the medical needs of this generation s wounded warriors as they transition from the Armed Services to civilian life   Effective collaboration and coordination between the DoD and VA healthcare systems is critical for supporting an all volunteer force and meeting the needs of this generation s wounded warriors   said Senator Clinton          The mistreatment of servicemembers at Walter Reed and testimony from recent hearings in both the Senate Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees have revealed major gaps affecting servicemembers  including discrepancies in benefits for active duty and medically retired servicemembers  difficulties in obtaining needed care for wounded servicemembers transitioning from the Armed Services to civilian life  and disparities between the DoD and VA disability rating systems          To address these issues and improve oversight to prevent future problems  Senator Clinton s bill               Establishes a two year blanket overlap of active duty and veterans health services and benefits for all severely injured servicemembers to facilitate their recovery and help resolve administrative problems like those found at Walter Reed   All costs of health care services and benefits  for both active duty and medically retired servicemembers  will be paid for by the DoD  Those injured on or after October 7  2001 would be covered  but eligibility will not include retroactive compensation for payments already made               Creates a joint DoD VA Office of Transition for the coordination of assistance to members of the Armed Forces in their transition from service in the Armed Forces to civilian life    The Secretaries of DOD and VA would have oversight of the Office of Transition and the office would also be required to submit mandatory annual reports and biannual briefings to Congress  The GAO would also submit a biennial report on the Office of Transition s activities               Reforms the current disability rating system to ensure that there is continuity of medical care and no disruption in compensation payments made to wounded servicemembers   DoD would no longer assign the actual disability rating  but would still determine fitness for duty and document such a decision in writing  while VA would assign final ratings for all service connected injuries  Further  the legislation would revoke a requirement in current law that requires the delay in payment of VA benefits  making them available to eligible recipients immediately                Requires GAO investigation of DoD and VA coordination on medical treatment   The GAO will submit a preliminary assessment and final report on the extent to which medical facilities of the DoD and VA offer interdisciplinary medical treatment for wounded members of the Armed Forces            This legislation builds on a measure introduced by Senator Clinton  along with Senator Evan Bayh  D IN   to provide a temporary fix to these transition problems by extending active duty status for one year for severely wounded soldiers   Senator Clinton s bill introduced today will provide a long term solution to this challenge   The Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act is endorsed by the Wounded Warrior Project  the Military Officers Association of America  and the National Military Family Association             The provisions in this legislation will help insure a smoother transition from military service for our nation s wounded warriors   said John Melia  Wounded Warrior Project Executive Director   It will streamline the retirement process for the severely injured and will provide these brave men and women with access to the comprehensive benefits of both the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs            The Military Officers Association of America strongly supports the Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act   This legislation addresses three key elements to improve seamless transition between DoD and VA personnel and health systems   It is designed to ensure a continuum of health care  a DoD and VA team working together everyday to craft solutions  and a disability rating system that will guarantee fair and consistent long term compensation benefits for wounded servicemembers   We applaud Senator Clinton s foresight and understanding of the complex problems faced and the solutions needed   said Colonel Ana Smythe  Retired   Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Military Officers Association of America  MOAA             As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need   She has introduced a new legislative initiative to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families   Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits   She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform   She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing  recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need   She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning veterans          ,0

514,   Obama  Coburn Hurricane Katrina Oversight Bill Passes Senate Committee Unanimously   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Coburn Hurricane Katrina Oversight Bill Passes Senate Committee Unanimously Thursday  September 22  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 22  2005 Obama  Coburn Hurricane Katrina Oversight Bill Passes Senate Committee Unanimously Obama Says Unanimous Committee Passage is First Step to Ensuring Financial Accountability   WASHINGTON   Legislation introduced by U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  designed to ensure financial integrity in the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort passed the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs today by unanimous voice vote  Unanimous committee passage is a crucial first step in ensuring that the Oversight of Vital Emergency Recovery Spending Enhancement and Enforcement Act  OVERSEE  becomes law    Recently  Congress approved  62 billion for Gulf Coast relief and rebuilding efforts   most of which will go directly to FEMA   said Obama   This is twelve times the amount of money FEMA was given last year   more than it has ever been trusted to spend before  If FEMA s track record during the rescue effort and in years before is any indication of how they will perform during the rebuilding that lies ahead  this should concern every taxpayer and every citizen interested in helping the millions of Americans who have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina     Previous rebuilding efforts involving FEMA and other government agencies have a history of fraud  corruption  and waste when there is no oversight or accountability in how the funds are spent  Following Hurricane Frances in 2004  FEMA awarded  30 million and approved more than 12 000 claims for residents of Miami Dade County  The storm  however  made landfall 100 miles north and Miami Dade never even saw hurricane force winds    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    As we look towards the massive Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts ahead  we must demand accountability over how the billions of dollars we ve given to FEMA are spent   said Obama   The CFO will also specifically look at whether federal funds are going to people most in need  whether federal funds are going to companies that hire local workers  and the extent to which the federal government is using no bid and  cost plus  contracts  As you ll recall  these contracts are what caused the whole contracting mess in Iraq     Even if the levees hadn t burst and New Orleans didn t flood  Hurricane Katrina would still be the largest natural disaster this country has ever faced  and the rebuilding effort will be certainly be the largest and costliest of its kind  This entrusts FEMA with a massive amount of responsibility  and so it s only right that we protect both taxpayers and citizens on the Gulf Coast with strict accountability and oversight about how the money is being spent and whether it s being most efficiently directed to helping people rebuild their lives  I believe the bill s unanimous passage by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs shows our commitment to financial accountability in these rebuilding efforts  and is an important first step in creating a CFO who will help ensure our tax dollars aren t wasted    SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT   A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina  Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse  The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President  The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers                                    ,1
1909,"REACHING OUT TO VETERANS
  ""Retired Vermont National Guard Sgt. 1st Class Michael Currier heads out looking for service members who are having trouble readjusting to civilian life. Some days, he meets with members of the clergy, soldiers' wives, parents, employers, sometimes the police. And of course, he meets with the soldiers themselves. Based in Springfield, he's looking for soldiers having trouble resuming a routine after having spent time in Iraq or Afghanistan,"" began an Associated Press article on a first-of-its-kind veterans outreach program in Vermont. Now, the Vermont program could become a model for the nation.  
   ""My hope is that increased coordination between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs and local and state organizations will mean that veterans and their families will be better informed and more likely to get the care they deserve,' said Senator Bernie Sanders.
   The Senate on Monday passed a Department of Defense bill that would authorize a national pilot project, modeled after the Vermont program.
   In a floor statement on Tuesday, the senator said the pilot program would deal with ""a very important problem, and that problem is that all across our country, men and women are returning home from the war in Iraq, from the war in Afghanistan, and they're coming home to big cities, small towns, and rural communities. They, and they and their families, in many case cases, are hurting. 
   ""These are soldiers and military family members who are suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, who are suffering with traumatic brain injury, who are suffering from depression, who are watching their marriages and their families coming apart. They know that they are suffering nightmares, they're suffering panic attacks, sometimes uncontrollable anger and various physical symptoms. Because of the stigma, many of these brave soldiers do not come forward for help. Others, where the military infrastructure is not strong, simply don't know where to turn. They and their families, in many cases, are hurting.""
   ""In my view, we have a moral responsibility to reach out to these soldiers and their families and to help them,"" Sanders said.
