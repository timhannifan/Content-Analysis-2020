1144,September 14  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Consideration of the Katrina Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC     Four years ago this week  our nation was grappling with the catastrophic aftermath of the attacks on 9 11   What happened on that tragic day changed my state of New York  our nation  s capital and our country forever          Over the past two weeks  we have come to a similar realization about Hurricane Katrina   The Hurricane left in its path not just death and devastation  but a deep  lasting scar   And while we must now work to do everything we can to help the victims of this national tragedy  we must also do everything we can to make sure that the mistakes that were made never happen again          I called for an independent Katrina Commission because it is simply not appropriate for government to investigate itself   If we are truly going to provide the people in the Gulf    and all Americans    with the answers they deserve  we need an independent commission free of partisan politics   It is also important that Congress not be distracted from the task at hand    making sure that our fellow citizens get all the help they need as they recover and rebuild          What happened today on the Senate floor is the same thing that happened four years ago when our nation was desperately searching for answers after 9 11   Urgent calls for an independent commission were repeatedly ignored  but the American people did not fall silent   They continued to demand action and eventually the Administration relinquished its opposition to the 9 11 Commission   And our nation was well served by the Commission  s work          On behalf of the people of the Gulf who I visited with last week in Houston  and all Americans who are demanding answers  I will continue to fight for the creation of the Katrina Commission   I firmly believe that we need to look back to see what went wrong so we can move forward and do better   Only through an independent Katrina Commission will we be able to know that no storm or no act of terrorism will ever again leave us so unable to respond                 ,0
1968,"DARK SIDE OF CHOCOLATE
  A delegation of American lawmakers is visiting cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast and Ghana this week to monitor child labor abuses. Senator Bernie Sanders said before departing for Africa that he hoped ""to see to what degree indentured children are being used to manufacture products which come into this country as chocolate."" One 2005 study said as many as 200,000 children worked in plantations in the Ivory Coast, according an Agence France-Presse report. ""The issue of child labor and the fact that you have very young kids who are working horrendous hours and not going to schools is an international problem,"" Sanders told the Burlington weekly newspaper Seven Days, ""and it's one that has concerned me for a number of years. So we'll take a look and see what's going on in the chocolate industry."" 
   While most of the major cocoa exporters - Cargill; Archer, Daniels, Midland & Nestle - and manufacturers - Mars and Hershey's - haven't certified any of their cocoa as child-labor free, a third-party, independent monitoring group called TransFair USA has been able to certify that approximately 16,000 cocoa farms in Ghana and the Ivory Coast were free of the worst forms of child labor through the ""Fair Trade Chocolate"" movement. Through a certification process, cocoa farmers are guaranteed a living wage, farmers agree not to use indentured labor, and farms are organized into democratic cooperatives. Unfortunately, none of the major cocoa exporters, producers, or manufacturers has agreed to participate in the Fair Trade Chocolate movement, so less than 1 percent of the chocolate consumed in the world is Fair Trade Chocolate.

1933,"SENATE BACKS DRUG IMPORTATION
  The Senate voted 63 to 28 to advance an amendment cosponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders to allow importation of safe, FDA-approved prescription drugs from Canada and other countries. ""The unfortunate reality is that Americans continue to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Because of the escalating cost of medicines, many people do not get their prescriptions filled. Many people remain ill, and some die. That's just not right. It's time for Congress to act decisively to make sure every person in this country can afford the life-saving medicines that he or she needs at a price that is affordable,"" Sanders said.
   The vote in the Senate on Thursday showed there is more than enough support to attach the provision to the Food and Drug Administration overhaul bill the Senate is debating this week. 
   Said Sanders: ""The very simple question is: why do Americans have to pay the highest prices in the world for their medicine? Why, when we import huge quantities of food products from Latin America, China and all around the world, can we not import FDA approved medicine from a small number of drug companies in the most industrialized countries on earth. The answer is that we can and we must.
   ""In many ways, the American people are now giving up on their own government in this area - and are taking matters into their own hands. Several years ago there was an estimate that two million Americans were going across the Canadian border to purchase safe and affordable medicine. The American people want action on this issue, they want us to lower the cost of prescription drugs in this country, and today is the day for us to do that by passing prescription drug re-importation and the Dorgan amendment.
   ""Clearly, the drug companies have been fighting back hard. According to a January 12, 2007, Washington Post article, they have spent some $900 million in lobbying between 1998 and 2005. It has reported that they have on their payroll over 1200 well paid lobbyists - including former leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties. And from 1990 to 2006, they made over $139 million in campaign contributions.
   ""And it is not like the Drug Companies are hurting. According to Fortune Magazine, the top 19 pharmaceutical companies in 2005 made $42.1 billion in profits. In 2004 their profit margin was almost 16 percent, 3 times higher than the average of Fortune 500 companies.
   USA Today reported that Sanders ""spoke in pointed terms about what he described as the ""enormous"" power of the drug companies over Congress. He noted figures showing that since 1998, the pharmaceutical industry has spent more than $900 million on federal lobbying. The 1,200 registered prescription-drug lobbyists ""descend like locusts into the offices of members of Congress and say, 'Don't vote for change. Keep the status quo alive. Make sure that the American people continue to pay the highest prices for medicine in the entire world,' "" Sanders said.
   The American Chronicle wrote that after Sanders delivered his speech, a"" visibly emotional Senator Robert Byrd stood to say, ""Thank God for Bernie Sanders, the Senator from Vermont. Thank God."" That was all he said - it was all he had to say. The reason for his remark was the speech Senator Sanders had just delivered. In a scathing rebuke of the nine-year congressional deference to the pharmaceutical industry, Senator Sanders told the nation what has been going on during that time. What had happened was that the kind of remarks that are normally only heard in homes and gathering places across the country had been said by a Senator - on the floor of the Senate - in front of a camera.""

                                  Obama Applauds EPA s Commitment to Write Long Delayed Laws to Protect Kids from Lead Paint Monday  July 25  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  July 25  2005  Obama Applauds EPA s Commitment to Write Long Delayed Laws to Protect Kids from Lead Paint   WASHINGTON   In a letter to U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  Administrator Stephen L  Johnson  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Monday said that he is pleased by EPA s commitment to write long delayed regulations to protect children from dangerous lead paint exposure    Renovation and repair of older residences is the principal source of lead paint exposure to U S  children  According to federal studies  a large majority of the approximately 20 30 million renovations done on older homes each year are done without lead safe cleanup and contamination practices  Over 430 000 children in America have dangerously high levels of lead in their blood    In 1992  Congress required the EPA to write regulations relating to the dispersal of lead paint by contractors during home remodeling by October  1996  As of July 2005  these regulations still have not been written  In April  Administrator Johnson stated that to address the problem of lead paint poisoning  the EPA  will determine what additional steps may be necessary  including regulation  despite the fact that the 1992 law does not say the regulations are optional    When asked about the status of these regulations before the EPW Committee two weeks ago  Deputy Administrator designate Marcus Peacock stated    As I understand it  the Agency will announce by the end of this year a comprehensive program  which will include a proposed regulation  as well as an extensive education and outreach campaign aimed at the renovation  repair  and painting industry and the consumer     Obama also received a letter from Susan Hazen  Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator  which said   the Agency plans to announce by the end of this year  a comprehensive program that will include a proposed rule     In light of commitments I have received from Mr  Peacock and Ms  Hazen  I voted last Wednesday to confirm Mr  Peacock for the deputy administrator position   Obama wrote   However  I want you to know that I will be closely monitoring EPA s actions regarding lead paint and will expect proposed rules to be issued by December 31  2005     Full text of the letter below     July 25  2005   The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  401 M Street  SW  Washington  DC  20460   Dear Administrator Johnson    As you may know  I have been concerned about the failure of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to promulgate regulations pursuant to 15 U S C  S2682 c  3    This provision requires EPA to issue rules for contractors to reduce lead exposure during home renovation and remodeling by October 1996   Almost nine years later  these rules still have not been issued  and I have spent the past few months trying to understand why    When your nomination was considered by the Senate Environment and Public Works  EPW  Committee in April  I asked you when EPA was going to issue these rules   You stated that EPA was focusing on a voluntary education and outreach program and  will evaluate the effectiveness of this effort and will determine what additional steps may be necessary  including regulation    Of course  15 U S C  S2682 c  3  does not give EPA the option of whether to promulgate regulations     In May  Sen  Boxer  Rep  Waxman  and I wrote a follow up letter to you  asking once again when EPA would issue these rules on lead   We received no response for two months    In June  I included an amendment in the EPA appropriations bill that would prohibit the agency from spending any funds to delay the implementation of 15 U S C  S2682 c  3    That bill passed the Senate unanimously    When Deputy Administrator designate Marcus Peacock appeared before the EPW Committee two weeks ago  I asked him about the status of these lead rules   Responding to written questions that I submitted to him after the hearing  Mr  Peacock stated    As I understand it  the Agency will announce by the end of this year a comprehensive program  which will include a proposed regulation  as well as an extensive education and outreach campaign aimed at the renovation  repair  and painting industry and the consumer     I am pleased by Mr  Peacock s statement  which is a significant departure from your response in April   I am also encouraged by a letter I received last week from Susan Hazen  Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator  responding to my May letter   Ms  Hazen reiterated that  the Agency plans to announce by the end of this year  a comprehensive program that will include a proposed rule     In light of the commitments I received from Mr  Peacock and Ms  Hazen  I voted last Wednesday to confirm Mr  Peacock for the deputy administrator position   However  I want you to know that I will be closely monitoring EPA s actions regarding lead paint and will expect you to honor your commitment to issue these proposed rules by December 31  2005     I look forward to working with you on this important issue     Sincerely

522,   Obama Calls for the Expansion of Children   s Health Insurance   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls for the Expansion of Children   s Health Insurance Tuesday  July 31  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today spoke on the Senate floor to call for the expansion of the Children   s Health Insurance Program  CHIP    As more Americans lose their health insurance everyday  CHIP has provided 6 million uninsured children with the health care they need  and encouraged states like Illinois to build on its success and expand health coverage even further   The reauthorization bill before the Senate would expand coverage to reach an additional 3 2 million children  Obama   s remarks  as prepared for delivery  are below     As I   ve traveled across this country over the last few years  there are fewer issues that show a greater disconnect between what the American people want and the way Washington works than health care          Every year people put it at the very top of their list of concerns   Every year more people lose their insurance  or watch their premiums skyrocket  or open up medical bills that they just can   t pay          And yet  whenever the issue actually comes up in Washington  they watch health care debates play out that are filled with half truths and scare tactics   They see insurance companies run ads telling folks they   ll lose their doctor or wait forever if universal health care is passed          They watch the industry spend billions on lobbyists who use undue influence to block much needed reform   And at the end of the day  nothing gets done  and we move on to fight about something else          To most Americans  we seem completely disconnected from the reality that they   re living every day   Especially when we have a President who actually said     I mean  people have access to health care in America   After all  you just go to an emergency room             That   s what passes for universal health care in the greatest  wealthiest country on Earth     overcrowded  understaffed Emergency Rooms that raise everyone   s premiums and cost taxpayers more money          It   s shameful   And what   s even more shameful is that nine million of the Americans who are forced to wait in Emergency Rooms when they get sick     who have no health insurance at all     are children          Children who did not choose where they were born or how much money their parents have   Children whose development depends on the care and nourishment they receive in those early years   Children who any parent  anywhere  should want to protect at any cost          Now  we can shade the truth and pretend there are only one million uninsured like the President says   We can make excuses for this neglect or we can just ignore it altogether  but as long as there are nine million children in the United States of America with no health insurance  it is a betrayal of the ideals we hold as Americans          It   s not who we are  and today is our chance to prove it          We know that CHIP works   Because of CHIP  6 million children who   d otherwise be uninsured have health care today   Because of CHIP  millions of children are protected when their parents lose their health care          Because of CHIP  individual states like my home state of Illinois are building on its success to expand health coverage even further   And because of CHIP  millions of children with asthma  traumatic injuries  and mental health conditions  are able to see a doctor and get the treatment they need           Even though the uninsured rate among low income children fell by more than one third in the years after CHIP was enacted  the trend reversed two years ago   And since then  we   ve seen growing numbers of uninsured children          Uninsured children are twice as likely as insured children to miss out on needed medical care  including doctor visits and checkups          One quarter of uninsured children don   t get any medical care at all   And those who do  get lower quality care   Even with the same illnesses and conditions  whether it   s an ear infection or appendicitis  studies have found that uninsured children get different treatment  and often suffer more as a result   One study even found that uninsured children who are admitted to a hospital with injuries are twice as likely to die there as children who do have insurance          And to put this problem in the larger context  we know that when a child gets sick and can   t get treated     or receives inadequate treatment     he misses more days of school   And when he misses more school days  he begins to do worse relative to his peers   And that can have long term consequences on his chances in life   That   s not something I   d want for either of my two young daughters or for any other American child         So let   s get serious and solve this problem   Let   s reauthorize CHIP   Let   s make sure that the 6 million children who are now covered through the program continue to be covered     and let   s extend coverage to an additional 3 2 million uninsured children         But we also know that the question of children   s health care is tied to the larger question of universal care in this country  Because we know that when we cover parents  we also cover children   And that   s something we   ve seen in Illinois   When I was a State Senator  I was able to help extend health care coverage to an additional 150 000 parents and their children   So if we   re serious about covering every child  we have to cover every parent as well          The American people have been waiting for us to act on health care for far too long   And starting by covering more children should not be a difficult issue to agree on

               Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with her Democratic colleagues to call on the Administration to take major action following the theft of veterans   and servicemembers   personal data  At a press conference  the Senators accused the Administration of carelessness and incompetence in dealing with the public on the true nature of the problem and charged that the Department has acted too slowly to address the serious issues involved with the data theft            As a nation  we were all deeply concerned when we learned of this Veteran  s Affairs data theft incident  26 5 million veterans had their personal data stolen and their privacy compromised   Now we learn that millions of currently serving members of our Nation  s Armed Forces were included in this security breach as well     Senator Clinton said    Our veterans served our nation and deserve better than to have their private information treated so carelessly    And the American men and women serving so selflessly today need less to worry about  not more             In a letter to the U S  Comptroller General  the Senators urged him to conduct an in depth Government Accountability Office study to get the facts on this breach and to address the vulnerabilities that led to it  The Senators also announced they were introducing legislation sponsored by Senator Akaka  to address the unauthorized removal or use of personal information maintained in Federal databases   The legislation would compliment existing law and provide another tool for the protection of health information              This Administration  s incompetence has now gone digital    and the men and women who serve our country  and their families  are the ones who will pay the price     Senator Clinton said     We owe it to our men and women in uniform to protect their privacy   We need to get to the bottom of this and prevent it from happening again               Soldiers serving in harms way should not bear the additional burden of worrying about identity theft   And we should not place still more pressure on the families back home in dealing with the ripple effects of potential or actual identity theft     Senator Clinton said          The   Data Theft Protection Act of 2006     would establish Federal penalties for anyone who knowingly and without authorization views  uses  downloads or removes any means of identification or individually identifiable health information that is in a Federal database   It would also make illegal the transfer of such information to any computer  network  database or other format used to store information that is not a Federal database   It establishes Federal penalties for any person who uses a means of identification or individually identifiable health information obtained directly or indirectly from a Federal database in furtherance of a violation of a Federal or State criminal law   The bill is designed to serve as deterrent to prevent future breaches of personal information from Federal databases           A copy of the Senators   letter is attached          June 14  2006  Mr  David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548      Dear Mr  Walker       Last week  several major newspapers reported that the personal information of 80  of our active military personnel was included in the May 3rd heist of a personal computer belonging to a Department of Veterans Affairs employee   According to the VA  the information contained the names  Social Security Numbers  and birthdates of 2 2 million military personnel 1    A spokesman from the department said 1 1 million active duty personnel  430 000 National Guard members  and 645 000 Reservists were among the 26 5 million identities stolen from the laptop computer            These recent revelations directly contradict the Department of Veterans Affairs initial response to the massive data breach that occurred in early May  The New York Times reported that the May 22nd announcement included the larceny   of up to 26 5 million veterans  and their spouses     2  Yet  at no time were any active military personnel  or members of Congress  aware that the personal security of the bulk of our military apparatus was jeopardized           Given this new revelation and the continued failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide accurate  timely and complete information to the American people or the Congress  we are writing to request the Government Accountability Office further investigate this matter           This security breach not only threatens the identity and financial security of millions of veterans and active military personnel  but also the safety and security of our troops and their families   Security experts have suggested that the data theft may have profound consequences on the safety of our troops      There is a global black market in this sort of information    and you suddenly have a treasure trove of information on the U S  military that is available    said James Lewis  director of technology and public policy at CSIS     3           Unfortunately  this new disclosure by the VA is just the latest example in a long record of incompetence and deception within the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Bush administration            The Department of Veterans Affairs has shown a pattern of careless  and possibly even deceitful  communication  both within the department itself and to the Congress and the public at large with respect to this data loss  Secretary Nicholson was not informed about the data theft until 13 days after the burglary  When Senator Susan Collins asked him how it was possible he was not informed immediately  he replied that it was unclear  4   Additionally  officials in the department did not report the May 3rd data theft until over two weeks later on May 22nd  leaving millions of veterans unknowingly at high risk of identity theft   Also  when the department learned that the personal information of active military personnel was compromised  Secretary Nicholson badly underestimated the number of troops put in harms way   His estimation of 50 000 Navy and National Guard members affected accounted for just a tiny fraction of the total number of American troops exposed  5          The information security breach is even more egregious considering VA  after continual security audits  was well aware of the vulnerability of its data security  According to VA Inspector General George Opfer    In all four audits of the VA Security Program issued since 2001  we reported serious vulnerabilities that remain uncorrected  These reports highlight specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited  but the recurring themes in these reports are the need for centralization  remediation  and accountability in VA information security  Since the FY 2001 report  we reported weakness in physical security  electronic security  wireless security  personnel security  and FISMA reporting     6          For all these reasons  we ask that the Government Accountability Office make an in depth inquiry into the causes of this serious breach  the adequacy of the VA  s response  and the impact to the veterans and military community at large   More specifically  we desire that the GAO               Provide a full and complete assessment of the security breach  affected personnel and the impact of this incident             Review and evaluate the impact of the delay by VA officials to analyze the contents of the stolen data and further assess its content              Review the adequacy of VA  s response to recommendations by GAO and the VA Inspector General to make VA compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act   Please describe in detail VA  s implementation efforts or responses in this regard             Identify any needed legislative solutions that would address requirements for notifying citizens in a timely manner of breaches or losses of personal information from Federal databases           Review VA  s response  and the adequacy of that response  to strengthen personal information security management               Review the adequacy of existing laws  such as the Privacy Act  to protect personal information contained with Federal electronic databases and provide recommendations on how these laws might strengthen in light of current vulnerabilities and the state of technology             Review and evaluate the impact of the data theft on the veterans   community  active  guard and reserve members and what efforts are being undertaken by VA to ensure that the stolen personal information is not misused  whether those steps are adequate  what additional measures might be necessary to protect those whose information was lost  and finally  how to deal with any harm caused to those individuals from this breach          We look forward to working with you regarding this most important matter          Sincerely          ,0

1168,February 15  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton on Her Vote on the Nomination of Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of Homeland Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              There is no position in government of greater importance to the security of our country and of my home state of New York than that of the Secretary of Homeland Security  It has been said before  but it bears repeating    our Nation faces a new kind of challenge to our way of life  I have no doubt we will overcome this challenge  but we will do so only by maintaining and strengthening our civil society and our commitment to being a force for decency and respect for law in the world  After rigorous review of Judge Chertoff s testimony and my personal discussion with him  I have come to the conclusion that Judge Chertoff is professionally qualified to be Secretary of Homeland Security and that he understands and respects the values that the Secretary works to defend         Judge Chertoff s stated commitment to threat and vulnerability based funding and his repeated expressions of support for policies that are essential to the security of New Yorkers are decisive factors in my decision to vote for his confirmation  And we will need Judge Chertoff s support more than ever as Congress deals with the President s FY 2006 budget  I have repeatedly called upon the Administration to implement threat based homeland security funding so that resources go to the states and areas where they are needed most  On the first day of this Congress  I introduced the Domestic Defense Fund Act of 2005 providing  7 billion annually to local communities  states and first responders to be allocated using threat  risk  and vulnerability based criteria  While Judge Chertoff has expressed support for threat  and vulnerability based funding  we will need his help convincing the Bush Administration to follow through on his support         The FY 2006 budget also seeks to cut or eliminate a number of essential first responder programs and proposes no funding for the SAFER Act  There was no funding for the COPS hiring program  the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program  or the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program    named after a NYPD officer killed in the line of duty    that has provided states and local governments with funds to reduce crime and increase public safety  This is a shameful reduction  especially as our fire fighters  police  emergency service workers and other first responders continue to be on the front lines of our nation s homeland defense  The President  s budget also failed to provide funding for the 2 000 new border patrol agents  many of whom will be dedicated specifically to our Northern Border  Judge Chertoff must be willing to fight hard for full funding of these and other programs essential to the keeping our communities safe from crime while also buttressing our homeland defense         Finally  I was pleased to learn that Judge Chertoff testified that his personal experiences have given him a thorough appreciation and respect for state and local perspectives  I agree wholeheartedly that we need to work in partnership with state and local governments  When it comes to securing the homeland  states and local communities must be full partners        I remain deeply concerned about the misguided and potentially unconstitutional policies that have been drafted by the Justice Department and implemented by the Administration in its prosecution of the war on terror and in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq  And I am grateful that the Senate devoted time to a thorough discussion of these important issues  However  these concerns have nothing to do with Judge Chertoff s personal abilities and commitment to public service  and Judge Chertoff has expressed his personal disagreement with many of these policies  Ultimately  his roots in the New Jersey New York region  his personal experiences  and his expressions of commitment to the rule of law and programs and policies that will help protect New York and our nation have secured my vote in favor of confirmation  I call upon Judge Chertoff to work with Congress to ensure that the Administration is vigilant in its efforts to protect our liberty and keep our nation secure         Finally  I encourage Judge Chertoff to meet with New York s 9 11 families as soon as possible after he is confirmed  These men  women and children  who have lost so much  are in need of continuing help and also are a source of great expertise and wisdom  They are the true champions for securing our homeland  and I think the Department could gain a lot by listening to them             ,0
1370,December 17  2007 Clinton Measure to Bar Bonuses for Underperforming Homeland Security Contractors Included in Omnibus Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she has secured inclusion of a measure in the Omnibus Appropriations bill that will bar the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  from giving award fees or bonuses to contractors without regard to performance   Senator Clintons amendment requires DHS to give award fees  or bonuses  to contractors only if the contractor meets specific outlined stipulations in their contract   The Omnibus Appropriations bill is expected to be considered this week by the House and Senate       The Department of Homeland Security should be holding their contractors accountable and not rewarding bad behavior   With high risk areas like New York fighting for precious homeland security funds  it is outrageous that DHS is awarding bonuses to contractors that they havent even earned  said Senator Clinton      A number of reports have revealed that the Department of Homeland Security has been giving private contractors award fees without proper justification   In 2005  the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  awarded a contract to Boeing initially estimated to be worth  508 million  The Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security found that the TSA gave Boeing at least  44 million in award fees without evaluating the companys performance  Earlier this year  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  found that despite documented problems in schedule  performance  cost control  and contract administration throughout the first year of the Coast Guard Deepwater contract  a DHS contractor had received a rating of 87 percent  which fell in the very good range and resulted in an award fee of  4 million     Senator Clintons amendment requires DHS to give award fees or bonuses to contractors only if the contractor meets the stipulations related to cost  schedule  and performance outlined in the contract  If a contractor receives a poor performance evaluation  exceeds costs specified in the contract  or does not meet the deadlines specified in the contract  then the contractor will not receive an award fee or bonus from DHS    Just recently HRC wrote to the DHS Inspector General calling for an investigation into the contracting practices by DHS   Click here to view Senator Clintons letter          ,0

                         Thank you so much   And I could not have had a better economic development partner in Upstate New York than Lee Beaulac and Rural Opportunities  Inc   We ve had a lot of fun   It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to bring people together to talk about what we were going to do to reinvest in communities and provide economic opportunities and housing and healthcare  microcredit and just a whole a range of issues that we have worked on together for the last six years   But Lee does know how the public sector and the private sector both work and he combines that knowledge with a real passion to improve the lives of people   So I want to thank you in front of all of your peers and your colleagues  someone who I am very grateful to work with and I am so pleased that he could introduce me              I also want to thank John Taylor because the fact that NCRC is now celebrating 30 years of CRA is a big accomplishment   There were lots of times when we were checking for a pulse   Was CRA still beating   Was it going to be there as a tool that we could use for reinvestment   And thanks to all of you  it is   And we re going to strengthen it   We re going to begin to strengthen it in the Democratic Congress   And it s certainly one of my priorities because I believe in community development investment funds   I believe in empowerment zones   I believe in the tools that we know work in communities   And I was proud during the Clinton Administration to work with some of you and to visit some of the projects like the one that Lee was talking about in Newburgh   So there s a lot of work that needs to go on and we have a lot of good examples of what will make it possible for us to bring people into the mainstream economically and provide economic opportunity across all sectors of our economy and every region of our country             And I want to thank Irvin Henderson  the chairman of the board of NCRC and all of the board members because obviously they are committed to doing what does work   And to all the New Yorkers who are here today  thank you for being partners in what we have done together over the last six years           NCRC stands firmly behind a really simple idea that when Americans are given the tools for success  Americans succeed   You know  when the American government is on our side  we all do better together   And it is important that we renew that mission every so often because we face new challenges           You know  when my husband started running for president back in 1992  which wasn t exactly the dark ages  some might think it was  but I know it wasn t   It was not that long ago  There wasn t really an Internet   There was an Internet that existed for scientists to communicate  but there weren t hundreds of millions of websites   We have changed so much   And we have to keep asking ourselves  what do we do to bring opportunity to everyone            And Lee mentioned one of my projects up in the North Country of New York  And that was to put small  rural businesses on EBay   Because I said to myself  you know  there s not much of a market up here   These folks are working really  really hard and they re producing high quality products but they don t have many people to sell them to   So what we did was work with EBay to put these businesses on the Internet  help them with their websites  help them get some technical assistance so when the orders started coming in  they would know how to meet them             Lee mentioned one of the businesses we put on  which was a soap maker   Really high quality soap  she made  in a very painstaking process that was pure and really traditional   Somebody working for Oprah came across one of her soaps and one day after she got on EBay  she gets an order for  40 000 worth of soap   She had to go out and get every person she knew in her community to come in and help her make soap   So that was a good problem to have   And that s the kind of challenges that we want to overcome by being innovative and creative together            Well  obviously I believe in the basic bargain that I was raised with   You know  if you work hard  you play by the rules  you ought to be able to get ahead   And that s what I was raised with and I think that is at the heart of the American Dream            Well unfortunately  we still have too much of America that is held back by a lack of capital  investment and opportunity   Middle class families and families struggling to reach and stay in the middle class are really being squeezed from all sides            You know Americans are struggling to pay for college costs and energy costs and healthcare costs  because after all  premiums have gone up 90 percent since 2000   And I m concerned that we re not facing the problems that we have  We re not meeting our challenges the way previous generations of Americans did             We have 47 million people without health insurance  When you have 300 million people dependent on foreign oil  when you have more than 90 000 of our fellow citizens still living in trailers along the Gulf coast  it is time for a change and it is time for  inaudible           I want to focus on one aspect of the American Dream  of that basic bargain  because I am worried about homeownership   And as we have seen in recent days  the basic bargain that may be breaking down is homeownership            There has been a lot of attention recently on the volatility in the subprime housing market  But the subprime fallout takes a toll on families as well   These are not just statistics  these are flesh and blood people who are so proud of that first home  who felt like they finally had a real foothold in the American middle class that they were going to have their children in a safer environment            Now we know that there were more bankruptcies in America last year than college graduates   And half of those bankruptcies were due to an illness and people unable to pay their medical costs            So a lot of these new homeowners are one illness away from foreclosure  They re one job loss away  They re one  let s cut your hours away   They are hanging on  Because despite what you hear from the happy talkers on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and for some of those folks they put on TV  wages have been stagnant  haven t they            So you ve got CEO pay up  You ve got corporate profits up  You ve got productivity up  which means that we re all working harder than ever before   But the folks who are doing the work are not getting rewarded   And a lot of those folks during the 90s  when we created 22 million new jobs and lifted more people out of poverty than at any time in our history  they felt that we and our country were on the right track  didn t they   And they thought the sky was the limit   They were going to send that child to college  They were going to get that home   Well  now we are concerned  and NCRC has been sounding the alarm to try to wake us up for the last several years   Well  I sure hope we re awake now          You can t be surprised  can you   Because the alarm bell about the subprime home market has largely gone unnoticed by this Administration because they keep arguing we have to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy   They keep arguing that a  9 trillion national debt and an increasing trade deficit    the highest in history    are signs of increasing strength   Well  I have to say that I don t buy that   I think there are trouble signs below the horizon   Maybe they re not as obvious to some  but you keep sounding that alarm  Because I believe that we ve got to take action            According to most recent statistics  delinquent payments now affect more than 13 percent of subprime loans in our country   That s the highest level in four years   Now  many would attribute this rise to unsophisticated homebuyers  even irresponsible buyers  or the subprime market itself   But the foreclosure rate for all mortgages increased by more than 17 percent in the last quarter of 2006   That s the highest foreclosure rate in four decades           So when somebody tells you this subprime market thing is no big deal  or maybe  you know what  let the buyer beware  these folks signed on the dotted line  it s their responsibility  Ask them why the rate for all homeowners is so high   Because the economy is not supporting homeownership the way we need it to   And after all  in the absence of an alternative  the subprime market has opened the doors to millions of families and responsible lenders and the market are rightfully casting out some of the worst actors in the subprime industry   But the market will not address the millions of families trapped in unworkable mortgages  hounded by delinquency and facing the grim possibility of foreclosure            Now there will always be risk  and we cannot absolve it and should not absolve homebuyers of his or her responsibility   But we should make the rules clear and level the playing field            The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street   It s a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families            So what are some of the things we need to do   We need to expand the role of the FHA to issue more mortgages at better rates to these homeowners   We need to give consumers more counseling and information  prevent families from being trapped in high interest loans with pre payment penalties and in some cases  allow more breathing room from foreclosure   This market is clearly broken and if we don t fix it  it could threaten our entire housing market  which in turn would threaten our entire economy            So this is a serious issue and I m so pleased to be in front of a serious group to just spend a few minutes talking with you about it            You know  often the plight of these families are lost   We just don t focus on who they are  but we all know them   I bet if we had the people who served lunch today come in and asked them to raise their hands  you d see folks who bought their first home  wouldn t you   Probably some in this crowd know people personally who have   And we know that very often people are paying in rent what they should be paying in mortgage to actually own something  but they don t have anyone to help them cross that bridge            What we have to do is try to figure out how to help people who because of their credit history or a lack of savings because they re living paycheck to paycheck or for other reasons are diverted into the higher rates of the subprime market   Well that s why I think the Federal Housing Administration must be made to work better             Because after all the FHA remains an industry leader in serving minority  first time  and low income home buyers   And it continues to help people who don t qualify for prime mortgages to avoid risky and in some cases predatory mortgage products   And  very importantly the rate of minority lending through FHA has grown to more than one in three after many years when it didn t look like that was very welcome  right          So unfortunately the FHA s impact on the marketplace has declined  because of inefficiencies and personnel shortages  they cannot keep up with demands at FHA   In the 1990 s  FHA backed loans represented about 12 percent of the market   Today  it s closer to three percent            This is another one of these government programs that this administration wants to starve and by doing so cut off the dream of homeownership   Now  I will soon be reintroducing my 21st Century Housing Act  which will take steps to modernize the agency by allowing the FHA to reinvest a portion of its revenues in new employees and information technology  to develop new mortgages to meet market demand and to position the FHA to work more efficiently with lenders and to serve more borrowers            I also want to raise the FHA mortgage limits for high cost of living areas so it can reach home buyers in more expensive markets   Many people in New York cannot afford a home within two hours of where they work   If the FHA limit were higher  they could afford a home and we should make that happen            But what if that family that we re trying to get into their home decides they will seek out a subprime loan   Well  we have to put ourselves in the shoes of a parent signing a mortgage product unaware of a complicated  escalating payment formula that has been worked out on some computer that has balloon payments and pre payment penalties  which includes the cost of taxes and insurance  and other added on costs that the owner doesn t really understand and nobody takes the time to explain them   Clear and easy to understand disclosure  plain talk meant to inform  not to confuse must be the starting point   Buyer beware is just not enough           So  I also propose a stop to pre payment penalties designed to trap borrowers when payments skyrocket   These penalties apply to 70 percent of sub prime mortgages but less than five percent of prime mortgages            Now  we can imagine a family stuck in this subprime catch 22   A family tries to be responsible and pay down on their principal and even make payments ahead of time   But  in the fine print they learn that unlike everything else in their world  if they pay things off and get ahead  there s going to be penalties imposed on them   This is totally perverse   So they re stuck waiting for the rate to go up instead of being given the opportunity to protect themselves   And then they may very well find themselves on the brink of foreclosure            I m also calling for independent counseling to be made available  so when buyers like this family sign the dotted line they understand what they are signing   And as you know from your own experience at NCRC more than one third of subprime borrowers could qualify for lower rate prime mortgages  but many low income and minority borrowers are simply unaware of there options           Finally  we also know that sometimes because of a sudden catastrophic illness or an accident that disables or injures the prime bread winner  or other circumstances  very responsible families have trouble making their payments   Now unfortunately  homeowners in distress often simply miss payment after payment and eventually lose their homes   A better alternative would be to create incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and to work out solutions before foreclosure happens   Lenders might for example  give borrowers a period of a foreclosure time out  during which borrowers will have the opportunity to put their financial houses in order and to work out a payment plan   This proposal can build on the great efforts that NCRC is already leading with your Consumer Rescue Fund Initiative   And I want to applaud you for this because this is wonderful agenda to restore the homeownership market and your network of community groups and responsible lenders and state and local governments should strengthen our ability to respond to this crisis            But  you know  really when it comes to homeownership we should get back to that basic bargain   If you play by the rules  you can count on the rules being fair  open  and honest   And responsible lenders and community organizations need to be encouraged to really live up to their end of the bargain            I want to see more opportunities for lenders to go into communities that have not always been well served   And I know it can be done   Several years ago  I challenged New York s credit unions to reach a goal of  100 million in responsible home loans to first time buyers in under served areas   These were areas where usually the only alternative would have been a sub prime or risky mortgage   The result  well  a year later the credit unions all came back to my office to report that they have exceeded their goal   They announced  150 million in loans and they are still  inaudible             I think it s also important that we look for ways for the government to incentivize these changes and to provide some kind of safety net if the worst happens and escalating foreclosures begin to mount            You know  it s true that I travel around the country a lot now and speak in big cities and very small towns just as I did throughout my years in the Senate in New York   And there are a lot of people who are feeling less and less connected to one another   You know  it s ironic that in this age of virtual reality where people are on the Internet and bending over working their text messages and blackberries that there is a sense that perhaps we are not as secure as we once were   You know  people are working more  but their jobs are less secure   The whole family has cell phones  but finds it nearly impossible to sit down around the dinner table together   Our nation is growing more interdependent in the global economy  but increasingly feels divided here at home            Well  I believe we can pursue policies together that lift us all up and homeownership is one piece of that puzzle   And that is why it s so important that what you re doing continues            And the Community Reinvestment Act was a wise decision thirty years ago by Congress and President Carter   And it has made a tremendous difference   Bank lending to minorities and lower and moderate income borrowers has gone up 20 percent since then   But we still have a lot to do            I ve done a lot of work in microcredit over the years going back to Arkansas when I worked with my husband and Dr  Muhammad Yunus who just won the Noble Peace Prize for the Grameen Bank to bring Grameen Bank techniques to Arkansas   And I ve been in many different settings with borrowers and lenders who are doing microcredit   I ll never forget a woman in Denver who said to me   more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else    We need to figure out how we re going to open up the commercial lending sector and continue to provide more alternatives as well           And when I go out and speak with my constituents  they re not asking for a handout   They re just asking once again to be part of this great American Dream  this adventure that we are all on together   They just want the tools to help them realize their own ambitions            Now  when I created an organization called New Jobs for New York  to try and bring more capital from New York City upstate  I went around and met with a lot of the entrepreneurs who were trying to break through and look for a chance to get the capital they needed   And time and time again there was just no place for them to go            Well  it would be in America s interest to have a big national capital fund that would make bets again on smart people who are willing to work hard   I want to do that in the strategic energy area   You know  I meet people all over the country who have good ideas about alternative energy  but they re not getting the funding they need to translate that into reality   And when it comes to the Renewal Communities which the Clinton administration started back in 2000  well  I see the results of those investments in tourism along the Erie Canal  which had basically been just left to wither   I see those investments in the local wine industry in New York   And I think if we pursue a comprehensive agenda  urban and rural  leaving nobody out  then I think we re going to have the consensus we need in the country to start solving problems again   Because that s what I believe in           I believe that if we put our heads together and we start looking at the facts and the evidence  and put the ideology on the back shelf somewhere  because I ve never seen any ideology that helps you solve a problem  you ve got to get together and see what the real facts are  And we know a lot about what works  we ve just been stymied a little bit in the last six years   But we re going to get rid of those roadblocks  and we re going to roll up our sleeves and we re going to starting acting liking Americans again  We re going to start solving our problems together          We brought electricity to rural communities  we brought interstate highway systems  we re going to bring broadband deployment so that every community can be connected up to the global economy  We re going to have a new housing project program that is going to invest in local communities  We re going to have universal healthcare coverage and we re going to use energy to create new jobs   We can do this            Thank you all          ,0
1342,April 17  2007 Senators Clinton  Schumer and Menendez Call for Federal Funding to Fight Asian Longhorned Beetle Infestation In New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Funds will Support Efforts to Completely Eradicate Infestations by 2014                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Following reports of new infestations of the devastating Asian Longhorned Beetle  ALB  in Queens and Staten Island  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer and Robert Menendez  with the support of Senator Frank Lautenberg  are calling for sufficient federal funding to help eradicate the beetle in parts of New York and New Jersey  In a letter to the Senate Agricultural Appropriations Subcommittee  the Senators requested  48 million in federal funds to help stop the infestation           Reports that infestations of the Asian Longhorned Beetle have spread across New York City and New Jersey demand that we act swiftly and effectively   said Senator Clinton   The Asian Longhorned Beetle poses a severe threat to New York City  with a potential to wipe out nearly half our city s trees at a cost of more than  2 billion  It is essential that we provide adequate financial support for our efforts to eradicate this dangerous and costly infestation            Across New York City  we ve already seen firsthand the devastating toll these voracious creatures can have on our city s trees and parks   said Senator Schumer   With thousands of trees in the City and on Long Island already dead  and a new quarantine called on Staten Island  it is no exaggeration to say that if additional money is not secured to eliminate the Asian Longhorned Beetle  we run the risk of losing millions of trees in New York State that clean our air  cool our climate  attract thousands of tourists  and improve the overall quality of life  We must act swiftly to ensure that the USDA s elimination program is adequately funded  in order to provide it with all the weapons it needs to permanently eradicate this invasive species            Without proper action to combat them  these beetles have the potential to cause serious environmental and budgetary damage  They re killing our trees and hitting us in the wallet  and they should be stopped   Senator Menendez said          First discovered in Greenpoint  Brooklyn in 1996  the beetle is characterized by its nearly endless appetite for hardwood  already destroying over 8 400 trees  The beetle puts 35 percent of American urban trees at serious risk  at a combined replacement value of  669 billion  The threat is even greater in New York City  with 47 percent of its 5 2 million trees susceptible to Asian Longhorned Beetle infestation           In their letter to the subcommittee  the Senators asked for  48 million to be included in the FY 2008 Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration  and Related Agencies Appropriations bills to be dedicated to the eradication of the Asian Longhorned Beetle  The Senators also welcomed the support of Senator Lautenberg  D NJ    Senator Lautenberg  who is a member of the Appropriations Committee  expressed his support for this funding and will work with the Appropriations Committee on this issue          Although relatively easy to stop and eliminate once found  identification of infestations remains difficult with a limited number of inspectors available  The U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  has been conducting programs to eradicate the Asian Longhorned Beetle  With an annual appropriation of  48 million  sufficient resources would be provided to eradicate the Asian Longhorned Beetle by 2014          The full text of the Senators  letter to Chairman Kohl and Ranking Member Bennett is as follows          Dear Chairman Kohl and Ranking Member Bennett     As you move forward with the FY 2008 Agriculture  Rural Development  Food and Drug Administration  and Related Agencies Appropriations bills  we respectfully request that you include  48 million for the eradication by the Asian Longhorned beetle  ALB              The ALB is a devastating pest of hardwood trees including maple  elm  willow  poplar  and birch   The ALB  first discovered in the New York City area in 1996 and subsequently in Illinois and New Jersey  is a local  regional  and national environmental threat   The ALB is active in nine counties in New York and New Jersey and has already destroyed over 8 400 trees   In the United States  35  of all urban trees are at risk  at a combined replacement value of  669 billion   The need to increase resources to combat the ALB is paramount            The U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  program has been conducting programs to eradicate the ALB   The ALB has not been detected in Illinois since 2003 and while gains have been made in Illinois  the threat of the ALB in New York and New Jersey is severe   47 percent of the 5 2 million trees in New York City are susceptible to the infestation of ALB with an estimated the replacement value of these trees at  2 2 billion   On the basis of forested areas  New Jersey could lose 25 4  of its tree cover or 250 million trees if the ALB is not eradicated           An annual appropriation of  48 million will provide the resources needed for the eradication of ALB by 2014   Failure to provide the resources to eradicate the ALB will result in the extended duration of this eradication program and the loss of thousands of trees   A shorter duration of this program provides less opportunity for the ALB to spread naturally or through the movement of infested host material that would result in the need for additional resources            We are pleased that our colleague  Senator Frank Lautenberg  who is a member of the Appropriations Committee  has also expressed his support for this funding and will work with the Appropriations Committee on this issue           We thank you for the consideration of this request           Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Robert Menendez         ,0
1728,"SENATORS PUSH FOR FISA BILL WITH MORE OVERSIGHT, WITHOUT TELECOM IMMUNITY
  As the Senate prepares to consider legislation to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a group of senators is urging Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to make the FISA bill passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC) the base bill to be considered on the Senate floor. The SJC bill makes significant improvements to the FISA bill that was reported by the Senate Intelligence Committee. It enhances judicial oversight of broad new surveillance authorities, contains protections for innocent Americans, and does not provide immunity to telecom companies that allegedly cooperated with the administration's warrantless wiretapping program. The Senators expressing their support for the SJC FISA bill in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Reid are Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI), Chris Dodd (D-CT), Barack Obama (D-IL), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Joe Biden (D-DE), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Jim Webb (D-VA), Ted Kennedy (D-MA), and Barbara Boxer (D-CA). 
   ""The Judiciary Committee FISA bill fixes many of the flaws of the surveillance law we enacted in August and the new bill approved by the Intelligence Committee. Everyone agrees that we should give our intelligence officials the tools they need to go after suspected terrorists. There's no reason we can't do that while still protecting the privacy of innocent Americans and ensuring adequate oversight of these broad new surveillance authorities - and without setting the dangerous precedent of granting retroactive immunity to companies that allegedly participated in an unlawful program,"" Senator Feingold said.
   ""Of course we have to do everything we can to protect the American people, but we must fight international terrorism in a way that is consistent with our Constitution and the Bill of Rights,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said.
   ""I strongly urge the Majority Leader to take up the Judiciary Committee's version of the FISA legislation. It is absolutely essential that as the Senate begins debating reforms to FISA we do not include retroactive immunity provisions for telecommunications companies that may have engaged in illegal conduct. Additionally, the Judiciary Committee's version of the FISA legislation contains much stronger safeguards which will serve to protect Americans against the President's warantless wiretapping program,"" Senator Dodd said.
   ""The Judiciary Committee bill restores oversight and accountability to the FISA program without unnecessarily providing retroactive immunity to companies that cooperated with the Administration's warrantless wiretapping program. It is my hope that this bill will be considered by the full Senate,"" Senator Obama said.
   ""I believe that the bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee strikes the healthiest balance between protecting our national security interests and safeguarding the basic civil and constitutional rights of American citizens,"" said Senator Webb. ""The Judiciary Committee bill also remains silent on immunity for the telecommunications companies, which is appropriate. If there is a compelling case for immunity, Senators supporting it will have the opportunity to make their case on the Senate floor.""
   ""Congress must enact a FISA bill that will produce needed intelligence, protect the privacy of Americans and respect the rule of law. The bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee does those things without undermining the structure of FISA and the rule of law by giving retroactive immunity to phone companies that may have illegally invaded the privacy of millions of Americans,"" Senator Kennedy said.

271,   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Anti Lynching Apology Resolution   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Anti Lynching Apology Resolution Tuesday  June 14  2005  Statement of Senator Barack Obama  Anti Lynching Apology Resolution  Monday  June 13th  2005  Remarks as delivered Mr  OBAMA  Mr  President  I rise in strong support of this resolution  Before I make any further remarks  I would like to recognize Doria D  Johnson  and thank her for coming  She is from Evanston  IL  Ms  Johnson is the great  great granddaughter of Anthony Crawford  a South Carolina farmer who was lynched nearly 100 years ago for the crime of being a successful Black farmer  I am sure that this day has special meaning for her  and for the other family members of those who were impacted by these great tragedies of the past  I thank her and others for being here today   Since America s darkest days of Jim Crow  separate but equal  fire hoses  church bombings  cross burnings and lynchings  the people of this great Nation have found the courage  on occasion  to speak up and speak out so that we can right this country s wrongs  and walk together down that long road of transformation that continues to perfect our Union  It is a transformation that brought us the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act  a transformation that led to the first Black Member of Congress  and the first Black and White children holding hands in the same playground and the same school  a transformation without which I would not be standing here speaking today  But I am  And I am proud because  thanks to this resolution  we are taking another step in acknowledging a dark corner of our history  We are taking a step that allows us  after looking at the 4 700 deaths from lynchings  the hate that was behind those deaths  and this Chamber s refusal to try and stop them  to finally say that we were wrong   There is a power in acknowledging error and mistake  It is a power that potentially transforms not only those who were impacted directly by the lynchings  but also those who are the progeny of the perpetrators of these crimes  There is a piercing photographic exhibit in Chicago right now that displays some of the lynchings that occurred across the country over the past two centuries  These photographs show that what is often most powerful is not the gruesome aspects of the lynching itself  nor the terrible rending of the body that took place  No  what is most horrific  what is most disturbing to the soul is the photographs in which you see young little White girls or young little White boys with their parents on an outing  looking at the degradation of another human being  One wonders not only what the lynching did to the family member of those who were lynched  but also what the effect was on the sensibilities of those young people who stood there  watching   Now that we are finally acknowledging this injustice  we have an opportunity to reflect on the cruelties that inhabit all of us  We can now take the time to teach our children to treat people who look different than us with the same respect that we would expect for ourselves  So it is fitting  it is proper  and it is right that we are doing what we are doing today   However  I do hope  as we commemorate this past injustice  that this Chamber also spends some time doing something concrete and tangible to heal the long shadow of slavery and the legacy of racial discrimination  so that 100 years from now we can look back and be proud  and not have to apologize once again  That means completing the unfinished work of the civil rights movement  and closing the gap that still exists in health care  education  and income  There are more ways to perpetrate violence than simply a lynching   There is the violence that we subject young children to when they do not have any opportunity or hope  when they stand on street corners not thinking much of themselves  not thinking that their lives are worth living  That is a form of violence that this Chamber could do something about   As we are spending time apologizing today for these past failures of the Senate to act  we should also spend some time debating the extension of the Voting Rights Act and the best way to extend health care coverage to over 45 million uninsured Americans  We should be considering how we can make certain that college is affordable for young African American children  the great  great grandchildren or the great  great  great grandchildren of those who have been wronged  These are the ways we can finally ensure that the blessings of opportunity reach every single American  and finally claim a victory in the long struggle for civil rights   Today is a step in the right direction  Today s actions give us an opportunity to heal and to move forward  But for those who still harbor anger in their hearts  who still wonder how to move on from such terrible violence  it is worth reflecting for a moment on one remarkable individual  Mamie Till Mobley   Mamie Till Mobley s child Emmett was only 14 years old when they found him in the Mississippi River  beaten and bloodied beyond recognition  After Ms  Mobley saw her child  her baby  unrecognizable  his face so badly beaten it barely looked human  someone suggested that she should have a closed casket at his funeral  She said  No  we are going to have an open casket  and everybody is going to witness what they did to my child   The courage displayed by this mother galvanized the civil rights movement in the North and in the South  And  despite the immensity of the pain she felt  Mamie Till Mobley has repeatedly said  I never wasted a day hating  Imagine that  She never wasted a day hating  not one day   I rise today  thanking God that the United States Congress  the representatives of the American people and our highest ideals  will not waste one more day without issuing the apology that will continue to help us march down the path of transformation that Mamie Till Mobley has been on her whole life  and that the people in attendance in the gallery have been on for generations   I am grateful for this tribute  and I am looking forward to joining hands with my colleagues and the American people to make sure that when our children and grandchildren look back at our actions in this Chamber  we do not have something to apologize for   I yield the floor

1802,"WEEK IN REVIEW, OCT. 19
  Global Warming Senator Frank Lautenberg and Sanders released a set of global warming principles in anticipation of a compromise measure offered by Senators Joseph Lieberman and John Warner. ""This is no time for timidity"" and ""dealing with scientific reality is more important than cutting deals,"" Sanders said. ""I hope we can work together, but I think we have a distance to go to make that legislation better, stronger, more consistent with the science that's out there,"" Congress Daily reported. In a Senate floor statement, Sanders added: ""The problem is even worse than many have previously suggested.  
 If anything, the legislation Senator Boxer and I introduced in January, the strongest legislation introduced in Congress to address global warming, is probably too conservative to address the problem. It is likely that we should be even more aggressive in our targets and timetables for mandatory reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."" In a Times Argus op-ed, Drew Hudson of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group wrote: ""When Congress acts, it must act to pass a strong bill with the reductions in global warming pollution that science tells us are necessary to prevent catastrophic effects of global warming. Luckily, Sanders is at the table right now developing the legislation that the Senate is expected to consider this fall. Sanders has been a leading advocate for meeting the challenge of global warming with a strong, science-based response. Now more than ever we're counting on Sen. Sanders to ensure that the United States takes bold action, starting now."" To read the column at http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071018/OPINION04/710180363.

   Intelligence Surveillance Senator Sanders said he would oppose legislation on intelligence surveillance in the United States that would grant telecommunications companies immunity from lawsuits over privacy rights violations. A bill approved on Thursday by the Senate Intelligence Committee would give telephone companies immunity from about 40 pending lawsuits over their role in a Bush administration surveillance program instituted after September 2001. ""Of course we have to do everything we can to protect the American people, but we must fight international terrorism in a way that is consistent with our Constitution and the Bill of Rights,"" Sanders said. In Vermont, the Public Service Board is considering a probe into whether Verizon Vermont and AT&T gave the National Security Agency access to Vermont residents' phone records as part of a surveillance program. In July, a federal judge in California refused to dismiss legal requests by Vermont and four other states for information on the program.
   Blackwater USA In Iraq alone, there are roughly 180,000 private contractors working for American government agencies, including about 30,000 heavily-armed guards. The most notorious contractor, Blackwater USA, has been embroiled in controversy over the deaths last month of 17 Iraqis. A State Department contract with the private security firm, which escorts U.S. diplomats traveling outside the heavily protected Green Zone in Baghdad, expires in May. The contract should not be renewed, Sanders said. ""The Bush administration has made radical and dangerous changes in the structure of our military, and Congress needs to take a very hard look at that. To my mind, it is wrong and unacceptable for companies like Blackwater to operate outside of the chain of command of the United States military and United States government in Iraq. I also find it troubling when personnel employed by a company like Blackwater are paid far more than soldiers in the U.S. military who are putting their lives on the line every day.""

   Prescription Drugs Legislation was introduced by Sanders on Friday that would eliminate market exclusivity for new drugs, but give developers large cash rewards from a ""Medical Innovation Prize Fund"" when products improved health outcomes. By eliminating monopolies and allowing generic competition, prices on drugs would fall dramatically, saving taxpayers, employers and consumers more than $200 billion per year. Under the proposal, the current patent system would still be used, but patent owners would no longer be given monopoly rights to control the manufacturing and sale of products. Instead, patents would be used to establish who ""owns"" the right to the cash rewards given for new inventions. Drugs developed without patents would also be eligible for the prizes. ""As health-care costs continue to spiral, our nation must focus debate on why prescription drugs cost so much. Unfortunately, Congress has never delved into why the process that brings new drugs to market is so insanely expensive, inefficient, and ineffective. Senator Sanders' bill, 'The Medical Innovation Prize Act of 2007,' could at long last begin that debate,"" said Bill Vaughan of Consumers Union.

   Children's Health In the battle of Bush vs. the children, the children lost when the House on Thursday upheld the president's veto of a bill to provide health insurance to 10 million children. Bipartisan supporters of the measure vowed to send it back to him next month, with minor changes. ""For now, the insurance vote stands as the latest example of how Mr. Bush can still get his way on Capitol Hill?through artful use of veto threats and his veto pen,"" The New York Times reported.

                  Woodbury  NY   Today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with Long Island Business News to convene a panel of business  community and health care experts from throughout Long Island to take part in a health care forum in Woodbury   The forum was the third in the series Taking Action on Health Care and attracted numerous local stakeholders to discuss some of the major issues affecting the health care system  including affordability  quality and access   The panel also focused on challenges facing the region and some of the promising efforts underway           During her opening remarks  Senator Clinton outlined some of the major challenges affecting the health care system  our country is not getting its money  s worth for its health care dollars  we spend more per person than any nation in the world  yet our life expectancy ranks thirty fourth and more than 46 million Americans don  t have any health insurance at all  including 8 million children  the incentives inside our health care system are backwards and the payment system is upside down  too often paying for costly treatment but not for low cost prevention  and the market now rewards businesses that unload health care costs onto employees and local governments  while punishing companies that try to do the right thing              America has the greatest medical system in the world  We are blessed with dedicated  skilled  caring doctors and nurses  with world class hospitals and facilities and with medical innovation and research that  s second to none     Senator Clinton said    But we  ve also got 46 million people without insurance    including some 8 million children  Businesses and families in New York are struggling with rising health care costs and with health insurance premiums that are increasing five times faster than incomes             On Long Island  where residents already face an extraordinarily high cost of living  individuals and families pay 11  and 6  more in premiums  respectively  when compared to national averages           Senator Clinton emphasized that we need a uniquely American approach to solving our health care challenge and highlighted her work in the Senate to tackle these problems  including efforts to                Create an interoperable health IT infrastructure  marrying technology and quality to reduce medical errors  help contain costs and improve the care patients receive              Help patients make better  more informed choices by supporting comparative effectiveness studies to determine the most appropriate  safe  and cost effective treatments              Improve access to home and community based services that help seniors remain in their homes and communities   and provide tax credits for those who purchase long term care insurance              Create small business purchasing pools    like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP  and provide small businesses  including self employed Americans living and working at home  with tax credits for offering coverage  adding affordable choices and increasing purchasing power  and             Increase the focus of health care to include prevention             Today we have an opportunity to talk about health care  to think about how we reconcile our values with how we deliver that care    in the present and future    and to discuss how we can control cost  improve quality  and make our health care system accessible to every single American     Senator Clinton said    With our values as our guide  and with the greatest medical system in the world as our greatest resource  I believe we can begin to address the challenge    and forge a new direction in our health care system             Senator Clinton was joined by several panelists including Michael Dowling  President and Chief Executive Officer of the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System  Matt Crosson  President of the Long Island Association  Wendy Chaite  President of the Lymphatic Research Foundation  Johanna Richman  Chief Financial Officer at AHRC Nassau  and Jeff Rogoff  Vice President for Long Term Care at St  Catherine of Siena Medical Center and Martin Glynn  President   CEO of HSBC Bank USA           Senator Clinton is working on all fronts to tackle our health care challenge  She has collaborated with Senator Bill Frist to pass legislation in the Senate that would create an interoperable health IT infrastructure  She has joined with Senator Lindsey Graham to expand access to TRICARE military health care benefits for members of our National Guard and Reserve and worked tirelessly to make sure our veterans have the medical care they need and deserve  She has introduced legislation to fix problems plaguing the new Medicare prescription drug benefit  And  as co founder and co chair of the Senate Manufacturing Caucus  she is at the front lines of examining how we can help our manufacturers cope with the crushing costs of healthcare benefits           Senator Clinton has also fought to increase federal health care dollars for New York to ease cost pressures on local budgets and to enable more low income New York families to access healthcare coverage  helping secure a temporary increase in the federal matching rate for Medicaid which brought  1 4 billion to our state and cosponsoring legislation to extend the availability of the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   providing nearly  1 billion in additional funding for New York           The previous healthcare forums in the Taking Action on Health Care series were held in Buffalo at University of Buffalo and in Rochester          ,0

848,April 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at Senate HELP Committee Hearing on Equal Pay for Women Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thank you very much Senator Harkin and thank you for your dedication to this issue over so many years  And I do agree with Senator Enzi that I hope we can take up the Work Force Investment Act under a democratic majority   We weren t successful the last two Congresses  but now that we have a majority I think we ll be able to pass it  And I am particularly pleased because one of the provisions that is in it goes right along with what Senator Enzi has talked about  an amendment that I suggested to do more to encourage women to seek out non traditional employment in areas that historically were not very friendly to women   I think that is an important piece of the puzzle  but I don t think that obviates the need for us to enforce equal pay   And I believe that we have a real opportunity here with the legislation that I ve reintroduced  The Paycheck Fairness Act  with Senator Harkin s legislation  to really highlight the impact on families from the continuing discrimination in the work place               A 2003 Government Accountability Office report found that women s work patterns partially explain the differences between men s and women s earnings  but that even accounting for all other variables that are often used to justify the pay gap  such as time out of the work force to care for children or part time work  women still earn significantly less than men   The report also concluded that 20 percent of the wage gap could not be explained by factors other than discrimination   Now  conventional wisdom often associates the pay wage gap with low paying jobs  but this inequity is not limited to people who are in low paying jobs   Just recently  Wimbledon finally came around to paying the men and women champions the same amount of money            And we ve had a series of studies done at some of our finest universities like MIT  finding that when you held constant for time in the work force  task on job  commitment to a career  and these are some of the brightest men and women in the world who are physicists and mathematicians and chemists and everything else  there were still discriminatory effects that  to their credit  some of these institutions have been willing to face and begin to try to address             So  the Paycheck Fairness Act does three things   First  it does create strong penalties to punish those who violate the Equal Pay Act and it makes it illegal for employers to punish women who ask around about salaries   One of the things that I ve tried to do is put on my website a guide to helping women negotiate  because a lot of women are somewhat shy or reserved about negotiating over salaries   And they feel that they re just unequipped to go in and ask for higher pay or raise the fact that somebody they know  they re working with  doing a similar job or comparable job or same job  is getting paid more   And very often employers punish employees for finding out or trying to figure out what the salaries are            Second  the federal government should be a model employer in enforcing federal employment laws and will  under the Paycheck Fairness Act  be asked to use every weapon in our arsenal to ensure that women are paid the same amount as men for doing the same jobs   That includes reinstating the collection of gender based data in the current employment statistics survey  something that was discontinued under the Bush Administration  so we actually have up to date numbers showing how this issues are impacting our female employees around the country   Tax dollars should be used to bridge the equal pay gap  not make it wider            And finally  I do want to provide ways to help women strengthen their negotiation skills to help them stop discrimination before it starts or certainly to prevent it from continuing   And as Senator Harkin showed us on that graph  we have a lot work to do to get back to an economy that produces good wages for everybody with rising incomes   This is a part of that puzzle  because we certainly should not allow discrimination against women who are not only supporting themselves  but very often contributing to the family support or being the sole support of a family   But  it is in the interest of all us  men and women  and mothers and fathers  and daughters and sons to really set the goal of finally achieving equal wages for equal work   So  I want to thank Senator Harkin for his dedication to this issue and look forward to working with him to finally achieve the goal that we both

226,   Senator Obama and Rep  Slaughter Introduce Legislation to Protect Children from Lead Poisoning   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senator Obama and Rep  Slaughter Introduce Legislation to Protect Children from Lead Poisoning Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Frank Benenati  Slaughter  or Ben Labolt  Obama  14 Percent of child care facilities contain toxic lead Washington D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Louise M  Slaughter  D NY 28  today introduced legislation in the Senate and House respectively to protect children from lead poisoning   The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act requires that all non home based child care facilities  including Head Start program locations and kindergarten classrooms  be lead safe within five years  The bill also would establish a five year   42 6 million grant program to help local communities pay to make these facilities safe  and set up  best practices  standards for communities to test for and reduce lead hazards       Lead poisoning continues to pose an enormous threat to our children   s health and safety in day care facilities and schools in Illinois and across America     said Senator Obama     The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act requires all child care facilities to be certified lead safe within five years   The Environmental Protection Agency has endorsed key parts of this proposal with a rule that would require mandatory lead safety training and certification of our schools    contractors  We must act on these basic precautions to keep our children healthy and our schools lead free          Tens of millions of parents entrust the health and welfare of their children to schools and child care facilities every day  and yet millions of boys and girls are exposed to a lead level that will affect them for life     Rep  Slaughter said   This quiet tragedy is entirely avoidable  and we have to do everything in our power to make lead poisoning and its effects a thing of the past    While lead paint in older buildings is a primary source of exposure  lead can also enter tap water through corroded water lines and pipes  Lead in drinking water can account for as many as 60 percent of the exposure for infants and children who consume formula and concentrated juices   Children suffer the greatest negative health impacts  since lead adversely impacts physical and mental development  Specifically  exposure to lead toxins results in decreased intelligence and behavioral problems  and can also lead to kidney damage  anemia  reproductive disorders  seizures  coma  and even death   According to the Centers for Disease Control  about 310 000 children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  with poor and minority children disproportionately at risk  The problem of lead contamination is especially great in the Midwest and Northeast  where 40 percent of child care centers were built prior to 1960  BACKGROUND   The Impact on Illinois and New York  Illinois suffers from the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  with 20 5 percent of all reported elevated blood levels occurring within the state  Illinois  African American and Hispanic children are at significantly higher risk levels than non minority children   Each year in New York State  10 000 new children under the age of six are identified as having elevated blood lead levels  More than 200 000 children in New York contracted lead poisoning between 1992 and 2004  Children exposed to harmful levels of lead often require special education  medical care  and supervision  often exceeding  4 billion per year in the state alone   A National Epidemic  Nationally  lead poisoning affects 310 000 American children annually  and has been linked to serious health problems ranging from brain damage and hearing loss to comas and death   In 2003  the Department of Housing and Urban Development   s Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control found that 14 percent of licensed child care facilities had significant lead hazards   At facilities where the majority of children attending were African  American  30 percent were determined to pose serious risks of lead poisoning   A lack of enforcement  Nearly 12 million children under age 5 spend 40 hours a week in child care  An estimated 14 percent of licensed child care centers nationwide are contaminated with hazardous levels of lead based paint  according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development   A report by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified significant  systemic problems with the way in which the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  monitors and regulates the levels of lead in our nation s drinking water  including a complete lack of reliable data on which to make assessments and decisions  The GAO study found that few schools and child care facilities nationwide have tested their water for lead and no focal point exists at either the national or state level to collect and analyze test results  Few states have comprehensive programs to detect and remediate lead in drinking water at schools and child care facilities                                    ,1

D IL   Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Andre Carson  D IN  today sent a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Labor  Elaine Chao  asking for the release of National Emergency Grant funds to assist over 1 200 flight attendants and former employees of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines who recently lost their jobs of as a result of the abrupt termination in service    The members noted that it will be difficult for these working Americans to find new jobs as the airline industry continues to shrink    I am concerned that this troubled airline industry  which is facing massive layoffs and service shutdowns  will not be able to absorb the hard working flight attendants and airline personnel that have lost their jobs   said Durbin    We have come together on a bipartisan basis to see that the 1 200 workers   over 850 in Illinois   and their families have access to the resources they need to start again      With recent mass layoffs at ATA and Aloha Airlines  over a thousand workers are now without jobs   said Obama    These airlines collapsed in the face of skyrocketing fuel prices  a consolidating aviation industry  and a declining economy   I join Senator Durbin and Congressman Carson in calling on Secretary Chao to provide these workers with targeted assistance and emergency training grants   Families in Chicago  Indianapolis  and Honolulu need to know that their government is there when this kind of crisis hits  and I am committed to helping these families get the help they need    It is increasingly important that the U S  Department

and attached   April 25  2008 The Honorable Elaine L  Chao  U S  Department of Labor  200 Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20210 Dear Secretary Chao  The termination of operations of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines has resulted in the abrupt dislocation of over 1 200 flight attendants and other personnel  including customer service agents    Given the current state of the aviation industry  it will be difficult for these working Americans to find new jobs in the shrinking US airline industry   In the past  many dislocated or furloughed flight attendants found jobs with other carriers  but the job market in aviation today is poor  The Aloha and ATA flight attendants who are now unemployed had served more than 10 years on average in their specialized fields   The length of service with their company means that the vast majority of these flight attendants have not participated in the job market for more than a decade  A successful transition to a new career requires targeted dislocated worker intervention services   For these particular workers  and especially the flight attendants  whose unemployment follows years of wage and work rule concessions during bankruptcy for their carrier  we urge you to consider releasing National Emergency Grant funds to address their specific re training needs    We urge you to quickly evaluate whether the termination of operations of Aloha Airlines and ATA Airlines qualify as eligible events for National Emergency Grant  NEG  funding  and if so identify these flight attendants as a target population eligible for specialized assistance    If the flight attendants qualify  we further request that you issue a special guidance letter to all states and local workforce investment boards to announce the immediate availability of NEG funds and to encourage the development of expanded dislocated intervention services for these flight attendants   If they do not qualify  we request an explanation and alternative services that the Department can make available to them  We ask that you make this determination as quickly as possible and notify us as soon as that decision is made                                    Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date

                  Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the United States Senate passed by unanimous consent today a resolution condemning the violence and criminality by the Irish Republic Army and calling for peace in Northern Ireland   The resolution  sponsored by Senators Clinton  Kennedy  McCain  Dodd  Biden  Leahy and Lautenberg expressed support for the sisters of Robert McCartney in their pursuit of justice for the murder of their brother   The resolution calls upon the leadership of Sinn Fein to   insist that those responsible for the murder and witnesses to the murder cooperate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and be protected fully from any retaliation by the Irish Republican Army             I am pleased that the Senate quickly and unanimously approved this important resolution     Senator Clinton stated     Our government should offer full support and all appropriate assistance to law enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland to help make sure that the murderers of Robert McCartney are brought to justice           Senator Clinton reiterated her concerns about the murder of McCartney yesterday when she met with the McCartney sisters and again today when she met separately with Taoisearch Bertie Ahern and Geraldine Finucane whose husband  Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane  was murdered in 1989   Senator Clinton stressed that she believed that just as the investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane must be open  public and transparent  so too must the investigation into the murder of Robert McCartney             The Finucane family has been seeking justice and a truly independent  public inquiry and the British government must give them that public inquiry   I believe the McCartney sisters deserve an equally fair and independent inquiry into the murder of their brother   There is absolutely no justification for this senseless violence and justice demands a thorough public investigation    Senator Clinton said         The following is the text of the resolution        109TH CONGRESS  1ST SESSION  S  RES   ll         Condemning violence and criminality by the Irish Republican Army in  Northern Ireland        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  Mr  KENNEDY  for himself  Mr  MCCAIN  Mr  DODD  and Mrs  CLINTON  submitted the following resolution  which was referred to the Committee on  ___________       RESOLUTION Condemning violence and criminality by the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland  Whereas on January 30  2005  a Catholic citizen of Belfast  Northern Ireland  Robert McCartney  was brutally murdered by members of the Irish Republican Army  who attempted to cover up the crime and ordered all witnesses  to be silent about the involvement of Irish Republican  Army members        Whereas the sisters of Robert McCartney  Catherine McCartney  Paula Arnold  Gemma McMacken  Claire  McCartney  and Donna Mary McCartney  and his  fianc    e  Bridgeen Karen Hagans  refused to accept the  code of silence and have bravely challenged the Irish Republican Army by demanding justice for the murder of  Robert McCartney        Whereas when outcry over the murder increased  the Irish  Republican Army expelled 3 members  and 7 members of  Sinn Fein  the political wing of the Irish Republican  Army  were suspended from the party        Whereas the leadership of Sinn Fein has called for justice   but has not called on those responsible for the murder or any of those who witnessed the murder to cooperate directly with the Police Service of Northern Ireland        Whereas on March 8  2005  the Irish Republican Army  issued an outrageous statement in which it said it     was  willing to shoot the killers of Robert McCartney      and       Whereas peace and violence cannot coexist in Northern Ireland        Now  therefore  be it Resolved  That       1  The Senate joins the people of the United States in deploring and condemning violence and criminality by the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland  and     2  it is the sense of the Senate that       A  the sisters and fianc    e of Robert 7 McCartney deserve the full support of the  United States in their pursuit of justice      B  the leadership of Sinn Fein should insist that those responsible for the murder and witnesses to the murder cooperate directly with  the Police Service of Northern Ireland and be  protected fully from any retaliation by the Irish Republican Army  and    C  the Government of the United States  should offer all appropriate assistance to law  enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland to see that the murderers of Robert McCartney are brought to justice         ,0
1930,"DESPERATE TIMES FOR THE HUNGRY, HOMELESS, COLD
  Homeless shelters are running out of beds. Food banks have depleted their supplies. Many elderly and poor people are in danger of going cold in their homes because the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program is running out of funds to help pay record-high heating bills. And very many of these are working people! ""In other words, in Vermont and all over this country, a significant and growing number of our people are hungry, cold and homeless,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said at a press conference Thursday at his office in Burlington. ""There is a level of desperation not seen in many years."" 
   While the average working family has seen a decline in their real income during the years since George W. Bush took office, prices for everything from heating oil to child care are skyrocketing. Consider: 
   * The average price of heating oil in Vermont has more than doubled over the past seven years and is now $3.30 a gallon, 74 cents higher than last year alone. 
   * The average price of propane in Vermont has more than doubled over the past six years and is now $3.03 a gallon, 47 cents higher than last year. 
   * The average price of gas in Vermont is $3.12 a gallon, a 134 percent increase since January of 2001 and 88 cents higher than last year. 
   * The average health care premium for a typical Vermont family now costs $11,792 per year. 
   * The average cost of child care for two children in Vermont now costs almost $1,200 a month. 
   * The median price of a single family home in Vermont has increased by 97 percent over the last decade; and the price of rent for a modest two-bedroom apartment has increased by 42 percent over the past ten years. 
   * And, the price of college tuition at Vermont's four-year public colleges is up nearly 15 percent from seven years ago after adjusting for inflation to $9,582. 
   Making a bad situation worse, President Bush wants to significantly cut back on the resources available to the most desperate people in our society. 
   With the cost of home heating oil soaring, Bush wanted a $379 million cut in home heating assistance. Thankfully, Congress recently rejected this cut and provided $2.6 billion, a $400 million increase from last year. While that is a good start, much more needs to be done. First off, the president must stop delaying and immediately release the entirety of the LIHEAP contingency funds he has at his discretion. 
   As the affordable housing crisis expands, the president called for a major reduction in funding for elderly housing and housing for the disabled. While hunger in America grows, the president proposed eliminating Food Stamp assistance to 280,000 families. With more than nine million children lacking health insurance, he vetoed legislation that would expand the Children's Health Insurance Program. He even tried to eliminate the Community Services Block Grant Program that provides desperately-needed emergency services for the lowest income people.
   ""This is clearly unacceptable,"" Sanders said. ""As soon as the Senate reconvenes later this month, I will be playing a very active role to provide solutions to these very serious problems. First, I will be leading the fight to increase home heating assistance by $800 million. In the richest country on the face of the earth, we must do all that we can to ensure that no-one goes cold this winter.
   ""I will work with Senator Sherrod Brown to pass an extra $40 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program to make sure that food banks in Vermont and throughout the country have the food they need so that no-one goes hungry this winter. I will work with Senator Patrick Leahy to secure the enactment of the Farm Bill which would provide an extra $6 million in nutrition assistance to Vermonters through an increase in the Food Stamp program and federal assistance to Vermont's Food Banks. And I will work with Senator John Kerry to pass the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act to provide the resources necessary to build at least 1.5 million affordable housing rental units over the next decade while creating 1.8 million new jobs in the process.
   Sanders continued, ""Finally, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I will be working to reshape our national priorities to reduce poverty, expand the middle class, and shrink the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor. 
   ""It is a moral disgrace that 37 million Americans are living in poverty; 47 million Americans have no health insurance; and 35.5 million Americans have trouble putting food on the table. We have got to do better than that.""

1797,"EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE
  Thousands of workers took part at a Capitol Hill rally in support of legislation to create an easier path for workers to win union representation. ""Since the formation of our nation more than 200 years ago, working people have led the fight to improve the quality of life for all Americans, and that is what the Employee Free Choice Act is all about,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders told the crowd. 
  When only the wealthy were allowed to vote, workers were successful in their demand for universal suffrage and a more democratic society. When tiny children were forced to work in the factories and fields, it was the working people of our country who put an end to abusive child labor and who fought for quality public education. When bosses refused to negotiate with their employees and fired them for standing up for their rights, workers pushed Congress into passing legislation which guaranteed all people the right to organize unions. 
  The list goes on and on. Social Security, the minimum wage, the eight-hour day, Medicare and Medicaid, affordable housing - are just a few of the victories that workers have won over the years thanks in large part to the union movement. But, despite all the hard-earned victories won by working people in the past, the struggle continues.
  The fact of the matter is there is a war going on in America today. And, I'm not talking about the War in Iraq or the War in Afghanistan. I'm talking about a war against the American middle class, the American standard of living, and indeed the American dream itself.
  And, just like the War in Iraq, when it comes to the economy, the President and those in his Administration are simply not telling the truth.
  Since George W. Bush became President, a record number of billionaires have been created, while median income for working-age families has declined each and every year; 3 million good-paying manufacturing jobs have been lost; median household debt has skyrocketed; and, home foreclosures are at their highest level in 50 years. 
  The truth is workers today are often working longer hours for lower wages than they did 25 years ago. 
  What can we do about all of this?
  First, we must pass the Employee Free Choice Act to make it easier for workers to join unions. Union workers make about 30 percent more than non-union employees. Union workers are much more likely to have a decent pension and health care benefits than non-union workers. Clearly, this is something that is vitally important to restoring the middle class in the United States today.
  We must also end our disastrous unfettered free trade policy which is basically telling corporate America: leave the United States of America, go to China, go to Mexico, go to some desperate Third World country where people are paid pennies an hour. That is what our trade policy encourages them to do, and that is what we have got to change. 
  The reality is that NAFTA has failed, our membership in the World Trade Organization has failed, and perhaps, above all, Permanent Normal Trade relations with China has failed.
  In addition, when we talk about strengthening the middle class, we have got to talk about how our healthcare system is disintegrating. Since the president has been in office, nearly 7 million Americans have lost their health insurance and millions more are under-insured. 
  We have got to make healthcare a right of citizenship for every man, woman and child in this country by enacting a national, universal healthcare program.
  Working together, we can once again expand the middle class in this country and keep the American Dream alive for our children and grandchildren. That is what America is supposed to be about. I look forward to working with all of you to make this a reality.

 Senator Obama sat on the Conference Committee that won these improvements in the bill  Below is a statement by Senator Obama   The first bill I introduced as a Senator was to make college more affordable for every American  and the bill we passed today is an important step toward achieving that goal     Senator Obama said      In a global economy where countries who out educate us will out compete us tomorrow  we must make a college education available and affordable for every American  and that means doing more to invest in programs that work and expanding them to more students   We must also end wasteful  high priced loans from private lenders and use the savings to help more students go to college   By investing in education we are restoring America s competitiveness in the world  and today is an important step forward  I want to thank Senator Kennedy for his continued leadership on this issue    As a member of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  Obama also worked to secure an increase of  100 million in college aid for Illinois students in 2008 2009  and a projected  850 million over the next several years  This increased student aid is mostly in the form of Pell Grants  This is paid for not by increasing the deficit  but by reductions in government subsidies to banks and other lenders  This is similar to the provisions of the HOPE Act  the first bill Senator Obama introduced in the Senate in 2005  THE COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act Will Provide Over  20 Billion in New Student Aid and Benefits     The Largest Increase in Funding Since the GI Bill  According to a recent report on education statistics  twenty years ago  the maximum Pell Grant covered 51 percent of the cost of tuition  fees  room and board at a public four year college  In the 2005 2006 school year  the maximum Pell Grant covered roughly a third of these costs  Democrats have worked to rectify this decline in the purchasing power of the Pell Grant  Under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act  the maximum Pell Grant will be increased by  500 next year to  4800 and to  5 400 by 2012   Analysis of Department

782,August 11  2007 Clinton Calls on President Bush   Defense Secretary Gates to Clarify Administration Policy on Resuming the Military Draft  and Affirm Their Commitment to an All volunteer Force                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Comes in Light of White House Official Declaring that the Draft is  an option on the table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President George Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates to clarify the Administration s position on re instituting the military draft  in light of White House Deputy National Security Adviser Lt  Gen  Douglas Lute saying yesterday that the draft has always been an option on the table   which contradicts previously stated Administration policy    Our volunteer military  is the best in the world and has been performing heroically under difficult circumstances  Clinton said  While our force is under strain  a draft is not the answer   I call upon President Bush and Secretary Gates to clarify Gen  Lute s remarks and affirm their commitment to the all volunteer force   Rather than raising the specter of a draft  the Administration should be focusing on providing our current servicemembers with the equipment and benefits they need and deserve    Since 1973  the United States has relied on an all volunteer force    As recently as December of last year  when the Selective Service System underwent a comprehensive Readiness test  the White House reiterated its position opposing re instituting the draft    General Lute though  tasked with coordinating White House policy on the wars in Iraq  Afghanistan  has now cast that opposition in doubt by saying that a military draft is an option on the table  and the President and Secretary of Defense need to clarify his remarks  and clearly state the current position of the Administration         ,0
1146,September 14  2005 Key Senate Panel Acts to Make College More Affordable and Accessible Legislation Includes Much of Senator Clinton  s Non Traditional Student Success Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Legislation to help make college more affordable and accessible to thousands of New York students passed a major hurdle last week after winning approval by the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  on which Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton serves            Many students are drowning under the debt of their student loans and it is limiting their life and career choices   This bill increases need based grant aid by  5 5 billion and takes some important steps to reign in the cost of college     said Senator Clinton            Specifically  the bill increases financial aid for students by raising the maximum authorized Pell Grant to  5100 in the 2006 2007 school year   providing 417 000 New York students with a total of  1 35 billion in need based grants   Low income students who study math and science will also be eligible for additional financial aid     1 billion in total    as an incentive to enhance our competitiveness in these critical fields where we are currently lagging behind our global partners            The bill also strengthens the Direct Loan program  which is dramatically more cost efficient than the government guaranteed program   According to the Bush Administration  s Office of Management and Budget  government guaranteed loans cost taxpayers about 12 cents on the dollar  while direct loans cost less than a penny on the dollar   Under this bill  those with Direct Loans who enter public service will be able to opt for an income repayment plan that dismisses their outstanding loans after ten years of service   Students will also retain their ability to consolidate their loans at a low fixed rate          Additionally  the bill creates more accountability for rising college costs by requiring the Department of Education to annually publish and rank the cost of a full time undergraduate education at each college in the country  as well as the average cost over the last ten years   The bill also requires the Department of Education to create a higher education cost index so students will have an independent barometer against which they can evaluate increases in the cost of college  And it authorizes the first comprehensive study of the factors contributing to rising tuition  and the most effective ways to reign in college costs in          Your average student graduates with equivalent of one full mortgage in student debt     said Senator Clinton    While we need to do more to help students afford college  this bill is a big step forward           The committee approved bill also includes a number of provisions from Senator Clinton  s Non Traditional Student Success Act  which will make college more accessible and affordable for students who are older  working full or part time  have children  and are the first in their families to go to college          These provisions include          Providing financial aid to less than half time students   Currently only 6  of less than half time students receive any form of financial aid because they are completely ineligible for most aid  including federal loans    Making Pell Grants available year round  Currently  students can only receive Pell Grants during the 9 month school year  making it hard for non traditional students to complete school in a timely fashion  This provision is likely to reduce the drop out rate among non traditional students because they will not be forced to take time off    Permitting colleges to create innovative class schedules  such as 8 hour classes on weekends or in the evenings that are more accessible for working students   Current law only allows students to receive financial aid if their classes extend over 15 weeks    A targeted new program aimed at reducing the college drop out rate among disadvantaged students   The bill authorizes a new program that helps students who did not receive a good high school education to get up to speed academically and graduate  The program encourages colleges to create articulation agreements so that students at two year schools can transfer seamlessly to four year schools      Ending the work penalty   Current law penalizes students who work by lowering the amount they can receive in student aid   This bill allows students to keep more of their earnings  which will help students who are forced to work in order to care for their families             Each of these provisions will help students at schools all across New York such as Adirondack Community College  which has developed a medical device manufacturing training program that is 10 to 12 weeks long  or the Medgar Evers College Certified Nurse Assistant program  which is part of a new biotech career pathway in Brooklyn               Together  these policies will help make New York  s workforce more adaptable and competitive     said Senator Clinton     Some individuals who have lost their jobs due to outsourcing need retraining     said Senator Clinton     This bill offers a real second chance for people who want to finish college              On average  those who complete college earn  1 million more over their lifetime than those who stop their education after high school  according to the College Board   Senator Clinton is a strong supporter of increasing investments in higher education so that every student can go to college if they so choose               ,0

1897,"SENATE APPROVES IRAQ WITHDRAWAL, SENS. SANDERS, LEAHY ASK BUSH TO RECONSIDER VETO THREAT
  As the Senate for the first time approved legislation setting a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, Vermont Sens. Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy called on President Bush to withdraw his threat to veto the bill.  
   The Iraq withdrawal timetable is part of a $121 billion supplemental spending bill for Iraq, Afghanistan, Darfur and other issues. President Bush Wednesday repeated his intention to veto any legislation that includes a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. The House last week passed a similar bill, and the two versions will now be reconciled in conference. 
   ""I hope the president changes his mind about vetoing this legislation,"" said Sanders. ""The war has dragged on for too long, and we've got to bring home our troops. The Iraqi people must take responsibility for their own future."" 
   ""The new Congress has offered a way out of Iraq, while the White House seems intent on digging us deeper into this civil war,"" said Leahy. ""A veto would only add to the multitude of mistakes President Bush has made in this war and delay getting resources to our troops in the field. I hope he will reconsider."" 
   The Iraq redeployment language in the bill would require the president to begin a phased withdrawal of U.S. forces within the next four months. The redeployment of U.S. troops would be targeted for completion by this time next year, leaving only a residual force necessary to protect American diplomatic personnel, undertake Iraqi troop training, and carry out residual counterterrorism operations. The House last week passed related legislation, and the president has said he would veto any legislation containing a date for withdrawal.

31,   Durbin  Obama Call on State Department to Publicly Ask France to Follow American Example of Cooperation on Noreiga   s  Extradition and Extradite Hans Peterson Immediately   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Durbin  Obama Call on State Department to Publicly Ask France to Follow American Example of Cooperation on Noreiga   s  Extradition and Extradite Hans Peterson Immediately Tuesday  September 11  2007  For Immediate Release Contact   Christina Mulka  Durbin  or Amy Brundage  Obama    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urging her to consider  in light of the State Department   s support for France   s extradition request for Manuel Noriega  to publicly request that the Government of France extradite Hans Peterson  an American citizen who reportedly confessed to the 2006 murder of Dr  David Cornbleet in Chicago     In today   s letter  the Senators note that     The State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States  We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet          Earlier this month  Peterson turned himself in to French authorities in St  Martin and reportedly confessed to the brutal murder of Dr  Cornbleet  a Chicago dermatologist   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   According to reports  Peterson  whose mother is French  fled to French territory after committing the murder in an effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States   The U S  Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for Peterson   s extradition     On August 23  France announced its decision not to extradite Peterson  While the extradition treaty between the United States and France says that there is    no obligation upon the requested state to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the requested state     this treaty does not preclude France from exercising its discretion to extradite one of its nationals to the U S       Last week  Durbin met with the newly appointed French Ambassador  Pierre Vimont  and the French Charg   d   Affaires  Fran  ois Rivasseau  to urge France to reconsider its decision not to extradite Hans Peterson   On August 27  Durbin and Senator Obama sent a letter to the French Foreign Minister  Bernard Kouchner  urging France to reconsider its decision    On August 20  Durbin and Obama sent a letter to Charg   d   Affaires Rivasseau at the French Embassy in Washington  DC  urging the Government of France to agree to the United States    request for Peterson   s extradition to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   The Illinois Senators also sent a letter on August 20 to Secretary of State Rice  requesting that she immediately urge her French counterparts to examine the extradition request and to advise the U S  Embassy in Paris of the importance of this case    text of the letter is below    September 11  2007 Dr  Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  U S  Department of State  2201 C Street NW  Washington  DC 20520 Madam Secretary   We write to seek your urgent assistance with regard to the pending extradition request in the case of murdered Illinois doctor David Cornbleet   This letter follows up on our letter to you of August 20  to which we have not yet received a response   In light of the time  sensitive nature of this matter  we request that you respond to this letter as soon as possible and no later than one week from today      Dr  Cornbleet  a respected and beloved doctor from Chicago  was brutally stabbed to death on October 24  2006   In August 2007  Hans Peterson  an American citizen with dual French nationality  turned himself in to French authorities in the French West Indies and confessed to Dr  Cornbleet   s murder   Peterson is currently in French custody in Guadeloupe   The United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs has issued a formal request to the Government of France for the extradition of Peterson to face criminal prosecution for Dr  Cornbleet s murder  and we have contacted you and the French government to express our strong support for that request    However  the French government has said that France will not extradite Peterson  and that Peterson will be tried under the French justice system    We note that the State Department has publicly expressed support for France   s request for former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to be extradited from the United States to France to face money laundering charges   While there are certainly compelling reasons for Noriega to face justice in France  there are also compelling reasons for Hans Peterson to face justice in the United States   We therefore ask that the State Department immediately make a direct appeal to the Government of France to extradite Hans Peterson to face charges in Cook County  Illinois for the murder of Dr  Cornbleet    We believe the specific facts of this case justify Peterson   s extradition to the United States   Dr  Cornbleet s murder was unspeakable in its brutality  and Dr  Cornbleet s family  the people of Illinois  and the United States criminal justice system have a strong and compelling interest in seeing Dr  Cornbleet   s confessed murderer face trial in the United States   Hans Peterson was born in Oregon in 1978  and for the first 28 years of his life he lived in the United States and availed himself of the rights and privileges of U S  citizenship   Only after allegedly committing a heinous crime did Peterson flee the United States for French territory and seek the rights and privileges of French nationality in an attempt to escape criminal prosecution in the United States   There is legitimate concern that Peterson  if found guilty of murder in France  would serve a lesser sentence than he might be expected to serve if tried and convicted in the United States       The French ambassador has verbally indicated to us that Peterson cannot be extradited because French law prohibits the extradition of its nationals   However  Article 3 of the recent Extradition Treaty between the United States and France does not preclude France from extraditing one of its nationals to the United States   Moreover  the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France states that it was concluded in order    to provide for more effective cooperation between the two States in the suppression of crime and to facilitate relations between the two States in the area of extradition         That cooperation appears imminent in the case of Manuel Noriega  and would also be appropriate in the case of Hans Peterson   We have asked the Government of France to provide us with a written analysis reconciling its legal position with the plain language of the Extradition Treaty   To date  we have not received that written analysis    To the extent the Government of France has any discretion available under French law and international treaties to extradite Hans Peterson to the United States  we ask that the Government of the United States  through the State Department  urge the French government to exercise that discretion in favor of extradition    We thank you in advance for the consideration of this request  and we again request that you reply to this letter as soon as possible  and in no case later than September 18     Sincerely   Richard J  Durbin                                                            United States Senator

1972,"EARTH TO PRESIDENT BUSH: THE MIDDLE CLASS IS SHRINKING
  The latest claims by President Bush about ""our thriving economy"" are further evidence that he is totally out of touch with the realities facing America's shrinking middle class. ""What planet is he living on? Senator Bernie Sanders asked.
   ""I am sick and tired of the president telling us how great the economy is when every working American knows that is not true,"" Sanders said. ""The millionaires and billionaires he showered with special tax breaks may be making out alright, but the Bush economy has been a disaster for everyone else.""
   The president's comments came Wednesday at the conclusion of a meeting with economic advisors at the U.S. Department of Treasury. Sanders was in Rutland, Vt., for the second in a week-long series of meetings on jobs and public works needs in economically hard-pressed communities. 
   ""While the president tells us how the economy is 'thriving,' the American people understand how wrong he is,"" Sanders added. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, he noted, found that more than two-thirds of Americans believe the U.S. economy is either in recession now or will be in the next year.
   Since the president took office, Sanders added, 5.4 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty; nearly seven million Americans have lost their health insurance; median household income has gone down by nearly $1,300; three million manufacturing jobs have been lost; the real earnings of college graduates have gone down by about 5 percent; entry level wages for male and female high school graduates have fallen by 3.3 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively; and three million American workers have lost their pensions.
   Home foreclosures are now the highest on record; the personal savings rate is lower than at any time since before the Great Depression; wages and salaries are at the lowest share of gross domestic product since 1929; and the top 300,000 Americans now earn nearly as much income as the bottom 150 million Americans combined.
   A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders has cited the president's disconnect with economic reality in opposing confirmation of former Rep. Jim Nussle to be the White House budget director. The Senate has scheduled three hours of debate on the Nussle nomination as the first order of business when Congress reconvenes on September 4.
   At the Treasury Department meeting, Bush touted his management of the economy and made false claims about the how Congress has handled the budget. The fact is under President Bush, job growth has been far below historic standards, unemployment has been higher than when he took office and workers are being squeezed as wages have not kept up with costs. Bush also has turned record surpluses into record deficits, increasing debt by $3 trillion and allowing runaway spending.
   Here is more from the Joint Economic Committee:
   Middle Class Squeeze
   Real Earnings Growth Since 2000 Has Been Much Weaker And More Unequal Compared With The Late 1990s. The typical worker's real (inflation-adjusted) weekly earnings fell by 0.4 percent between 2000 and 2006, compared with a gain of 7.2 percent between 1994 and 2000. Moreover, while it was weak overall, earnings growth between 2000 and 2006 was faster for those in the upper half of the income distribution than it was for those in the lower half, and earnings for those at the very bottom declined. In contrast, growth during the second half of the 1990s was uniformly strong across the wage distribution.
   Real Household Income Has Declined For All Income Groups Since 2000. After adjusting for inflation, the income of a typical household fell by almost $1,300, or 2.7 percent, between 2000 and 2005, the latest year for which we have data. Households in the poorest fifth of the income distribution have experienced the greatest declines (7.5 percent), while those at the top experienced the smallest declines (1.0 percent).
   Despite Strong Productivity Gains, Real Hourly Compensation Growth is Lagging. Historically, economy-wide increases in workers' pay have tended to track economy-wide increases in productivity (output per hour). However, while productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose by 17.8 percent between the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2007, real (inflation-adjusted) average hourly compensation (wages plus benefits) increased by only 9.8 percent over the same period.
   Explosive Health Care Costs Are Squeezing Family Incomes. Between 2005 and 2006, health insurance premiums rose at more than twice the rate of workers' earnings. Between 2000 and 2006, the average monthly premium paid by workers with health coverage rose 57 percent.
   Rising Energy Costs Are Eating Into Families' Budgets. The price of gasoline has more than doubled since July 2001, when the average gallon of regular grade gas cost $1.42. Six years later, in July 2007, that same gallon of gasoline cost $2.97, reaching a high of $3.22 the week of May 21.
   College Tuition Growth Continues To Outpace Inflation. Over the past several years, tuition has risen at more than double the rate of inflation. Between the 2000-01 and 2005-06 academic years, average public college tuition and fees increased by 40 percent--the fastest rate of growth over any five-year period since the 1970s. Nearly two-thirds of college students graduate with debt, with the typical debt load approaching $20,000.
   Jobs and Unemployment
   President Bush Is Tied for the Worst Jobs Creation Record of Any President in the Past 70 years. President Bush is in a statistical dead heat with his father for the worst job creation record of any President since Herbert Hoover, with just 5.7 million more total jobs (nonfarm private sector and government payrolls) than there were when he took office in January 2001. That is a paltry job creation pace of just 72,000 total jobs per month.
   Manufacturing Payrolls Have Declined By Over 3 Million Jobs Since President Bush Took Office. Manufacturing has been particularly hard hit, with payrolls declining by over 3.1 million jobs between January 2001 and July 2007.
   Unemployment Rate Remains Higher than When President Bush Took Office. July's unemployment rate of 4.6 percent, though down from its peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003, is higher than the historic lows achieved in the late 1990s.
   Long-term Unemployment Remains High. The number of people unemployed for more than 26 weeks is 93 percent higher than it was when President Bush took office. In July 2007, nearly one in five of the unemployed (18.4 percent) has been unemployed for more than 26 weeks.
   Economic Growth
   The Current Economic Expansion is the Slowest of the Postwar Period. In the 25 quarters since the first quarter of 2001, the overall economy has grown at a 2.5 percent average annual rate. That is the slowest growth of any expansion in the postwar period. While the economy grew at a 3.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year, that was largely a rebound from its anemic 0.6 advance in the first quarter.
   Sub-Par Growth Expected to Continue Through This Year and Next. Leading economic forecasters expect economic growth to slow from its second-quarter pace in the current and coming quarters. The Federal Reserve, for example, believes it likely that economic growth will be less than 3 percent in the second half of this year and continue to lag through the first half of next year.
   Debt and Deficits
   The Budget Would Be In Surplus If Not for the Deficit-Financed Bush Tax Cuts. The CBO's recent analysis confirms that without the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (EGTRRA and JGTRRA), the budget would be in surplus this year. That holds even when accounting for any ""dynamic"" effects of the tax cuts on the economy, which the CBO says ""have largely dissipated by now"" and are ""probably small."" The CBO estimates that the cost of the tax cuts in 2007 alone, including debt service, is $211 billion, and even with ""dynamic"" offset is at least $195 billion. (The CBO's latest projection of the 2007 deficit - to be updated later this month - is $177 billion.)
   Low National Saving Is Partly Responsible For A Weak Economy. The weakness in the economy in large part stems from the lack of adequate national saving. Experts have testified at recent hearings that the decline in national saving since 2001 has been driven in large part by the record budget deficits. A projected $5.6 trillion budget surplus has turned into a $2.4 trillion deficit - a dramatic $8.0 trillion deterioration. The dependence of economic growth on national saving, and of national saving on public saving, is one of the most important reasons why deficits do matter.

1822,"SEN. SANDERS BLASTS BUSH ASSAULT ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH
  Senator Bernie Sanders condemned as ""sick"" a new Bush administration executive order imposing restrictions on a popular children's health insurance program. 
   The new rules will thwart efforts by Vermont and other states to expand health care and could leave some 2,000 Vermont children who are currently enrolled without coverage.
   ""It is outrageous that President Bush is slamming the doctors' office door on sick children,"" said Sanders, a member of the Senate health committee. 
   ""We are the only major nation which does not provide health insurance for all children. Instead of throwing kids off health care, Bush should be working with us to cover more kids,"" Sanders added. ""Frankly, even for the Bush administration this is a new low. While he pushes for billions in tax breaks for the richest 1 percent, he is throwing kids off of the health insurance they already have. What a set of priorities!"" 
   In a letter to state health officials, the Bush administration outlined new federal rules that limit access to the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Sanders said the new eligibility restrictions could be especially devastating in Vermont. About 2,000 of the 3,000 children enrolled in the Dr. Dinosaur program could lose coverage or the state would have to pay the entire amount for their insurance.
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid.

1775,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF VA SECRETARY NICHOLSON
  Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, issued the following statement on the resignation of Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson: 
   ""The veterans secretary is one of the most important jobs in our government, especially during a time of war. In selecting a new secretary, I hope President Bush chooses someone who can handle the enormous challenges facing the department. 
   ""Veterans in this country and their families need an advocate, not an adversary. They need someone committed to ending the waiting lines for health care and other services in Vermont and across this country, someone committed to opening the doors of the VA to all veterans, and someone who will make sure that service members returning from combat and their families get the care they deserve.
   ""As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I will look very closely at the president's nominee to replace Secretary Nicholson to make sure that these qualifications are met and that the nominee is ready to work with America's veterans and members of Congress to improve the care that the Department of Veterans Affairs provides.""

1794,"STOP THE WAR
  Over the opposition of Bernie Sanders and two dozen other senators, the Senate late Tuesday voted to provide another $70 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""I cannot support providing more money for continuing our ill-conceived and tragic presence in Iraq with no requirement for when our redeployment will begin, when it will be concluded, and what our future course in Iraq will be,"" Sanders said. ""This war has been a disaster from day one. It is time to bring our troops home."" The vote came after the Senate rejected a proposal cosponsored by Sanders to bring troops home from Iraq by next May. The amendment by Sen. Russ Feingold was defeated 71 to 24. 
   The House of Representatives on Wednesday was expected to seal the deal between Democratic congressional leaders and Bush by giving final approval of the war funds and a spending package for federal agencies. 
   ""The war spending legislation contains $40 billion for Iraq operations with no strings attached to be used as President Bush wishes with no accountability for when our involvement in Iraq will end,"" Sanders said. ""With expenditures of $12 billion a month, it is now estimated that the total cost of our Iraq involvement will end up being more than $1 trillion.""

Menendez  D  N J   sent a letter to the heads of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  and the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to call for the creation of a joint task force to examine the recent E  coli outbreaks in New Jersey  New York  Delaware  South Carolina and Utah   The task force would report to Congress and the public on the cause of these incidents and recommend changes in laws and regulations to protect American  s food and health            We urge your agencies to convene a multi agency task force and develop recommendations on how to effectively address the problem of foodborne illness associated with fresh produce   These latest incidents illustrate that we need to do more to reduce the risk of food borne illness in our country   At greatest risk are older Americans  children  pregnant women  and those with weakened immune systems     the Senators wrote   The letter is addressed to FDA Commissioner Andrew C  von Eschenbach  CDC Director Julie Gerberding  and Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns            Since early December  at least 169 people have been sickened by E  Coli after eating at restaurants affiliated with the same fast food chain   There is strong evidence that this outbreak can be linked to produce used in these restaurants   Earlier this year  E  coli contaminated spinach killed at least 3 people and sickened more than 200            Produce has also been linked to previous foodborne disease outbreaks   In 2004  an outbreak of Hepatitis A was traced to lettuce and tomatoes in California   The outbreak made 14 people ill   In 2003  an outbreak of Hepatitis A in Pennsylvania was traced to green onions from a Chi Chi  s restaurant   The outbreak killed 4 people and sickened 600          A copy of the full letter is attached to this release     December 12  2006      The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary of Agriculture  U S

are writing to urge your agencies to immediately form a joint task force on the recent E  coli outbreaks  and that this task force report to Congress and the public on the cause of these incidents and what changes in law and regulation are needed to prevent future problems          As you are aware  since early December  at least 169 people in New Jersey  New York  Delaware  South Carolina and Utah have been sickened  by E  coli 0157 H7  a deadly and aggressive strain of the bacteria   Most of these people ate at restaurants affiliated with the same fast food chain   There is strong evidence that this outbreak can be traced to produce used in these restaurants            We urge your agencies to convene a multi agency task force and develop recommendations on how to effectively address the problem of foodborne illness associated with fresh produce   We would welcome your recommendations on what changes in law may need to be made by Congress  and what steps can be taken at the agency level   We would strongly encourage the task force to take into consideration the views of appropriate interested parties  such as small farmers and other growers  food safety consumer groups  industry representatives  and state agencies                The latest outbreak is not the first time that fresh produce has been linked to a foodborne disease outbreak  in 2003  an outbreak of Hepatitis A in Pennsylvania  which killed 4 people and sickened 600  was traced to green onions from a Chi Chi  s restaurant   Earlier this year  E  coli contaminated spinach killed at least 3 people and sickened over 200   While the FDA has issued voluntary food safety guidance to the produce industry over the years  these recent outbreaks indicate that this voluntary approach may be insufficient to protect the public     According to USDA  s Economic Research Service  hazards in food cause an estimated 76 million illnesses  325 000 hospitalizations  and 5 000 deaths in the United States each year  this is most likely an underestimation as many occurrences of foodborne illness are never reported to public health officials   At greatest risk are older Americans  children  pregnant women  and those with weakened immune systems   These latest incidents illustrate that we need to do more to reduce the risk of food borne illness in our country          Thank you for your consideration of this request           Sincerely       Frank R  Lautenberg  Richard Durbin  Charles E  Schumer  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Robert Menendez         ,0
1929,"CONGRESS RETURNS
  Congress returns this week to take up a long to-do list that includes financing nearly every federal agency, and dealing with major questions on surveillance, the farm bill, Pentagon spending and energy policy. The energy bill would increase fuel economy standards for the first time in more than a decade. A critical Senate comittee vote on global warming is set for later in the week. Meanwhile, as the season's first major storm blanketed Vermont with several inches of snow and temperatures were forecast to dip into single digits, Senator Bernie Sanders planned on Tuesday to introduce legislation to provide $1 billion for home heating assistance.

1926,"PLAINFIELD COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER BECOMES SIXTH IN VERMONT TO BE DESIGNATED FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER
  The Plainfield Community Health Center has become the sixth in Vermont to be designated a federally qualified health center. The center was awarded $566,667 in the first of what will be annual grants for its program of preventative and primary health care services. ""Community health centers are providing high-quality health care, low-cost prescription drugs, dental care, and mental health counseling in a very cost-effective way,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders said.  
   The Plainfield Health Center director, Dr. John Matthew said, ""Being designated an FQHC and receiving the funding will strengthen our health care programs for all of our current patients and for new patients from our service area. It will allow us to offer social services, outreach, screening, education and other programs that we could not provide before. The designation also helps underwrite our sliding fee scale for uninsured, low-income individuals.""
   The Health Center in Washington County was among 86 to be awarded a total of $45 million in nationwide grants under the program established by Congress in the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.
   In Vermont, the addition of the Plainfield center brings to six the number of federally-funded health center networks. Altogether, the centers care for patients in eight counties, serving more than 10 percent of the state population. In the long term, Sanders hopes to establish health centers throughout Vermont.
   The funding that The Health Center in Plainfield will receive is a direct result of an increase Sanders helped secure in appropriations for this year. Part of a resolution Congress passed to fund all government agencies in 2007, community health centers received an increase of $207 million.
   In addition, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee Sanders added $575 million more than President Bush sought for health centers in Vermont and across the country for next year. The extra funds were authorized in a budget resolution Congress approved on May 17. If Congress appropriates all of the funds that were budgeted, new health centers could be created to serve 4 million more Americans. In addition, the funding would provide the first increase in grants in two years for existing health centers that have been treating an increasing number of uninsured patients.
   Separate legislation introduced by Sanders on March 20 would strengthen support for 1,200 existing community health centers that serve more than 15 million patients regardless of their ability to pay, and devote additional resources to another 800 centers already approved on paper but unfunded because of budget shortfalls.
   In addition, Sanders' bill would double the funding for the National Health Service Corps in order to train and send more primary care doctors and dentists into rural and inner-city communities where 35 million Americans live without full access to basic medical services.

723,December 10  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on President Bush to Address Delays in Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit Determinations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today sent the following letter to President Bush urging him to address delays in benefit determinations affecting hundreds of thousands of applicants for Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI     December 10  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    Over the last several years  I have called for adequate funding for the Social Security Administration and the critical work they perform  including eligibility determinations for the Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI  program   Currently it can take as long as four years for an applicant for disability benefits to have his or her application approved   In fact  wait times for those seeking an appeal from their initial benefit determination have shot up from 250 days in 2000 to more than 500 days in 2007   Since 2000  SSDI backlogs have soared  from more than 300 000 to more than 750 000 cases awaiting an appeals hearing   Backlogs for initial claims are greater than 575 000 cases  During these extended waiting periods  many of these disabled applicants have no earnings  placing significant financial strain on them and their families         Recent news reports regarding these backlogs and unacceptably long wait times for applicants only reinforce the grave need to address this problem   The heartbreaking stories of individuals losing their homes  falling into bankruptcy and even dying before receiving a benefit determination should compel us to action  Unfortunately  your recent veto of  275 million in additional funding for the SSA as part of the Labor HHS appropriations bill signals an unacceptable willingness on the part of your Administration to let this problem continue to grow  Even your current Social Security Commissioner acknowledges that increasing the number of judges to hear these appeals to 1 200 would require at least  100 million beyond your FY 2008 budget request      These families and their grave needs should not be held hostage by continued veto threats  Last week  I joined a number of my colleagues in a letter to Senate appropriators urging them to include an increase in funding equal to the one included in the bill you vetoed   I urge you to reconsider your veto threat and make it immediately clear that you support the needed funding increase for SSA and will sign into law the appropriations legislation that Congress is currently drafting   These delays are an unconscionable burden on too many American families  and I hope you will act in their interest to clear the backlog in the SSDI program  Sincerely  Hillary Rodham Clinton        ,0

222,   Obama Statement on Iraq   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Statement on Iraq Wednesday  January 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 17  2007  Obama Statement on Iraq    Throughout the war in Iraq  we have been given assurance after assurance by our government only to find out that facts on the ground reflect a completely different reality       Last week  after being told by President Bush that his plan to escalate this war would be well planned  well coordinated  and well supported by the Iraqi government  we find out in this week s New York Times that none of this is true   Military officials tell us that there is no clear chain of command between Iraqis and U S  commanders and no real indication that the Iraqis even want such a partnership       I cannot in good conscience support this plan   As I first said two months ago  we should not be sending more U S  troops to Iraq  we should begin redeploying them to let the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever and to pressure the Sunnis  Shiites  and Kurds to finally reach a political settlement     Escalation is a failed policy opposed by generals  Democrats and Republicans  and now even the Iraqis themselves  and the fact that the President is already moving ahead with this idea is a terrible consequence of the decision to give him the broad  open ended authority to wage this war in 2002     It now falls on Congress to find a way to support our troops in the field while still preventing the President from multiplying his previous mistakes   That is why I not only favor capping the number U S  troops in Iraq  but believe it s imperative that we begin the phased redeployment I called for two months ago  and intend to introduce legislation that does just that                                      ,1

                     Four Point Plan Includes  2 45 Billion for Programs to Help Protect Long Island Beaches  Reduce Ocean Pollution  and Clean Up Long Island Sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Babylon  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was joined by Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy  Babylon Supervisor Steve Bellone and the Natural Resources Defense Council today in announcing a four point plan to protect Long Island beaches  reduce ocean pollution  and clean up Long Island Sound           The plan  called   Save Our Shores     was announced at an event organized by Supervisor Bellone  where local children planted beach grass to control erosion at Overlook Beach             Long Island  s beaches are an economic engine for Long Island  and we need to be doing more to protect them and clean up the ocean     said Senator Clinton     My plan to   Save Our Shores    would provide nearly  2 5 billion in funding to help protect the shoreline  reduce pollution in the ocean and Long Island Sound  and combat the spread of harmful invasive species               Senator Clinton s proposal to provide federal funding for support of storm water runoff remediation projects will give a significant boost to our efforts to improve the quality of the water which surrounds our Island     said Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy    With the support of the public  Suffolk has invested heavily in preserving land around our significant waterways  in restoring the once abundant shell fish populations and in addressing the environmental problems caused by storm water runoff   The Senator s proposal will bolster Suffolk s aggressive programs to curb storm water runoff     Levy added            I applaud Senator Clinton for proposing this important legislation     said Babylon Town Supervisor Steve Bellone     Our coastal resources are a critical component of our economy and quality of life and their protection must be a top priority               The U S  set a new record of 20 000 beach closings and advisories due to unsafe bacteria pollution last year  more than 800 in New York alone     said Lisa Speer  Director of the Water and Oceans program at the Natural Resources Defense Council     People are getting sick and families are stuck standing on the shore because local communities haven t been getting the federal support they need to fix overloaded sewage systems or deal with contaminated runoff             The   Save Our Shores    plan has four points          1  Clean Up Coastal Waters   Senator Clinton announced today that she will be introducing the   Clean Coast Act      The bill would create a 5 year   1 5 billion U S  Environmental Protection Agency program to help communities in New York and across the country to attack the most pressing coastal water quality problems  such as combined sewer overflows  polluted storm water  and pollution from   non point    sources such as fertilizer and pesticides from lawns   The funding would be available to states  localities and non profit organizations through a competitive grant program  and could be used for projects to  fix sewer and storm water systems to reduce pollution  restore wetlands that filter water as it flows from land to streams  estuaries and the ocean  and implement watershed protection plans designed to reduce erosion or pollution from non point sources          2  Protect and Restore our Coastline   Senator Clinton is working to provide funding to complete the   Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study      That study is a partnership between the Corps of Engineers  state and local governments  and environmental groups to develop a comprehensive  long term plan to protect coastal areas along the 83 miles of ocean and bay shorelines from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point   The Bush Administration zeroed this study in its budget in 2005  and Senator Clinton fought to restore its funding   This year  she pushed for another  2 5 million for the study   A draft of the plan is due out late this year  and Senator Clinton will push for funding to implement the plan when it is finalized           3  Protect Coastal Ecosystems   Senator Clinton is a cosponsor of the   National Aquatic Invasive Species Act     a bill that addresses the threats posed by harmful  non native aquatic plants and animals  such as the   sea squirt     an animal now invading Long Island Sound  common reeds and other invasive plants that choke many Long Island streams and wetlands  The bill would put several important programs in place  including  a program to require commercial ships to treat ballast water to eliminate invasive species  a program to ban the import of harmful aquatic species in trade  funding to support state programs to control invasive species  the creation of   rapid response    teams to eradicate invasive species that are newly established  and new research initiatives to better understand the pathways through which invasive species come to the United States   The bill would provide  800 million in funding over five years for these programs             4  Guard the Sound  Senator Clinton is a cosponsor of the   Long Island Sound Stewardship Act     which would provide  150 million over 8 years to protect environmentally important land areas around Long Island Sound   Senator Clinton also blocked an EPA plan to permit contaminated dredge spoil dumping in the Sound  and is opposing the Broadwater LNG terminal            ,0

1874,"SEN. SANDERS PAYS TRIBUTE TO MEN, WOMEN IN MILITARY
  In a time of war, Memorial Day takes on special significance as our nation honors men and women in the military who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
   Memorial Day, originally known as Decoration Day, was first observed following the Civil War to commemorate the soldiers who gave their lives in order to preserve our union. After World War I, the day of remembrance was expanded to honor the fallen from all wars fought by the United States.
   Vermont has suffered disproportionately during the war in Iraq. We have lost more lives per capita than any other state. That was the inspiration for Vermont's Fallen, a widely-acclaimed documentary produced by students at Norwich University in Northfield. It is an especially moving tribute to those who lost their lives in Iraq and to their families and friends.
   As the nation marks this Memorial Day weekend, we also should bear in mind the debt we owe to the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan along with veterans who served before them. In this spirit, Senator Sanders has introduced the Comprehensive Veterans Benefits Improvement Act. The legislation would improve health care, insurance, housing, pension, and other benefits for our nation's veterans. It also would address the huge backlog of health care claims at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ""It is the least we can do to show our appreciation for those who sacrifice for their country,"" Sanders said.

1890,"SEN. SANDERS PROPOSES STRENGTHENING NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SAFETY
  On the anniversary of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, Sen. Bernie Sanders today introduced legislation to provide for independent safety assessments before nuclear power plants may boost output or extend operating licenses.  
   ""In an era of aging reactors being pushed past old limits to produce more and more power, the public deserves to know that safety is the single most important priority at nuclear power plants,"" Sanders said on the anniversary of the 1979 partial reactor meltdown at Three Mile Island near Middletown, Pa. ""People who live near Vermont Yankee and near reactors all over the country are entitled to know that everything humanly possible is being done to make certain there will never be another Three Mile Island."" 
   Sanders' legislation would require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct an independent safety assessment when utilities apply to extend licenses for aging plants. The special study could be undertaken at the request of the governor of a state where a plant is located, or by the governor of a neighboring state affected by a plant's operation. State utility regulators also could seek an independent review. 
   Safety reviews also could be requested when electric companies propose to generate more power than a reactor was originally designed to produce. 
   Also under the legislation, a history of safety problems that put the public at risk could trigger a review. 
   The independent review teams would be made up of Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspectors from outside the regional office responsible for the day-to-day scrutiny of a particular plant. The independent inspectors also would include outside experts and representatives appointed by a governor who requested a review or the state Public Utility Commission that sought the review. 
   The inspection team would issue a written report on its findings that would be available for public comment and presented to the NRC before commissioners decide whether to extend a license or allow an increase in power output beyond the maximum level a plant originally was licensed to generate. 
   There are 104 licensed commercial nuclear power plants in the United States which generate about 20 percent of the electricity used nationwide. 
   Although no new plants have been built in decades, energy companies began in the 1970s to seek permission to increase power output. In all, the federal agency that regulates the atomic energy industry has approved 112 so-called uprates at nuclear reactors, including a decision last year to allow a 20 percent boost in generating capacity at Vermont Yankee at Vernon. Another nine applications are pending. 
   New Orleans-based Entergy Nuclear, the company which operates Vermont Yankee, also has an application pending to extend the plant's operating license, which expires in 2012. It wants approval to operate for an additional 20 years.

1293,June 16  2005 Senators Voinovich  Clinton Introduces Bill to Reduce Harmful Emissions From Existing Diesel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    U S  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and George V  Voinovich  Ohio  today introduced bipartisan legislation to further reduce harmful emissions from existing diesel engines  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005  which is also cosponsored by Senators Thomas Carper  Delaware   Johnny Isakson  Georgia   Kay Bailey Hutchison  Texas  and Dianne Feinstein  California   will distribute over  1 billion over 5 years to establish voluntary national grant and loan programs for diesel emission reduction projects and programs that improve air quality and protect public health  The bill will help areas come into attainment for the new air quality standards  Developed with environmental  industry  and public officials  the legislation complements Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  regulations now being implemented that address diesel fuel and new diesel engines         I am pleased that the Administration has taken strong action with new diesel fuel and engine regulations  which were developed in a collaborative effort to substantially reduce diesel emissions  However  I am concerned that the full health benefits will not be realized until 2030 because these regulations address only new engines  The estimated 11 million existing diesel engines have a long life ahead of them and need to be addressed as well  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005 will provide pivotal funding through national and state level grant and loan programs for the voluntary retrofitting of existing diesel engines  I am pleased that such a strong  diverse coalition of environmental  industry  and public officials understands the need for this legislation and is working hard to make it a reality   said Voinovich        Senator Clinton said   I am proud to support this legislation  which will provide funding for proven  cost effective technologies to reduce diesel pollution          Reducing diesel emissions is pivotal in our effort to clean the nation s air  On road heavy duty diesel vehicles  such as transit buses and garbage trucks  and non road diesel vehicles  such as construction equipment and tractors  account for roughly one half of the nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions from mobile sources nationwide  These emissions contribute to ozone formation and fine particulate matter  and they contain numerous other chemicals that are listed by EPA as hazardous air pollutants        EPA has finalized diesel fuel and new engine regulations that will reduce diesel emissions from new diesel buses  freight trucks  and non road equipment by more than 80 percent from 2000 levels  Unfortunately  the full benefits of EPA s rules will not be realized until 2030 because of the long lifetime of the 11 million existing engines  The durability of the diesel engines used to power school buses  trucks and railroads  agriculture processes  and emergency response vehicles can last for hundreds of thousands of miles over a lifetime of up to 30 years        In the meantime  EPA has designated 495 counties nationally and 38 counties in Ohio as in non attainment for the new ozone and or particulate matter air quality standards  Currently  state and local governments are hard at work developing plans to meet the new  fast approaching deadlines for the air quality standards    but without federal assistance  many will fall short        In order to help states and communities meet these standards and reduce exposure to harmful diesel emissions  a voluntary diesel retrofit initiative is needed to substantially reduce emissions from our aging diesel fleets  The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act of 2005  DERA  establishes national and state level grant and loan programs to promote the reduction of diesel emissions  The legislation             Authorizes  1 billion over 5 years   200 million annually         Provides that 70 percent of the funds are distributed by EPA        Allocates 20 percent of funds to states to develop retrofit programs with an additional 10 percent available as an incentive for state s to match the federal dollars being provided        Establishes priority areas for projects    such as those that are more cost effective and affect the most amount of people    and focuses the federal program on public fleets  and       Includes provisions to help develop new technologies  encourage more action through non financial incentives  and require EPA to outreach to stakeholders and report on the success of the program        DERA is based on the understanding that existing engines can benefit from technology that  retrofits  or replaces older engines  In doing so  cost effective emissions reductions can be provided for these fleets and dramatically accelerate the public health benefits        In the near future  states must develop State Implementation Plans  SIPs  to achieve ozone and particulate matter reductions to meet the new air quality standards  This legislation gives states and communities the opportunity and flexibility to design programs to fit their own needs  This legislation will help bring counties into attainment by encouraging the retrofitting or replacement of diesel engines  which will substantially reduce diesel emissions that contribute significantly to ozone and particulate matter        EPA estimates that this billion dollar program would leverage an additional  500 million leading to a net benefit of almost  20 billion with a reduction of about 70 000 tons of particulate matter  This is a 13 to 1 cost benefit ratio            ,0
324,   Obama Calls on FTC to Protect America   s Seniors from Telemarketing Scams   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on FTC to Protect America   s Seniors from Telemarketing Scams Monday  May 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt 202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Federal Trade Commission  FTC  Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras raising serious concerns about whether the FTC has adequately protected America s seniors from abusive telemarketing fraud schemes  According to a report in Sunday   s New York Times  millions of our nation   s senior citizens are at risk of being robbed of their good credit standing  life savings and privacy   In the letter  Senator Obama says that while telemarketing may help seniors maintain access to products and services  seniors must be protected from exploitation  identity theft  and privacy violations   He calls on the FTC to aggressively enforce the law to ensure that the consumer protection challenges faced by vulnerable populations like seniors are addressed  The full text of the letter is below   The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20580   Dear Chairman Majoras   Yesterday  the New York Times published an investigation into telemarketing fraud schemes that exploit vulnerable American seniors  often robbing them of their dignity  their good credit  and even the life savings and financial resources they rely on to pay for food or medication    I am writing to express my concern that the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  is not doing more to deter such schemes and to protect elderly consumers from abusive and fraudulent telemarketing practices   The New York Times story highlighted the ways in which scam artists purchase databases of names of elderly Americans    These lists include names of    Elderly Opportunity Seekers   seniors  looking for ways to make money     Suffering Seniors   people with cancer or Alzheimer s disease   and  Oldies but Goodies   gamblers over 55 years old     Armed with these lists  criminals are able to prey on vulnerable seniors     people like Iowan Richard Guthrie  a 92 year old Army veteran  who lost  100 000 from scams     There is no question that telemarketing and electronic commerce represent important ways for many seniors to participate in the economy as merchants and consumers  But there is also no question that remote transactions present new risks of privacy violations  identity theft  and exploitation of potentially vulnerable consumers     The government must ensure that consumer protection and law enforcement authorities have the right priorities  tools  technologies  and resources to keep up with the evolving threats faced by American consumers    We cannot allow our elderly parents and grandparents to be so easily preyed upon by unscrupulous data brokers and others complicit in deceptive mailings  marketing scams  and outright fraud    The FTC is charged with protecting consumers from fraud  deception  and unfair business practices  The Commission is responsible for enforcing our nation s consumer protection laws and developing rules and procedures to protect and educate consumers  Given this clear mandate  the widespread and sophisticated abuse of many seniors raises a number of questions    What if anything is the FTC doing to assess and address the particular consumer protection challenges faced by seniors or other groups of American consumers who may be especially vulnerable to abuse   In particular  what is the FTC doing to regulate the sale of telemarketing databases to companies that are under investigation or have been prosecuted for fraud   How have FTC resources been allocated to protect rising numbers of seniors who are conducting remote consumer transactions at increasing rates    Are additional resources necessary and for what priority purposes  What if any programs exist to assist seniors with questions or complaints about marketing practices of which they may have been victims    What are the utilization rates of these programs over the past ten years   Have these programs been evaluated  and with what results  Is there adequate coordination between the FTC  the Federal Reserve  and the Department of Justice to ensure effective prevention and prosecution of marketing abuse    What if any multi agency initiatives are currently underway or planned for the near future   Please give specific examples of enforcement actions that have been taken recently against data brokers  telemarketers  or enabling financial institutions   What if any changes to regulatory authority or direction are necessary to enable the FTC to fulfill its consumer protection mandate in light of evolving marketing  communication  and transaction technologies     An FTC that is aggressively enforcing the law is critical to protecting American consumers in a vibrant  fast paced economy    Please respond to the questions above by June 8  2007  I look forward to working with your office to ensure that consumers of all ages can have confidence in their conversations with telemarketers and in all their consumer

1379,February 17  2007 Clinton Plan to End War Reject the President s Escalation  Protect U S  Troops in Iraq  Begin Redeploying Our Troops  Enables President to End War Before Leaving Office                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Introduces the Iraq Troop Reduction   Protection Act of 2007 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton renewed her call on President Bush to reverse course and endorse the plan she outlined several weeks ago that would cap the level of U S  troops in Iraq at the number prior to his escalation plan  and begin the long overdue phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq beginning in 90 days   Senator Clinton outlined her plan when she returned last month from her third trip to Iraq and is formally introduced the legislation yesterday           I came back from Iraq more determined then ever to stop the President s escalation of troops into Iraq  and to start the long overdue redeployment of troops out of Iraq   Senator Clinton said    The Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act that I proposed last month and introduced this week caps the number of troops in Iraq at the level before the President s escalation   It would be against the law to send more  The legislation also protects our troops who are performing so heroically  by making sure they aren t sent to Iraq without the body armor and training they need   empty promises from the President just aren t enough anymore    And it calls for the phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq   I ve been pushing for this for almost two years   Now it s time to say the redeployment should start in ninety days or we will revoke authorization for this war   This plan is a roadmap out of Iraq   I hope the President takes this road   If he does  he should be able to end the war before he leaves office           The Iraq Troop Protection   Reduction Act of 2007 presents a comprehensive approach to Iraq that halts the President s escalation policy and provides an alternative strategy in Iraq with the goal of stabilizing the country so American troops can redeploy out of Iraq   Senator Clinton s legislation puts real pressure on the Iraqi government  requiring the Iraqis to make political progress or lose funding for their military and reconstruction  require the Bush Administration to begin a phased redeployment and convene an international conference within 90 days or a new Congressional authorization would be required to remain in Iraq   Finally  the legislation would prohibit the use of funds to send troops to Iraq unless they have the proper equipment and training   If the President were to follow the provisions in this legislation then the United States should be able to complete a redeployment of troops out of Iraq by the end of his term           A Summary of the legislation    STOPPING THE PRESIDENT S ESCALATION OF THE WAR  This legislation would cap U S  troop numbers in Iraq at the January 1  2007 level   prior to the announcement of the troop escalation by President Bush   It would require Congressional authorization to exceed the cap    ENDING THE BLANK CHECK FOR THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT   Recent press reports have indicated that U S  trained Iraqi security forces may be infiltrated by Iraqi militias and thus U S  funds may have been used to train the very people that our men and women in uniform are fighting   In order to exert leverage on the Iraqi government  the legislation would cut off funds for Iraqi security forces  including private contractors as well as reconstruction funds within 90 days unless the President certifies that the Iraqi government has met certain conditions   The legislation would require that the Iraqi government meet a number of conditions  including         The security forces of the Government of Iraq are free of sectarian and militia influences              The security forces of the Government of Iraq are assuming greater responsibility for security in Iraq              The government of Iraq provides for an equitable distribution of the oil revenues of Iraq              There has been significant progress made in political accommodation among the ethnic and sectarian groups in Iraq            The security forces of the Government of Iraq are assuming greater responsibility for security in Iraq               The government of Iraq provides for an equitable distribution of the oil revenues of Iraq               There has been significant progress made in political accommodation among the ethnic and sectarian groups in Iraq      If Congress disagrees with the President s certification  Congress would have 60 days to  disapprove  of the Presidential certification resulting in a cutoff of funds for the Iraqi government       STARTING PHASED REDEPLOYMENT AND INVOLVING COUNTRIES IN THE REGION IN THE FUTURE OF IRAQ   The legislation requires the U S  begin a phased redeployment of U S  troops in 90 days or the authority of the use of force would cease   Specifically it requires that a phased redeployment of United States military forces from Iraq has begun including the transition of United States forces in Iraq to the limited presence and mission of         Training Iraqi security forces              Providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces              Protecting United States personnel and infrastructure  and              Participating in targeted counter terrorism activities            Providing logistic support of Iraqi security forces               Protecting United States personnel and infrastructure  and               Participating in targeted counter terrorism activities      The legislation also requires that the United States has convened or is convening an international conference so as to            More actively involve the international community and Iraq s neighbors              Promote a durable political settlement among Iraqis              Reduce regional interference in the internal affairs of Iraq              Encourage more countries to contribute to the extensive needs in Iraq  and              Ensure that funds pledged for Iraq are forthcoming            Promote a durable political settlement among Iraqis               Reduce regional interference in the internal affairs of Iraq               Encourage more countries to contribute to the extensive needs in Iraq  and               Ensure that funds pledged for Iraq are forthcoming   PROTECTING OUR TROOPS SENT INTO IRAQ   The legislation would prohibit funds from being spent to send troops to Iraq unless the Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the troops being deployed are adequately equipped and trained for their mission in Iraq            Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq

                      Seniors and most vulnerable citizens supposed to be vaccinated by October 24th  but not all providers have received vaccine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    As reports of seasonal flu vaccine distribution problems surface and the recommended deadline for seniors and most vulnerable citizens to get their vaccine a week away  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt to act immediately to address the delivery issues facing state and local health departments this flu season   She also urged that HHS step up communication and outreach efforts around flu vaccine with state and local providers           I am very troubled by recent reports in New York and across the country that many providers currently find themselves without adequate flu vaccines to administer to their high priority patients and are unsure as to when supplies might arrive  As concern over the pandemic flu continues to mount  it is imperative that we have a seasonal flu vaccine production and delivery system in place that works   There are fixes that can be made and I call upon you to join me in our efforts to strengthen our system so we can better protect the public health     said Senator Clinton        Senator Clinton and Senator Pat Roberts have introduced legislation to help prevent recurring shortages of flu vaccine and strengthen our vaccine delivery infrastructure so that we are able to respond to a crisis   The Clinton Roberts bill  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  addresses the causes of the influenza shortage by bringing increased stability to our nation  s seasonal flu vaccine market  The bill provides a framework through which our public health officials can track vaccines to ensure we have an adequate supply and to make sure high priority populations are vaccinated  The bill also provides technical assistance to companies that wish to produce vaccine domestically  and it will increase education about the importance of obtaining seasonal flu vaccines  The legislation will also strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza         The following is the text of the letter from Senator Clinton to Secretary Leavitt          October 17  2005         The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue S W  Washington  D C   20201       Dear Mr  Secretary        I am very troubled by recent reports in New York and across the country that many providers currently find themselves without adequate flu vaccines to administer to their high priority patients and are unsure as to when supplies might arrive   It is clear that even when we are facing a flu season when a vaccine shortage is not predicted  serious flaws in our procurement and distribution system remain         Since 2000  there have been three shortages of seasonal influenza vaccine   While we are fortunate that a shortage is not expected this season  there is clearly a problem with the delivery and distribution of vaccines   According to the National Association of County and City Health Officials  only six of 120 local health departments surveyed reported no delays in shipments   Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  are recommending that flu shots only be given to priority populations prior to October 24  the deadline is just a week away  and many seniors  long term care residents and chronically ill individuals are still unable to access doses       What is most disconcerting is that the delays we are now facing are entirely predictable  and pertinent information about them can easily be shared with the public   As vaccines cannot be delivered until they have been certified as safe by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   it would seem that within HHS  FDA approvals should be coordinated with CDC issued alerts that would enable state and local health departments  health care institutions  and individual providers to know when the vaccine they have ordered will arrive      I recently introduced legislation with Senator Pat Roberts that contains provisions to enable the CDC and state and local health departments to track the distribution and delivery of vaccine  from the time vaccine leaves the factory to the time it reaches the patient   If such a system were established  it would reduce the confusion and uncertainty that many patients are now facing   It would also enable employees in our nation  s public health infrastructure to devote their time and resources to tasks other than tracking down vaccine   This is not only critical to a fully functioning seasonal influenza vaccine system  but provides one of the fundamental building blocks for an appropriate response to a pandemic crisis        It is critical that HHS act immediately to address the delivery issues facing state and local health departments this flu season   I also urge you to increase communication and outreach efforts regarding flu vaccine with state and local providers to ensure they have the information they need to plan and keep their patients fully informed   I would like to meet with you to discuss needed efforts        As concern over the pandemic flu continues to mount  it is imperative that we have a system in place that works   There are fixes that can be made and I call upon you to join me in our efforts to strengthen our

        Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on her colleagues on the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition   Forestry and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Committee Agriculture  Rural Development and Related Agencies to address the rapid decline in honeybee colonies in New York State and nationwide in the upcoming Farm Bill and Agricultural Appropriations Bill  In letters to both Committees  Senator Clinton pointed out that Colony Collapse Disorder that is decimating bee populations  has the potential to impact honey producers and fruit growers across the state and the nation           This is an unexplained crisis that threatens our honey producers and has already led to massive losses of bees and bee colonies  Not only will this impact the honey industry  it also has the potential to impact our fruit growers who need bees for pollination  I hope that we can address this issue in the upcoming Farm and Agricultural Appropriations Bills and take whatever action is needed to help our honey producers and prevent this situation from becoming even worse   Senator Clinton said          Last month Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in a letter to U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Mike Johanns  asking the Secretary to provide answers on how the USDA is planning to address the increasingly threatening  colony collapse disorder   which has decimated bee colonies throughout the United States          Copies of Senator Clinton s letters are below            May 11  2007      The Honorable Tom Harkin                                        Chairman                                Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  R 328A                                                  United States

Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss       As you consider the upcoming Farm Bill I would like to bring an issue to your attention that is of considerable concern to farmers in New York and across the nation           As you are no doubt aware  a new and unexplained condition known as Colony Collapse Disorder  CCD  is decimating bee colonies throughout the United States  CCD is causing some beekeepers to lose upwards of 90 percent of their bee colonies  and is causing serious reductions in the supplies of bees for essential commercial pollination   These severe losses are in addition to other problems such as higher production costs  mite infestations and unfairly traded imports that have been making it very difficult for beekeepers to operate profitably   If these alarming trends are allowed to continue  they will place at risk in excess of  14 billion in annual United States farm output that depends on bee pollination   Ultimately  the shortage of pollination services could impact the supply of healthful and affordable food for U S  consumers          America s beekeepers and their bees are an indispensable pillar of U S  agriculture   Our nation s beekeepers provide essential pollination services for over 90 different food  seed and fiber crops  contributing over  14 billion of added agricultural value as documented by a Cornell University study in 2000   Crops that depend upon or benefit from honey bee pollination include alfalfa  almonds  apples  avocados  blueberries  cantaloupes  carrots  cherries  citrus  cotton  cranberries  kiwis  plums  pumpkins  seed crops  soybeans  squash  sunflowers and watermelons          The effects of CCD are as prevalent in the state of New York as they are throughout the nation   According to local producers  there have been reports of severe losses in colonies  with many losses being reported of close to fifty percent  and some beekeepers reporting losses of nearly eighty percent   Critical to New York s apple production  there are concerns that the loss of bee colonies here in New York will not be able to be remediated in time for apple pollination  Some estimates have shown that nearly all the major beekeepers in the state of New York have lost more than 30 percent of their colonies to CCD          I believe that reports of this disorder demand a swift response to identify the causes of the problem that threatens to not only impact our bee and honey growers but our fruit growers as well   We must determine the appropriate response to restore the health of our beekeeping industry   We must act quickly to preserve and promote our beekeeping industry          I look forward to working with you to address this important issue in the Farm Bill          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton          May 11  2007      The Honorable Herb Kohl                                          Chairman                                                               Subcommittee

1907,"SEN. SANDERS: PROTECT OUR TROOPS
  The Army will begin large-scale procurement of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles to protect soldiers from makeshift bombs in Iraq. Sen. Sanders had pressed the Pentagon to step up production of the heavily armored vehicles after soldiers from Vermont contacted him with their concerns. USA Today reported on Monday that the Pentagon approved an Army request for a 600 percent increase in production of the new vehicles.  
   After receiving appeals from Vermonters serving in Iraq, Sanders responded by writing and calling top brass at the Defense Department. ""It has come to my attention that soldiers serving in Iraq from my state of Vermont do not have the proper equipment to carry out their mission,"" the senator wrote in a June 8 letter to Army Secretary Preston M. Geren III. ""Soldiers have already lost their lives due to the fact that they were in vehicles not built for this difficult mission,"" Sanders said. In the letter Sanders also questioned how, after more than four years of war in Iraq, the Bush administration still has not properly planned for the proper protection of our service men and women.
   For more than two years, requests from field commanders for better armor-protected vehicles were largely ignored. The Pentagon about face, Sanders said, is welcome news.
   Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) account for 70 percent of the casualties in Iraq. The greatest threat from these IEDs today comes in the form of roadside bombs that blow through the weakly-armored bottoms of conventional vehicles, according to Major General Dennis Hejlik. With a heavily-armored, V-shaped hull that deflects the force of the explosion, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles hold a significant advantage over vehicles such as the widely-used Humvee. This advantage has been shown in the success of the new vehicles deployed by the Marine Corps in Anbar Province. In some 300 IED attacks on these vehicles, there has not been a single casualty.
   Sanders and others remain concerned about the current capacity to produce the new armored vehicles. Tom Miller, who was the head of the Marine Corps Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle program in 2005, said then that a modest request for 1,200 of the vehicles could not be filled. Senator Sanders believes that we should not rely on foreign countries to supply our service men and women with such crucial equipment. With a country as advanced as the United States we surely have the capability to produce these vehicles in America in a fast and efficient way.

1774,"HOT AS HELL
  A B-24 bomber flying a World War II mission over the Himalayas in 1944 crashed into a mountainous region of northeastern India. The lost crew included two Vermonters; Capt. William A. Swanson of Proctor, the pilot, and Lt. Irwin ""Zipper"" Zaetz of Burlington, the navigator. One year ago, a mountain climber trekking through rugged terrain 9,000 feet above sea level discovered a portion of a wing with numbers identifying the plane, the Hot as Hell. He notified relatives of the crash victims. They turned to a Department of Defense task force for help recovering the remains. The joint command has brought home members of the armed services who paid the ultimate sacrifice in extremely challenging locations all over the globe, from cliffs in Papua, New Guinea, to 16,000-foot peaks in the Himalayas, ""How is it then,"" Senator Bernie Sanders asked in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, ""that the Department of Defense cannot send a recovery team to an ally's country to recover the remains of American servicemen?"" 
   The Burlington Free Press published an article on Sunday about the World War II plane crash, the mountain climber's discovery, and the efforts by the families to have their relatives remains returned to the United States.

Snowstorm  Buffalo  NY  At a ceremony at City Honors School today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with Buffalo Mayor Byron W  Brown and representatives from the University at Buffalo  Re Tree WNY  American Forests  International Paper XpedX  Davey Tree and others to hold a planting ceremony for two historic trees   one from the estate of Eleanor Roosevelt and the other will be a tree from the estate of Franklin Delano Roosevelt   that were donated as part of a commitment to replacing the trees that were lost in last years early snowstorm     Prior to the ceremony  Senator Clinton addressed students from City Honors School and other area schools about the need for a new approach to energy efficiency and renewable energy  not only to address global warming and the environment but to support Western New Yorks future  The Senate is currently considering the Energy Bill and already this week approved a green job training proposal that Senator Clinton introduced with Senator Bernie Sanders  I VT  as part of the Energy Bill  Read More     Senator Clinton has also introduced a bill to create a  50 billion Strategic Energy Fund paid for in part by closing the corporate tax loopholes for oil companies already reaping the largest profits in history  The fund would invest in tax incentives and research to promote conservation  efficiency  and technologies available right now  while also investing in cutting edge research so America can lead the world in new  21st century green industries  Read More    The Energy Bill that is currently before the Senate presents a unique opportunity move away from the failed approach of subsidizing oil companies while downplaying efficiency and conservation  and to take a different road  Senator Clinton said  We need a smarter energy policy that emphasizes greater energy efficiency in our buildings and vehicles  renewable fuels that fuels to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and a national goal to produce more of our electricity from renewable sources    Today  the Senator announced the donation of 2300 saplings which will be delivered to each 4th grade student in the Buffalo Public Schools over the next year  The saplings were organized through Senator Clintons office with the assistance of the Department of Environmental Conservation through the Saratoga Tree Nursery School Seedling Program  The Senator also announced that American Forests will provide tree planting educational materials for children who will be receiving the saplings to plant at home  At the ceremony  the Senator also distributed 300 seed packets from Eleanor Roosevelts White Ash in Hyde Park  NY  to all of the children in attendance    Earlier this year  Senator Clintons office  Re Tree WNY and the University at Buffalo teamed up to begin planting the first of 120 historic trees that Senator Clinton and UB organized for schools throughout Buffalo  The 120 historic trees were donated by American Forests  who worked with Citadel Broadcasting  International Paper XpedX  and Davey Tree to secure the funds for the trees  Read More    Every Western New Yorker here will most certainly remember the snowstorm that dumped between 18 and 24 inches of snow this past October  In addition to the terrible damage it wrought on homes and infrastructure  the storm also devastated the beautiful tree canopy for which Buffalo is known  Senator Clinton said  I promised then that I would continue to do everything I could to help Buffalo and the impacted communities recover and rebuild as soon as possible   That is why I went to work and put together a team of government  not for profit  private  and educational partners to begin bringing trees back to Buffalo  I am so pleased that we have now secured over 2 400 trees for Buffalo   It is my hope that many of the students and future leaders we have in the crowd today will make their own  unique commitments to important causes  like the environment    I am thrilled that Senator Clinton was able to secure these historic trees to enhance our efforts to re tree Buffalo after the October Surprise storm  said Buffalo Mayor Byron W  Brown   The City of Buffalo thanks Senator Clinton for the trees and supports her efforts towards a more energy efficient economy    Our project here in Western New York is unique     I understand that the power companies said it was the most damage from a snowstorm they ever encountered   The aftermath was a huge setback to our area  which is world renowned for its urban forest   The Senator s help has been critical to our early success and we need all of our WNY human resources to join in this effort to re tree our area over the next five years  said Paul Maurer  Co Chairman  Re Tree WNY    The University at Buffalo is proud to have had the opportunity to partner with Senator Clinton  area schools and Re Tree Western New York to replace trees lost during last Octobers devastating snowstorm  said James A  Willis  UB interim

773,September 10  2007 Senators Clinton and Smith Applaud Unanimous Senate Approval of Resolution to Support Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Gordon H  Smith  R OR  today applauded unanimous Senate approval of a Senate resolution they introduced earlier this year designating November as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month  The resolution will bring attention to the need for increased research funding  early detection methods  and treatment  as well as public education about pancreatic cancer      Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month will bring much needed attention to a disease that is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States   I am pleased my colleagues have unanimously approved this resolution  as it is critically important to educate communities in New York and across the country about early detection methods and treatment programs for this deadly disease  said Senator Clinton      Like many cancers  early detection is key to survival and recovery  said Senator Smith   Pancreatic cancer  however  is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths because it is seldom detected in its early stages   My mother  Jessica Udall Smith  is among the thousands who suffered and ultimately lost her battle with pancreatic cancer   The goal of this resolution is to support increased research funding  early detection methods  and effective treatments and programs to help put an end to high fatality rates from this destructive disease    The leadership Senators Clinton and Smith are providing for this initiative is critical in raising support for pancreatic cancer  says Julie Fleshman  President  CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network  Our hope is that through this continued legislative support  pancreatic cancer will begin to develop the kind of funding  early detection  and treatment progress we need to increase the survival rate to parallel the range of other cancers    The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2007  over 2 300 New Yorkers and 37 170 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer  and more than 33 000 Americans will die from this disease   The resolution passed today highlights the difficulty in detecting and treating pancreatic cancer  as there has been no significant improvement in survival rates over the last 25 years   Seventy five percent of pancreatic cancer patients die within the first year of diagnosis due to a lack of early detection tests   Furthermore  the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is 40 to 50 percent higher in African Americans than in other ethnic groups         ,0
739,June 10  2005 Clinton Wins Senate Language To Block Contaminated Sediment Study

                 At Clinton  s request  Senate Appropriations Committee disagrees with House study requirement that threatens to derail the Hudson River clean up    Final decision to be made in House Senate Conference after full Senate approval of committee bill                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has included language in the Senate version of the FY 2006 Interior Appropriations bill that opposes a provision in the House version of the bill requiring the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  to begin a new study of contaminated sediments  which could have derailed the Hudson River clean up project        The House study requirement was included in the House Interior Appropriations bill in May at the request of General Electric  Following consideration and passage on the Senate floor  the bill will head into a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between the two bills          I am pleased that the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with my concerns about the study  which has the potential to delay the Hudson clean up     Senator Clinton said    I will continue to work with my colleagues to help that the House provision does not become law           On May 18th  Senator Clinton sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee  expressing her concern that a new and largely duplicative NAS study could mean further delays in the Hudson clean up  as well as at other sites with contaminated sediment across the country   Senator Clinton called on Senators Burns and Dorgan to include language opposing the House study provision when their Committee acts on the Senate version of the Interior Appropriations bill next week         The Committee responded to her request by including the following language in the Interior Appropriations report          At this time  the Committee disagrees with the position of the House as to the need for an additional contaminated sediment sites study and does not recommend that EPA enter into any further agreement with the National Academy of Sciences           In her letter of May 18  Senator Clinton said that the NAS study requirement included in the House bill focuses only on clean up costs  rather than on the full range of contaminated sediment issues recommended for further study by the NAS in 2001   In addition  the Senator is concerned that the study language could be interpreted as requiring a protracted review of the EPA  s cleanup decisions at all contaminated sediment sites  ignoring the fact that EPA has recently put a detailed review process for contaminated sediment sites in place          The language included in the House bill focuses almost exclusively on remedial costs and would re open many of the issues surrounding the Hudson River that were decided by EPA in 2002 after more than a decade of study     Senator Clinton said    The clean up should go forward as planned  and I will be working with my Congressional colleagues to help ensure that it does            A copy of Senator Clinton  s May 18th letter is attached        May 18  2005       The Honorable Conrad Burns  Chairman        The Honorable Byron L  Dorgan  Ranking Member       Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510        Dear Chairman Burns and Ranking Member Dorgan        As you prepare to markup the FY 2006 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill  I write to urge you to include language in the Senate report disagreeing with language added to the House report last week regarding contaminated sediments   Page 115 of the House report directs the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to contract with the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  to answer a number of questions associated with EPA  s efforts to clean up contaminated sediments   This language was inserted at the request of General Electric        Although the House language purports to build on the recommendations of a recent National Research Council study entitled   A Risk Management Strategy for PCB Contaminated Sediments     the questions that the report directs the NAS to focus on have little to do with those recommendations   The NAS recommended assessing the human health and ecological risks of single chlorobiphenyls in particular environments  a range of risks presented by sites contaminated with PCBs and other pollutants  the fate and transport of PCBs in sediments  improvement of remedial technologies  the impact of continuing PCB releases and the global cycling of PCBs   By contrast  most of the questions in the House report focus on cost considerations relevant primarily to potentially responsible parties        The last question in the House report asks the NAS to review the EPA  s decisions at contaminated sediment sites to determine whether EPA regions are following agency sediment remediation guidance and   recommendations made by the  NAS  in its 2001 report     This could be interpreted to ask for a protracted review of the EPA  s cleanup decisions at all contaminated sediment sites  and ignores the fact that EPA has recently put a detailed review process for contaminated sediment sites in place   Key stakeholders are already integrated early on in this review process to help inform the EPA  s remedial decisions        With all of these factors in mind  I believe that requiring a new NAS study would do more harm than good  and could stall decisions and action on cleanup of contaminated sediments at sites across the country   I am especially concerned that this study could be used by General Electric to stall cleanup of the Hudson River   In 2002  after more than a decade of scientific investigation and analysis    including considerable governmental scrutiny and an extensive peer review process that provides the foundation for the agency  s proposed clean up plan    the EPA finalized its decision to require General Electric to cleanup PCB contaminated sediments from hot spots in the Hudson River   The EPA decision reflected the agency  s scientific conclusion that dredging hotspots was the best way to eliminate the continuing health and environmental impacts caused by the estimated 1 3 million pounds of PCBs that General Electric released into the Hudson   After years of additional work since the EPA decision was finalized in 2002  cleanup work is set to begin in 2006   Yet the study language included in the House bill is clearly intended to revisit many of the issues that were decided in 2002 by EPA after extensive study   The Hudson River cleanup should not be delayed by further study   I urge you to include language in the FY 2006 Senate Interior Appropriations report disagreeing with the House requirement for an NAS study of contaminated sediments       Sincerely yours      Hillary Rodham Clinton

214,   Obama Calls on Gates to Ensure All Service Members Receive Full Educational Benefits   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Calls on Gates to Ensure All Service Members Receive Full Educational Benefits Wednesday  October 17  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Urges Gates to Consider Waivers to Get National Guard and Reservists Benefits They Deserve   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates  expressing concerns that some members of the National Guard and Reserves are being denied educational benefits they deserve after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   Members of the National Guard and Reserves are required to serve for 730 days in order to receive the education benefits earned by those who serve in active duty   However  according to news reports  many returning National Guard and Reservists have discovered that they will not receive these benefits either because their service fell a few days short of 730 days  or because their service orders were issued for a few days less than 730 days  In the letter  Obama  a member of the Senate Veterans    Affairs Committee  calls on Gates to clarify the Department   s authority to provide waivers for these service members  evaluate how widespread the problem is  and propose recommendations to resolve this problem     The fact that those men and women in the National Guard and Reserves who put their lives on the line to serve their country are being denied full educational benefits is simply wrong  and we need to fix this problem today     Senator Obama said      Like members of our military serving in active duty  service members in National Guard and Reserve leave their families  and risk life and limb for our country   There is no reason that they should have to fight this kind of bureaucratic mess to be able to access the benefits they deserve when they come home   I urge Secretary Gates to address this issue as soon as possible and consider any options that will allow us to fully keep promise to these heroes and their families     Below is a copy of the letter     October 16  2007 The Honorable Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301 1000 Dear Secretary Gates   As you know  in many cases  members of the National Guard and Reserves are required to serve for 730 days in order to receive the level of educational benefits afforded to their active duty counterparts   However  according to recent news accounts  a number of returning service members have discovered that they will not receive these benefits either because they served a few days less than 730 days  or because their service orders were issued for a few days less than 730 days    I believe that these members of the National Guard and Reserves are being unfairly treated  and I ask that you exercise some flexibility and  where appropriate  grant waivers from this service requirement for educational benefits  This problem is just one challenge presented by the complexity of the current maze of educational benefits and the varying eligibility requirements facing our returning service members   Even as Congress works to update these benefits  slash red tape  and ensure fairness and equity for our service members  I would ask that you respond to these interim questions   What statutory authority  if any  does the Department of Defense currently have to provide waivers for those cases in which members of the Guard or Reserves have fulfilled their commitment to serve our nation but have fallen short of receiving benefits that are due to their active duty counterparts   What plans are underway to review orders issued since 9 11 to Guard members and Reservists to determine how widespread this problem is  and does the Pentagon plan to provide waivers for these cases   If so  what would be the military   s threshold for time served in order to grant the more generous educational benefit to members of the Guard and Reserves until the law can be revised   What legislative changes would the Department recommend to correct the inequities in the eligibility criteria for educational benefits for our service members   While there are different views of the war in our country  I know there is no disagreement about the tremendous sacrifice being made by the men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   They have performed valiantly under exceedingly difficult circumstances   They have done everything that we have asked of them   And at a minimum  we owe them educational benefits that are understandable  accessible  and are commensurate with their noble service   For that reason  I ask that you exercise some degree of flexibility in addressing cases of Guard and Reserve members who have fallen a few days short of receiving the educational benefits they deserve and  wherever appropriate  I ask that you grant waivers from this service requirement   Thank you for your consideration to this request     Sincerely     Barack Obama   United States Senator                                    ,1

                  Calls on President s Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to Recommend Approval of Special Cohort to Compensate Former Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today submitted testimony to a meeting of the Presidents Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  which was meeting to consider a special exposure cohort petition for Bethlehem Steel Workers  Senator Clinton has long fought to establish a special cohort for former Bethlehem Steel employees and urged the Presidents Advisory Board recommend approval of the petition  The Board could make a decision about the petition as soon as today    At a meeting of the Presidents Advisory Board earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined Representatives Brian Higgins  Louise Slaughter  Thomas Reynolds and Senator Charles E  Schumer in calling on them to recommend approval of the petition by former Bethlehem Steel workers to create a Special Exposure Cohort for those who worked in Bethlehem Steel s nuclear weapons program during the Cold War  Approval of this petition would make the former nuclear workers eligible to receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program if exposure records do not allow case by case decisions to be made    Senator Clinton is also a sponsor of legislation to reform the compensation program for nuclear workers at Bethlehem Steel and other former New York atomic weapons production facilities  The bill would enable employees to be added to a special exposure cohort and receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program if exposure records do not enable case by case decisions to be made   Senator Clinton has also called on the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  of which she is a member  to hold a hearing on the Administrations failure to properly implement the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000  EEOICPA       A copy of Senator Clintons testimony is below      Written Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Behalf of Special Cohort Status for Bethlehem Steel Workers  Presidents Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  July 18  2007   The Presidents Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health has the authority and responsibility to oversee the work the agencies that implement the Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  One of the boards specific responsibilities is to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services about whether to approve special exposure cohort petitions that have been referred by NIOSH   You have such a petition before you today for a class of workers at Bethlehem Steel   I urge you to recommend approval of the petition      Like workers at many other sites around New York and our country  Bethlehem Steel employees were essential to our Cold War effort  These people literally built our nuclear arsenal in the decades after World War II and helped us eventually to win the Cold War  In the late 40s and early 50s  the government contracted with Bethlehem Steel to roll uranium at their plant  But the workers werent told what they were working with  They werent provided with safety equipment to shield them from radiation  They werent monitored to determine how much radiation they were being exposed to     Many of these workers subsequently got cancer  And for decades they petitioned their government for help and have been denied  Congress finally did the right thing in 2000 with the act that you are part of administering  This was a landmark law and it was such in the tradition of our country to acknowledge the wrong that the government had done  and promise timely compensation to workers and their survivors     When Congress passed the law in 2000  it recognized that reconstructing doses would be impossible in many cases and thats why the special cohort process was included in the law  The statute to my reading is pretty clear  It says that if the government doesnt have the information to reconstruct doses then workers should be given the benefit of the doubt and their claims should be paid  More precisely it provides for classes of workers to be added to a special exposure cohort if its not feasible to estimate the radiation doses with sufficient accuracy  and there is reasonable likelihood that the radiation dose may have endangered their health     I dont think we could have a clearer case than Bethlehem Steel where not a single worker wore a radiation badge  where the only radiation measurements we have are a handful of air samples  where the workers rolled uranium and where many of them contracted radiation related cancers     I have introduced legislation with Senator Schumer that would require approval of special exposure cohorts in such cases  as I believe the original statute requires   But I appeal to you today to bring the Bethlehem Steel process to a conclusion by recommending approval of the petition   Thank you         ,0

Contact  John Hart or Aaron Cooper   202  228 5357  Date  September 14  2005 Obama  Coburn to Introduce Hurricane Katrina Oversight Legislation   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today introduced the Oversight of Vital Emergency Recovery Spending Enhancement and Enforcement Act  OVERSEE   which is designed to ensure financial integrity in the Hurricane Katrina relief and recovery effort    Last week  Congress approved  62 billion for Gulf Coast relief and rebuilding efforts   most of which will go directly to FEMA   said Obama   This is twelve times the amount of money FEMA was given last year   more than it has ever been trusted to spend before  If FEMA s track record during the rescue effort and in years before is any indication of how they will perform during the rebuilding that lies ahead  this should concern every taxpayer and every citizen interested in helping the millions of Americans who have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina     Previous rebuilding efforts involving FEMA and other government agencies have a history of fraud  corruption  and waste when there is no oversight or accountability in how the funds are spent  Following Hurricane Frances in 2004  FEMA awarded  30 million and approved more than 12 000 claims for residents of Miami Dade County  The storm  however  made landfall 100 miles north and Miami Dade never even saw hurricane force winds    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    As we look towards the massive Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts ahead  we must demand accountability over how the billions of dollars we ve given to FEMA are spent   said Obama   The CFO will also specifically look at whether federal funds are going to people most in need  whether federal funds are going to companies that hire local workers  and the extent to which the federal government is using no bid and  cost plus  contracts  As you ll recall  these contracts are what caused the whole contracting mess in Iraq      Even if the Levees hadn t burst and New Orleans didn t flood  Hurricane Katrina would still be the largest natural disaster this country has ever faced  and the rebuilding effort will be certainly be the largest and costliest of its kind  This entrusts FEMA with a massive amount of responsibility  and so it s only right that we protect both taxpayers and citizens on the Gulf Coast with strict accountability and oversight about how the money is being spent and whether it s being most efficiently directed to helping people rebuild their lives    SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT  A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina  Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse  The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President  The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of sole source and  cost plus  contracts  The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the extent of waste  fraud  and abuse in federal spending  the use of sole source or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used appropriately by state and local agencies  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers  The CFO position would terminate one year after the enactment of the bill but could be extended for an additional year by the President                                    ,1

1921,"SEN. SANDERS ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS: ACT NOW BUT GET IT RIGHT
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today pressed for passage of a stronger economic stimulus package than the House approved on Tuesday. He urged senators to increase help for senior citizens and veterans, and he said he would fight for substantial relief for people struggling to pay skyrocketing home heating bills. 
   ""We have serious economic problems,"" Sanders said. ""Let's pass an economic stimulus package quickly, but let's make sure we get it right.""
   The Senate Finance Committee recommended significant improvements to the House version of the bill, especially for seniors and veterans, Sanders said. 
   ""Low-income senior citizens across this country are facing very serious economic problems and, like low- and middle-income working people, they also need help. That is why I strongly support the provision which will enable over 20 million senior citizens to get a $500 rebate."" 
   Sanders also applauded the Senate committee version of the bill for providing a rebate to about 250,000 veterans who receive disability compensation and for extending unemployment benefits for 13 extra weeks in all states and for 26 weeks in states experiencing severe joblessness.
   Still, Sanders said, the Senate should do more. He is fighting to expand the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. ""Without increased home heating help, senior citizens on fixed incomes, persons with disabilities, and low-income families with children are in danger of going cold in Vermont and throughout the country. We must not let that happen. LIHEAP must be a part of this package.""
   During the last economic slowdown in 2001, Sanders was the first person in Congress to propose income tax rebates as a way to stimulate the economy, an idea that at the time was scoffed at by leading congressional conservatives. Now, he said, rebates are an important part of the current stimulus package, but investments that create good-paying jobs also are needed.
   ""Giving someone $500 or $600 alone will not fix the economic situations facing millions of Americans,"" Sanders said. ""Putting Americans to work at decent-paying jobs and helping those most in need could do much more to strengthen the middle class and reduce the poverty rate.""

1905,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON GLOBAL WARMING
  Senator Bernie Sanders called a blueprint for legislation on global warming laid out today by Senators Joseph Lieberman and John Warner a positive step, but Sanders said the peril to our planet from greenhouse gas emissions calls for a more aggressive approach to stop climate change. 
   ""I commend Senator Lieberman and Senator Warner for their hard work in putting together legislation that our subcommittee will consider. There is no doubt that we need bipartisan support in the United States Senate to address the most significant environmental threat our planet has ever seen.
   ""Given the dimensions of the crisis, however, I strongly believe that we must act aggressively to halt and then reverse global warming. I am concerned that the outline my colleagues put out today, which is a good starting point, does not go far enough. As good as it is, I hope we can do better. As a member of the subcommittee, I look forward to working with them.""
   Sanders and Senator Barbara Boxer, chairman of the full Environment and Public Works Committee, are the lead sponsors of the comprehensive Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, which calls for reducing emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
   ""The people of the United States want strong action, and the Senate must follow. In my view, we can, in fact, break our dependency on fossil fuels, substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions, move to sustainable energy and, in the process, create millions of good paying jobs. Those are the principles that I will fight for.""

Higher Education Programs and Funding Formula                                                                                                                                                                                Buffalo  NY    At a press conference today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with leaders from Princeton Review in announcing a new public private partnership that will give Buffalo s young people an academic edge in today s increasingly competitive world  Through a partnership created by Clinton s office with Princeton Review  State Senator Byron Brown  and the Buffalo Public Schools  Princeton Review has agreed to lower the cost of its ACT SAT trainings from over  1 000 to  350 for any Buffalo Public School student who would like to take the class  Additionally  Princeton Review has committed to set up a scholarship fund to cover the full cost for students who cannot afford the reduced rate          This is an important and inspiring example of how private sector companies can make an enormous contribution in helping our most disadvantaged students prepare for college and a brighter future   Senator Clinton said   We need more efforts like this one because as we all know  college is becoming less and less affordable          As federal financial aid has failed to keep up with the rising costs of tuition  initiatives such as this one are more important than ever  For families in the lowest income quartile  average public university costs now consume 62 percent of their income    compared to 42 percent in the early 1970 s        Unfortunately  these increased costs have been accompanied by the Bush Administration s proposed cuts to critical higher education programs that hundreds of thousands of students depend on each school year  In particular  the administration has implemented changes to the student financial aid funding formula that will prevent approximately 90 000 students from receiving Pell Grants  and will lower the grant award for thousands more         At the press conference  Clinton reiterated her commitment to restoring funds to programs critical to many potential college students and announced that she will be joining Senator Jon S  Corzine  D NJ  in introducing legislation that will force the U S  Department of Education to give every student who will lose aid under the Administration s formula change  a rebate on the aid he or she is due          The global marketplace is becoming increasingly competitive and unforgiving  If we are going to thrive as a nation  we must ensure that our young men and women have the tools they need to compete   Clinton said   This legislation is critical for New York because students here are faced with higher college costs to begin with and more students come to New York to attend our exceptional colleges and universities          A Government Accountability Office investigation estimates that under the Bush Administration s formula change  67  of New York students will have to pay more for college  On average  each student will lose an additional  639 annually in student financial aid  In New York  45  of students will experience a decrease in their Pell Grants         According to the American Council of Education  the new calculations would disqualify 89 000 low income students from the Pell Grant  An additional 1 3 million    including 95 000 in New York    would see a reduction in their student aid        Furthermore  the Administration has proposed harmful changes to programs such as TRIO and the Perkins loan program    both of which are depended on by well over 100 000 New York college students each year  Under the Perkins loan program  which the Administration has proposed eliminating all together  New York State disburses  8 6 million in loans each year  Without these funds hundreds of thousands of New York students would be losing out on a critical funding source for their futures         If the TRIO cuts proposed by the Administration are not restored  New York will lose  3 million in funding  More importantly  2 000 young people will lose the hope of a college education and the opportunity that education brings        Clinton is leading the charge with many of her colleagues in the New York Congressional delegation who have TRIO programs in their districts to protest these cuts  They have called on the Department of Education to conduct an external review of the New York applications and make sure they are aware that New York students are disproportionately going to suffer if these applications are not given a second look         At a time when families are struggling to send their children to college  the federal government should be doing all it can to support this investment  The United States has a long and proud tradition of investing in its children  and it is this tradition that has made us the leading nation in the world  To reverse that practice will hurt our young people  and will seriously weaken our standing and competitiveness in the global marketplace   Clinton said             ,0
1862,"COURT WEAKENS CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW
  The Supreme Court gutted a key provision of a landmark campaign finance law. In a 5 to 4 decision, the court opened a huge loophole in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, better know as the McCain-Feingold law. Justices struck down a section of the law that banned companies and unions from mentioning the names of federal candidates in advertisements run during the 60 days before a general election or the 30 days before a primary. ""The challenge we still face is to rein the influence and power that corporations have over the Congress,"" Sanders said.  
   ""Despite what anyone may have heard, corporate interests are king. Corporate interests give ten times more money to candidates as labor unions,"" Sanders said. In the 2006 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, labor gave less than $50 million, while corporate interests gave well over $525 million.
   ""That disparity may well explain why the needs of working Americans all too often take a back seat to corporate interests in the Congress,"" Sanders said. ""But more importantly that tells us why we need real campaign finance reform so that the needs of all Americans are heard rather than just those who make these kinds of contributions. We need a revival of grass-roots democracy that pressures Washington to represent the needs of the middle class and working families of our country, and not just the wealthy corporate interests.""
   Justice David H. Souter, writing for the four dissenters, stated the case clearly. ""Contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence. Voters know this,"" he said.
   ""Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, pose by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries,"" Justice Souter added. ""After today,"" he concluded, ""the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation of their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.
   The disappointing but not unexpected ruling was the latest in a string of corporation-friendly decisions by the increasingly conservative court. ""As George W. Bush staggers toward the conclusion of his second term, he can point to at least one major and enduring project that has gone according to plan: the transformation of the Supreme Court,"" Jeffrey Toobin wrote in The New Yorker about the first full term in which Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., and Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr., served together. ""The changes on the Court, and their implications for the nation, have been profound.""

341,   Kennedy  Specter  Obama  Senators Work to Overturn Supreme Court Decision on Pay Discrimination   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Kennedy  Specter  Obama  Senators Work to Overturn Supreme Court Decision on Pay Discrimination Friday  July 20  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  No American Should be Denied Equal Pay for Equal Work      Led Better Decision Undermines American Principles WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Obama  D IL  joined a bipartisan group of fourteen Senators  led by Senators Kennedy and Specter  to introduce the Fair Pay Restoration Act  a bill to overturn the Supreme Court   s recent 5 4 decision in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company  which undermined the basic protection against pay discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964   The decision also undermines pay discrimination claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act  The bill would restore the clear intent of Congress that workers must have a reasonable time to file a pay discrimination claim after they become victims of discriminatory compensation       I was deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court   s ruling in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company     said Senator Obama      Contrary to Congress    intent and longstanding precedent  the conservative majority held that workers may not sue their employers for pay discrimination that originated years earlier     even if the unequal pay continues today   This strikes at the heart of equality in this country      Obama added      As Justice Ginsburg explained in her dissent  this ruling will make it extremely difficult to remedy gender and racial discrimination in the workplace under Title VII   Workers will often not discover that they have been discriminated against until years after the initial decision to issue unequal pay checks   At a time when women only earn 77 cents to every dollar that a man makes  we simply cannot let this decision stand   That is why I am pleased to join this bi partisan group of Senators to introduce common sense legislation to overturn this decision and make sure that all workers receive the guarantee of equal pay for equal work       The supporters of this bill believe that no American should be denied equal pay for equal work  Employees    ability to provide for their children  save for retirement  and enjoy the benefit of their labor should not be limited by discrimination  The Court   s decision undermined these bedrock principles by imposing unrealistically short time limits on such claims    The House Committee on Education and Labor recently passed the bill   s House counterpart  and the bill is ready for floor action in the House   The bill   s co sponsors are Senators Kennedy  D MA   Specter  R PA   Obama  D IL   Harkin  D IA   Snowe  R ME   Clinton  D NY   Mikulski  D MD   Durbin  D IL   Dodd  D CT   Leahy  D VT   McCaskill  D MO   Whitehouse  D RI   Boxer  D CA   Stabenow  D MI  and Murray  D WA    Below is a summary of the bill   The Fair Pay Restoration Act The Fair Pay Restoration Act would clarify that the laws against pay discrimination apply to every paycheck or other compensation a worker receives   The bill   s protection would extend to pay discrimination based on race  national origin  gender  religious  age or disability   The bill overturns Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Co   a divided Supreme Court held that workers must sue for pay discrimination within 180 days after the original pay setting decision  no matter how long the unfair pay continues       Under the case  it doesn   t matter if the discrimination is still ongoing today  and the worker initially had no way of knowing that others were being paid more for the same work  So workers receiving an unfairly low wage today could still be out of time to hold the company accountable if they did not discover the discrimination soon after it first began  The Fair Pay Restoration Act will   Restores a fair  reasonable time limit for filing pay discrimination claims   The bill would start the clock for filing pay discrimination claims when compensation is received  rather than when the employer decides to discriminate  Each discriminatory paycheck would restart the clock for filing a pay discrimination claim   As long as workers file their claims within 180 days of a discriminatory paycheck  their charges will be considered timely   Retains a fair limit on the amount employers owe   Under the Kennedy bill  employers would not have to make up for salary differences that occurred decades ago  Current law limits back pay in job discrimination cases to two years before the worker filed a discrimination claim   The bill would not change this two year limit on back pay   Restores Congressional intent   The bill mirrors language prohibiting discriminatory seniority systems  which was included in the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1991  The 1991 Act was signed by the first President Bush in 1991 with broad bipartisan support  passing the House 381 38 and the Senate 93 to 5                                   ,1

1852,"SENATE BILL WOULD ALLOW VERMONT TO ENFORCE STRENGTHENED AUTO EMISSION RULES
  A bill to be introduced in the Senate today would override an Environmental Protection Agency ruling and let Vermont and other states enforce tougher vehicle emission rules to curb global warming. 
   Cosponsored by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the bill by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) was being fine tuned on the same day EPA Administrator Steven Johnson was summoned before a Senate panel she chairs to explain why he shunned the advice of EPA experts and blocked California, Vermont and other states from enforcing their own emission standards.
   Sanders, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, told the EPA administrator: ""If you can't do the right thing, at least get out of the way of California, Vermont and other states. If we do not move aggressively, this planet is in danger.""
   Leahy said, ""The Bush Administration has been AWOL or worse on air quality issues, and now they even want to undermine states like California and Vermont that are trying to pick up the slack. They won't lead and they won't follow, so this bill would force them at least to get out of the way and stop obstructing states like ours that are trying to lead on clean air policy.""
   Questioned by Sanders during the sometimes contentions hearing, the EPA administrator hedged on whether global warming is a major crisis. ""I don't know what you mean by major crisis,"" Johnson responded. The usual definition would be fine, Sanders said. Johnson would only say the issue was ""serious."" The EPA's decision to deny the California waiver would make sense, Sanders explained to the administrator, if, as Sanders believes, the Bush administration did not consider global warming a crisis. ""Your responses tell us why the entire world wonders what is happening in the United States on this issue,"" the senator concluded.
   At the same hearing, Vermont Governor James Douglas testified on the potential impact of global warming on Vermont's ski industry, maple production and other sectors of the economy. Douglas said ""global warming could threaten our way of life and we have an obligation to do all we can to protect our environment for future generations.""
   In the House, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) rallied 89 members of Congress in September to urge the EPA to let California adopt stricter standards. He also led a successful effort to block a proposal before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would have prohibited states from adopting auto emission standards tougher than those imposed by the federal government.
   The California rules that Vermont and other states want to adopt would require automakers to average 43.7 mpg by 2016 for passenger cars and some small SUVs and 26.6 mpg for larger light trucks.

an Administration initiative to require passports at U S  borders  In her letter  Senator Clinton asked that they carefully review the proposed policy based on the serious concerns of New York s

    National security and  in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount and I have made security at New York s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate  However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact of this proposal on tourism and the regional economy  I would urge that your departments consider this proposal very carefully and take into account the very real concerns of the business and residential communities along New York s Northern Border   Senator Clinton wrote          Based on the immediate and dramatic response of New Yorkers to the announcement of your initiative  it is imperative that your departments listen closely to the voices of my constituents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce   Senator Clinton continued   I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and respectfully request an immediate briefing for my staff on

require United States and Canadian citizens to utilize a passport to enter the U S  from Canada        According to the April 5  2005 State Department announcement  the Departments of State and

place in New York        National security and  in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount and I have made security at New York s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate  However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact of this proposal on tourism and the regional economy  I would urge that your departments consider this proposal very carefully and take into account the very real concerns of the business and residential communities along New York s Northern Border        According to the Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Partnership   representing nearly 3 000 employer members  a passport for entry to the U S   will devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border   The Partnership notes that  in 2003  there were 3 8 million visits from Canadians to New York State  an increase of 70  over 2002  Those Canadians spent over  392 Million  US  in  New York  Moreover   major tourism developments  such as the over  100 million Bass Pro Project in Buffalo  are being planned based  in part  on the substantial buying power of Canadians in Metro Toronto and Southern Ontario  The Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres are dependent upon ticket sales to fans from Southern Ontario who have the option of watching the games on television rather than in person         The North Country of New York would also feel a profound impact  According to the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce and its thousands of members   to require passports  or NEXUS cards where available  for U S  and Canadian citizens to cross the U S  Canadian border      will substantially discourage crossborder travel  and  will depress travel and economic benefit  for both nations        I remain committed to fighting for the resources necessary to make our Northern Border as secure as possible while at the same time protecting the commercial  tourist and personal traffic that is so important to New York s Northern Border Communities        To begin with  we must ensure that the offices at the border are adequately funded to provide ample staffing and to implement technological advances at the earliest possible time  The Northern Border has traditionally not received enough federal resources or attention  I have long urged the appointment of a Northern Border Coordinator who would have primary responsibility for northern border issues  Through large annual increases in border patrol agents and other initiatives  I am convinced that it is possible to enhance border security  while facilitating the binational trade and tourism between Canada and the U S  that so many of my constituents depend on for their livelihood        Based on the immediate and dramatic response of New Yorkers to the announcement of your initiative  it is imperative that your departments listen closely to the voices of my constituents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce        I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and respectfully request an immediate briefing for my staff on the full details of your proposed initiative        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton            ,0

our states face the arduous task of rebuilding  As our state and local governments have begun to calculate their various losses and needs  it is clear that the magnitude of this disaster will require action from the federal government beyond the Stafford Act  Every time a region of our country has been affected by a major disaster we have come together to make sure states do not face disasters alone   These tornadoes  storms  and flooding have affected nine states across the central United States  While each state has unique types of damage  we have joined together in an attempt to ensure

in the recovery process  Our states have provided the Committee with very initial estimates of funds that will be needed  beyond what FEMA and the Stafford Act will cover  to begin this process  The

                       Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illnesses  with Numbers Rising   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Students  and Other Individuals                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  and Robert Menendez  along with Representatives Jerrold Nadler  Carolyn Maloney  and Vito Fossella today announced that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have approved an additional  108 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  The money builds on the  50 million that was provided in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that was signed into law earlier this year  bringing total funding for the year to  158 million    The latest funding increase includes  51 5 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill and  56 5 million in additional emergency spending  The bill  having been approved by the House Senate Appropriations Committees  will now return to both chambers of Congress for final passage  whereupon it will be sent to the President for his signature    The terrible tragedy of September 11th continues to affect New Yorkers  from heroic first responders who rushed into the toxic cloud to search for survivors and have now become victims themselves  to residents who became ill even as they tried to rebuild the fabric of lower Manhattan  I am proud to have stood with them for six years as the lasting health effects of the terrorist attacks became clearer and clearer  Todays announcement marks another step toward addressing these enduring wounds  Senator Clinton said  I strongly urge the President to abandon his veto threat  The New Yorkers and first responders from across the country who answered the call in our time of need have suffered enough and dont deserve to be caught in the middle of a political squabble    I urge the President to rescind his veto threat against this essential funding  which will enhance medical monitoring and treatment for our heroic 9 11 first responders  More than six years after the attacks  some first responders have developed debilitating conditions and diseases that will require long term care  They did not abandon us in our time of need  and we must not abandon them  I am heartened that this additional funding has been set aside for their treatment  and will press the fight for every dime needed to get this job done right  Senator Schumer said    First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero  I urge the President to rethink his irresponsible veto threat so these heroes can get the treatment they deserve  said Senator Lautenberg    This funding will help address the needs of all those who deserve their government s attention and resources  whether they developed symptoms in the days after 9 11 or in the years after 9 11  said Senator Menendez   We must never forget  means that the federal government cannot ignore it s duty to care for those who are suffering just because six years have passed  After a long period of federal inaction  this year Congress has begun to deliver the type of commitment that these victims of 9 11 deserve  We cannot rest until all of those who inhaled the toxic dust around Ground Zero are examined and those found to be sick are treated    This landmark funding is a tremendous step toward caring for those who  six years later   are still suffering as a result of the 9 11 attacks on our nation  said Congressman Nadler   As Abraham Lincoln said  we must care for him who shall have borne the battle   We must also continue fighting for comprehensive health benefits for all those who have become sick as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Center  whether they be first responders  local residents  office workers  or students   And we must ensure a full and proper clean up of all affected areas  so that no more innocent people will be harmed by the environmental scars of 9 11    This landmark bill would for the very first time ensure a full years funding for federal 9 11 health clinics  said Congresswoman Maloney   In addition  these funds will help provide care not only to 9 11 responders  but to lower Manhattan residents  workers and students  as well   The New York delegation worked hard to make sure that in 2008  9 11 health clinic doctors wont have to worry about keeping their doors open   I urge the President to support this funding and sign this important bill     This funding will finally provide medical monitoring and treatment to all the unsung heroes of 9 11  including 9 11 responders  area workers  residents and others  It is also an important step forward in fulfilling our responsibility to help all those who are sick today as well as those who become ill in the future  said Congressman Vito Fossella    The  108 million in new funding will go towards monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The  51 5 million portion in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill also includes statutory language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mount Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    The lawmakers said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed         ,0
1888,"U.S. PRISON POPULATION SOARS; VERMONT SPENDS MORE ON PRISONS THAN HIGHER EDUCATION
  More than one in every 100 American adults is in jail or prison, according to new research on the nation's surging inmate population. The same study also found that Vermont is one of only five states that spends more money on prisons than on higher education. 
   ""Incredibly, with over 2.3 million Americans behind bars, we now have more people in jail than any other country on Earth,"" Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said. ""In my view, these sad facts reflect a very distorted set of national priorities.
   ""Today, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country and, year after year, we grossly underfund childcare, Head Start and the overall needs of our children,"" Sanders added. ""Perhaps, if we adequately invested in our children and in education, kids who now grow up to be criminals could become productive workers and taxpayers, rather than lawbreakers and burdens on society.""
   The study of the burgeoning inmate population in the United States was conducted by the Pew Center on the States Public Safety Performance Project.
   The report said there are 1,596,127 prisoners in state and federal penitentiaries. Another 723,131 are behind bars in local jails, making the United States prison population the largest in the world. Much more populous China holds1.5 million inmates behind bars. Per capita, the incarceration rate in the United States, with 750 prisoners per 100,000 people, is ahead of Russia (628 per 100,000) and other former Soviet bloc nations.
   With more than one in every 100 American adults in jail or prison, the 50 states spent more than $49 billion on corrections last year. Over the past two decades, the rate of increase for prison costs was six times greater than for higher education spending, the report said.
   Vermont spends $1.37 on corrections for every $1 spent on public universities and community colleges, according to the study. Vermont is one of only five states that spend more on prisons than on colleges and universities, the researchers found, and the ratio is higher in Vermont than anywhere else.
   After nearly doubling in size over the past decade, the Vermont prison population will increase three times as fast as the general resident population over the next decade, at a cost of between $82 million and $206 million, according to a separate study released last month by the Council of State Governments Justice Center.

1167,February 15  2005 Senator Clinton Meets With Army Corps of Engineers to Push for Action on Long Island Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator calls for action on Tiana Beach erosion  Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study and Long Island Sound Dredge Management Plan  NY Corps head pledges to work with Senator Clinton to get the results Long Island deserves                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today met with Colonel Richard J  Polo  Commander of the New York District of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  to press for action on a number of major environmental issues effecting Long Island         During the meeting  Senator Clinton requested that the Army Corps respond immediately to the erosion problems at Tiana Beach in Southampton  Specifically  the Senator requested that the Corps send representatives to the County s February 17th meeting with elected and regulatory officials and provide whatever technical and other resources they can to respond to this emergency  In addition  Senator Clinton asked that the Corps update the Breach Contingency Plan to reflect current conditions in order to be better prepared for any future breaches  In the meeting  Col  Polo agreed to send representatives to the meeting and to do everything possible to expedite the emergency permit needed to enable sand to be placed on the beach         At the meeting  Senator Clinton also stressed the importance of restoring funding for the  Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study   Last week  Senator Clinton strongly criticized the Bush Administration s budget for abandoning the Army Corps of Engineers  study of the shoreline from Fire Island to Montauk Point  The President s budget for Fiscal Year 2006  released last Monday  eliminates funding for the study for the second year in a row  Last year  when the President s FY 2005 budget also zeroed out the study  Senator Clinton worked with Congressman Bishop and County Executive Levy to get the Administration to restore funding for the study  After raising the issue in a Senate hearing in March of 2004  Senator Clinton received a commitment from the Corps of Engineers in June to restore funding for fiscal year 2005  and the study was funded at  1 4 million         Finally  Senator Clinton requested Col  Polo s immediate personal attention be given to the development of a Dredged Material Management Plan  DMMP  for Long Island Sound to ensure that this important work goes forward  In 2004  Senator Clinton introduced legislation to require the Corps to create a DMMP after public outcry about an EPA proposal to designate long term dredge disposal sites in the Sound         I was pleased to meet with Col  Polo today and to raise with him some of the critical environmental issues that are facing Long Island   Senator Clinton said   From shoreline erosion to the proposal to dump dredge management in the Sound  these issues affect the lives of millions of people living on Long Island and must be addressed as soon as possible         At the meeting  Senator Clinton presented Col  Polo with a letter outlining her concerns and her requests for action  A copy of the Senator s letter is attached        February 15  2005   Colonel Richard J  Polo  Jr    Commander and District Engineer   US Army Corps of Engineers  New York District   26 Federal Plaza   New York  NY 10278 0090          Dear Colonel Polo           Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss the vital work of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers in New York State  There are several issues in particular that I would appreciate your attention to        Tiana Beach   As you are aware  the ocean beach along Dune Road in the area between Mermaid Lane and Ponquogue Bridge in Hampton Bays  Southampton has suffered severe coastal erosion as a result of past and current winter storm systems passing over the Northeast region  Yesterday  Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy declared a state of emergency for this area of the county  To develop a coordinated response  the county will host a meeting on Thursday  February 17th with elected and regulatory officials from town  county  state  and federal government  I ask that you send representatives to this meeting and provide whatever technical and other resources the Corps can provide to respond to this emergency  In addition  I ask that you update the Breach Contingency Plan to reflect current conditions so that we are better prepared for any future breaches        The Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study   As you know  the Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study is a partnership between the Corps of Engineers and other federal and state agencies to develop a comprehensive  long term plan to protect coastal areas that are prone to flooding  erosion and other storm damage  The plan would replace ad hoc measures that have been used to protect individual properties with a comprehensive management approach that considers the entire coastal system         This vital study is nearing completion  and so I was dismayed to discover last week that the President s budget for FY 2006 eliminates funding for the second year in a row  Last year  I worked to bring this short sighted decision to the attention of the Corps  and received a commitment from the Corps of Engineers in June to restore funding for Fiscal Year 2005 and 2006  The Corps made good on the first half of this promise  and the study was funded at  1 4 million in FY 2005  I urge you to work with Corps Headquarters staff to again find a way to restore funding to complete this study        Environmental Restoration in NY Harbor   I am pleased that the President s FY 06 budget includes  101 million for continued work on the New York and New Jersey Harbor Project  I trust that this level of funding is will enable the harbor deepening to continue to stay on schedule  However  I am concerned that the environmental restoration component of the harbor project is lagging behind the deepening work  and I ask that you work to ensure that this important part of the project moves forward more expeditiously        Dredged Material Management Plan   As you know  I strongly believe that a long term plan is needed to manage disposal of dredged material in the Long Island Sound watershed  To accomplish this goal  I introduced legislation in 2004 to require the Corps of Engineers to work with the states of New York and Connecticut and the U S  Environmental Protection Agency to develop a Dredged Material Management Plan  DMMP  for Long Island Sound  Therefore  I was pleased to see that Governor Pataki and Governor Rell sent a letter to Lt  General Carl Strock on February 8  2005 asking him to begin developing a DMMP for the Sound  Development of a DMMP that includes alternatives such as reducing sediment sources  reducing contaminant loading  and developing beneficial reuses is critical for the health of the Sound  I request that you give the DMMP your personal attention  and see that work begins as soon as possible         Sincerely          ,0

Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and Congressman Don Manzullo  R IL  today asked President Bush to declare Winnebago County and Stephenson County a federal disaster area after severe flooding hit the area earlier this month  Durbin  Obama and Manzullo made their request in a letter to the President today   In the letter  the Illinois lawmakers supported Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request last night for federal disaster assistance   The Illinois Emergency Management Agency is now coordinating the state   s efforts       We are writing in support of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request for a major disaster declaration for Winnebago County and Stephenson County as a result of flooding beginning August 7 and continuing through August 8  2007     the Illinois members wrote      We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of Winnebago County and Stephenson County can receive federal disaster assistance     If the state   s request for federal assistance is approved  communities could apply for Individual Assistance and Hazard Mitigation Assistance   Individual Assistance includes aid to individuals and households which can include cash grants to help with temporary housing  home repairs and replacement  and other disaster related costs   Hazard Mitigation Assistance includes funding for measures designed to reduce future losses to public and private property    Hazard mitigation opportunities are assessed in most situations   Additionally  small business administration loans can be provided under an    SBA disaster assistance    declaration by the SBA Administrator even if the President denies the major disaster declaration and includes three types of loans to qualified homeowners and businesses   home disaster loans to homeowners and renters  business physical disaster loans to business owners and economic injury disaster loans to small businesses and small agricultural cooperatives   A federal disaster declaration includes SBA assistance under the Individual Assistance program at FEMA   text of letter below   August 22  2007 President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500 Dear Mr  President  We are writing in support of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich   s request for a major disaster declaration for Winnebago County and Stephenson County as a result of flooding beginning August 7 and continuing through August 8  2007    Preliminary assessments indicate that homes and businesses located in the path of the rapidly rising flood water in the City of Freeport in Stephenson County and the Village of Cherry Valley and the City of Rockford in Winnebago County received the most severe impacts of the flash flooding   These homes and businesses sustained structural damage to basements  foundations  and first floor living areas   The electrical  heating  air conditioning and ventilation systems in hundreds of homes sustained major damage   Governor Blagojevich declared Winnebago County a disaster area on August 7  2007 and declared Stephenson County a disaster area on August 8  2007    The damage assessment found that 820 single or multi family homes were impacted by the floodwaters  many sustaining major damage   Specifically  245 single family homes and 52 multi family homes were affected by floodwaters  73 single family homes and 43 multi family homes sustained major damage  and 274 single family homes and 121 multi family homes suffered minor damage   Twelve single family homes were destroyed  This is the second time in eleven months that the same area in Winnebago County  primarily in the City of Rockford  has been devastated by a flash flood   Governor Blagojevich   s request for disaster assistance regarding the previous flood and his subsequent appeal were denied   As the community is still struggling to recover from last year   s Labor Day flash flood  the need for federal disaster assistance is greater      We respectfully request that you make the necessary declaration so that the residents of Winnebago County and Stephenson County can receive federal disaster assistance   Specifically  we support the Governor   s request for Individual Assistance  including the Individuals and Households Program  and Small Business disaster loans   We also support the request for Hazard Mitigation Assistance for all counties statewide   We thank you in advance for your timely consideration of this important request and stand ready to assist in any appropriate way  Sincerely     Richard Durbin  United States

                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   More than four years after 9 11  hundreds of members of the National Guard who served at Ground Zero after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center will finally receive full federal retirement credit for their service  The final version of the FY06 Defense Authorization bill  H R  1815   which successfully passed the House of Representatives this week  includes a provision to provide the retirement credit        Senator Hillary Clinton  NY  and Reps  Carolyn Maloney  NY  and Peter King  NY   who have helped lead the effort to secure the retirement credit  today praised the Congressional action to correct this problem  Senator Clinton and Reps  Maloney and King  NY   with other members of the New York delegation  had introduced legislation in the Senate and House award retirement credits for National Guard service in response to 9 11                                 I m delighted that Congress accepted our arguments for those brave men and women of the National Guard who gave their all after the September 11th attacks   said Senator Clinton  who as a DoD Authorization conferee lobbied the joint Senate House conference to have the legislation included in the final version of the FY 2006 Department of Defense Authorization Bill   In the aftermath of 9 11  we relied on the members of the New York National Guard to help protect sensitive sites throughout the State  and they continue to play a crucial role in our homeland security  With this legislation  we are insuring that Guard members who served at Ground Zero  often for extended periods  will be awarded federal retirement credits          With this action  we have righted one of the obvious remaining wrongs left over from 9 11   said Maloney   The National Guard was integral to the security and rescue effort in lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks  and they deserve full retirement credit for their heroic work  I am very appreciative of my colleague from New York  Congressman McHugh  for his hard work on this in the Armed Services Committee  and I also thank Congressmen Hunter  Skelton and Snyder from the committee for their understanding and action on this issue  I am proud to have worked closely with my friend Peter King to achieve this victory          It is fundamentally unfair that soldiers from the same Battalion are being compensated differently for their September 11th related service   said King   Providing federal retirement credits to all members of the National Guard who served in disaster area after September 11th is simply the right thing for Congress to do         Background        Several hundred soldiers from the National Guard who responded to the World Trade Center site after the September 11th terrorist attacks have not received the military retirement benefits they deserve  Many of the soldiers who guarded Ground Zero after the attacks were not officially put on federal active duty  As a result  they did not receive federal military retirement credit for their more than 300 days of service  Other soldiers from the same unit were activated under federal duty to help secure the U S  Military Academy  and have received the appropriate retirement credit  Clearly  all National Guard troops who served during this unprecedented national emergency deserve equal status        Many of the same soldiers who protected New York after 9 11 are now serving courageously in Iraq  Sixteen members of the Manhattan based 69th National Guard Regiment have died in the Iraq war   eight in the past year alone  In April  six members of the 69th Regiment were awarded Purple Hearts after being wounded in Iraq by roadside bombs         The legislation that passed today provides all National Guard soldiers who performed full time State active duty service on or after September 11  2001 and before October 1  2002  in support of a Federal declaration of emergency following the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11  2001  with federal military retirement credit for that time served in the following covered disaster counties   1  In the State of New York  Bronx  Kings  New York  boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan   Queens  Richmond  Delaware  Dutchess  Nassau  Orange  Putnam  Rockland  Suffolk  Sullivan  Ulster  and Westchester   2  In the State of Virginia  Arlington        Joining

1247,April 16  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on USDA to Respond to Widespread Concerns Over Nationwide Honeybee Decline

                   Bee Colonies in New York State and Elsewhere Experiencing Rapid and Serious Collapse      Colony Collapse Disorder  has Potential to Impact New York s Honeybee Industry and Other Crop Production Such as Apples                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is expressing serious concerns over the rapid decline in honeybee colonies in New York State and nationwide  Joining a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in a letter to U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Mike Johanns  Senator Clinton is asking the Secretary to provide answers on how the USDA is planning to address the increasingly threatening  colony collapse disorder   which has decimated bee colonies throughout the United States           The reports of this disorder demand a swift response to identify the causes of the problem that threatens to not only impact our bee and honey growers but our fruit growers as well  We must determine the appropriate response to restore the health of our beekeeping industry   said Senator Clinton   New York farmers know how crucial our agricultural economy is to our statewide economy  This disorder poses a serious threat to our farmers  our agricultural communities and our economy  We must act quickly to preserve and promote our beekeeping industry           Colony Collapse Disorder  CCD  is a new and unexplained condition that has caused some beekeepers to lose as much as 90 percent of their honeybee colonies  The enormous importance of honeybees  responsible for providing pollination to vital crops like apples  is valued at upwards of  14 billion nationally  according to a recent study by Cornell University           The effects of CCD are just as prevalent in the state of New York  According to New York honeybee producer James Doan  there have been reports of severe losses in colonies  with many losses being reported of close to fifty percent  and some beekeepers reporting losses of nearly eighty percent  Critical to New York s apple production  Doan reported in his testimony before a U S  House Committee earlier this year that there are concerns that the loss of bee colonies here in New York will not be able to be remediated in time for apple pollination  Some estimates have shown that nearly all the major beekeepers in the state of New York have lost more than 30 percent of their colonies to CCD          In their letter to Secretary Johanns  the Senators called on the Secretary to expedite a report on the steps the Department is and will plan to be taking to determine the causes of CCD  and to develop appropriate responses for the serious disorder  The Senators asked for an explanation as to how the Department plans to use its existing resources to work with other third party research enterprises to combat CCD and to outline the Department s long term plans to restore the health of the beekeeping industry across the United States          The full text of the Senators  letter to Secretary Johanns is as follows          The Honorable Michael Johanns  Secretary  U S  Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue SW  Washington  D C  20250 0003      Dear Mr  Secretary       America s beekeepers and their bees are an indispensable pillar of U S  Agriculture  Our nation s beekeepers provide essential pollination services for over 90 different food  seed and fiber crops  contributing over  14 billion of added agricultural value as documented by a Cornell University study in 2000  Crops that depend upon or benefit from honey bee pollination include alfalfa  almonds  apples  avocados  blueberries  cantaloupes  carrots  cherries  citrus  cotton  cranberries  kiwis  plums  pumpkins  seed crops  soybeans  squash  sunflowers and watermelons          As you are no doubt aware  a new and unexplained condition known as Colony Collapse Disorder   CCD   is decimating bee colonies through the United States  CCD is causing some beekeepers to lose upwards of 90 percent of their bee colonies  and is causing serious reductions in the supplies of bees for essential commercial pollination  These severe losses are in addition to other problems such as higher production costs  mite infestations and unfairly traded imports that have been making it very difficult for beekeepers to operate profitably  If these alarming trends are allowed to continue  they will place at risk in excess of  14 billion in annual U S  farm output that depends on bee pollination  Ultimately  the shortage of pollination services could impact the supply of healthful and affordable food for U S  consumers          We are writing on an urgent basis to ask that you provide us with an expedited report on the immediate steps that the Department is and will be taking to determine the causes of CCD  and to develop appropriate countermeasures for this serious disorder  In particular  we ask for a specific explanation of how the Department plans to utilize its existing resources and capabilities  including its four Agricultural Research Service honeybee research labs  and to work with other public and private sector enterprises in combating CCD  We also request that the Department identify any additional resources and capabilities that would be necessary or useful in its efforts to stop the spread of CCD          In addition  we would also ask that you outline the Department s long term plans to help restore the health of the U S  beekeeping industry  including implementation of a crop insurance program for beekeepers that Congress authorized in 2002           We look forward to receiving your report and any recommendations on this urgent matter for U S  agricultural producers and American consumers          Sincerely          ,0

926,September 12  2005 Clinton Calls for Investigation Into Misuse of 9 11 Small Business Funds

                      Report showed that 9 11 funds were given to businesses that were not affected by the September 11th attacks

                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on the Small Business Administration to investigate reports that funds meant to help small businesses recover from the September 11th attacks were used for other purposes  A recent report discovered that several loans made under the Small Business Administration  s Supplementary Terrorism Activity Relief  STAR  program were given to businesses    including a South Dakota country radio station  a Virgin Islands perfume shop  and a Utah dog boutique     not affected by the events of September 11th         In a letter sent to SBA Administrator Bareto  Senator Clinton called for an immediate investigation into the situation  The Senator also called for an investigation into reports that the SBA had encouraged banks and other lenders to use the STAR program   liberally    and offered advice on how to qualify loan applicants for the program even if they could not meet the specified criteria           At a time when many New York small businesses are indeed still recovering from the disruptions caused by the attacks of September 11th  these reports of abuse of the STAR program and the profligate use of scarce government resources are indeed inexcusable     Senator Clinton said in her letter         A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached        September 9  2005       Mr  Hector V  Barreto  Administrator  Small Business Administration  409 Third Street  S W   Washington  D C   20416       Dear Mr  Barreto        It has come to my attention that loans administered through the Small Business Administration  s Supplementary Terrorism Activity Relief  STAR  program may have been used for purposes other than assisting businesses affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11th  2001  as specified under the FY 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations Act           Recent news reports have outlined instances in which recipients of loans through the STAR program were not affected by the events of September 11th including    a South Dakota country radio station  a Virgin Islands perfume shop  and a Utah dog boutique       In fact  in one instance  a recipient of a STAR loan was not even aware that the loan was administered through the program   As troubling as these examples are  I am particularly concerned by the reports that the Small Business Administration  SBA  itself had encouraged banks and other lenders to use the STAR program   liberally    and offered advice on how to qualify loan applicants for the program if they could not meet the specified criteria         I therefore urge to you to conduct a comprehensive review of the STAR program and make a report to Congress with your findings as expeditiously as possible   In particular  I believe that questions relating to the administration and marketing of the loan program  the administrative requirements placed on lenders by the SBA to ensure that loan recipients were indeed affected by the attacks of September 11th  and the reports of SBA involvement in assisting lenders to circumvent the requirements of the STAR program need to be adequately and thoroughly addressed   Moreover  given that it has been estimated that fewer than 11 percent of these loans have been made to businesses in New York City and Washington  D C   Ground Zero for the attacks of September 11th  I also believe that an analysis of the geographic distribution of these loans is in order given that that would be one of the determinative factors in the granting of these loans         I am a strong supporter of the mission of the SBA  and indeed  many of my constituents have benefited through the services and assistance provided by your agency   Nevertheless  I believe that these reports  if true  constitute a breech at least of the spirit of the law that created the STAR program   At a time when many New York small businesses are indeed still recovering from the disruptions caused by the attacks of September 11th  these reports of abuse of the STAR program and the profligate use of scarce government resources are indeed inexcusable        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter  and I

October 26  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Max Gleischman  DURBIN  Blackwater May Have Misclassified Workers  Cheated American Taxpayers WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent a letter to U S  Treasury Secretary Henry M  Paulson asking for a full investigation and audit of how Blackwater USA classifies its workers  Initial investigations into this issue by House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman suggest that Blackwater has classified workers as independent contractors so as to avoid paying payroll taxes  which could deprive taxpayers of millions of dollars and shortchange employees by denying them overtime pay and workers  compensation  In September  Senators Obama and Durbin  along with Senators Kennedy and Murray  introduced S 2044  The Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act of 2007  which will close a tax loophole that allows employers to classify a worker an  independent contractor  instead of an  employee  to avoid paying employment taxes and workers compensation for their workers   It will also encourage improved enforcement of existing tax and labor laws related to worker misclassification through strengthened coordination between the Departments of Labor and Treasury  improved access to information for workers  and by establishing the right of workers to challenge their classification without fear of employer retaliation    The text of the letter is below  Dear Secretary Paulson  We are writing to ask for a full investigation and audit of Blackwater USA s practice of classifying many of its personnel as independent contractors instead of employees   As House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman recently found  Blackwater may have enjoyed an unfair competitive advantage over other contractors if its classification were incorrect  and as a result  may owe the American taxpayer millions of dollars in Social Security  Medicare  and unemployment taxes   Misclassification of workers as independent contractors is a widespread problem in our country  but it is particularly disturbing that a government contractor of Blackwater s scope may be engaged in it   According to the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   the misclassification of workers accounts for 30 40 percent of the  20 billion annual federal employment tax gap and can also lead to the loss of basic worker protections under labor law   As you may know  we introduced S  2044  the Independent Contractor Proper Classification Act  ICPC   earlier this year to improve enforcement of existing laws protecting workers from misclassification and laws ensuring that employers comply with their employment tax obligations   The legislation also modifies the Section 530 safe harbor in tax law that currently encourages misclassification and protects some employers engaged in it  The Section 530 safe harbor in tax law requires the IRS to excuse misclassification for employment tax purposes and allow an employer to continue reporting employees as independent contractors if the employer  1  has been treating similarly situated workers as independent contractors   2  has been consistently reporting the workers as independent contractors to the IRS and has been issuing 1099 s to the workers  or  3  has a reasonable basis to classify employees as subcontractors   The reasonable basis test is satisfied if the employer meets any one of the following   a  the employer reasonably relied on a court decision or IRS ruling issued to the employer   b  it was the subject of an IRS employment classification audit that did not result in any  assessment        for misclassification  or  c  it relied on a long standing practice of a significant segment of the industry  We are concerned that Blackwater may be violating the law by inappropriately classifying its workers as independent contractors   It is difficult to fathom how Blackwater employees in Iraq can be considered independent contractors   They are trained by Blackwater  paid by Blackwater  and told whom to guard by Blackwater   These are not independent small businessmen establishing their own individual working relationships with those they are hired to protect In a statement to the Associated Press  a Blackwater spokeswoman said the company has appealed an IRS ruling related to a specific Blackwater associate where the IRS determined that the worker had been misclassified    The spokeswoman further stated that the Small Business Administration  SBA  told the company that Blackwater security guards do not have to be classified as company employees   We do not believe it is appropriate for Blackwater  or any private company  to rely on the SBA for tax classification determinations either under Section 530 or any other provision of law and ask you for clarification   The Blackwater case is a perfect example of the failure of tax enforcement and the need for reform of the Section 530 provision   That provision currently bars the IRS from writing rules  regulations  or guidance on complying with the law   Without the ability to provide direction to employers and its own auditors  the IRS is left with piecemeal enforcement that  at best  creates confusion among businesses  and at worst  allows companies like Blackwater to purposefully evade the law    Our legislation is pending before Congress  and we look forward to working with you on it   In the interim  we ask that you open a full investigation into Blackwater s classification practices  Sincerely     Senator Barack Obama  Senator Dick Durbin                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1
1816,"SENS. SANDERS, LEAHY, REP. WELCH ISSUE STATEMENT ON IMPEACHMENT
  Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch issued the following statement:  
   ""As Vermont's representatives to Congress we fully understand and share the frustration and anger of Vermont legislators and many Vermonters with the Bush administration - one of the worst and most destructive in American history. 
   ""Currently, for the first time since President Bush has been in office, there are a number of investigations taking place regarding the actions of the Bush administration, including how and why we invaded Iraq, no-bid contracts, the firing of U.S. attorneys by the attorney general, the assault on constitutional rights and the use of Republican Party emails in the White House. Before we talk about impeachment, it is imperative that these investigations be allowed to run their course and we should then follow wherever the facts lead. 
   ""In the meantime, in our view, the people of Vermont want us to focus our attention on such issues as ending the war in Iraq, protecting the needs of our veterans, raising the minimum wage, addressing the crisis of global warming and providing health care to all of our citizens.""

1505,October 18  2006 Joint Statement by Senators Schumer  Clinton  and Representatives Higgins  Slaughter  and Reynolds on Expediting Major Disaster Declaration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Today the Western New York Congressional delegation released the following statement            Western New York continues to suffer from the effects of a massive snowstorm that caused thousands of homes to go without power for several days   In our visits and discussions with government officials we know the extent of the devastation and have been working to support the work being done to restore power  clean up downed trees  and ensure that government at all levels is responding with all deliberate speed   Our staffs continue participating in conference calls with the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to ensure that the federal government  s response and assistance meets the highest standards   Today  we are asking the President and FEMA to expedite the Governor  s request for a major disaster declaration for the four impacted counties of Erie  Genesee  Orleans  and Niagara so that both individual and public assistance will be available to households  businesses  and public entities  The county and municipal governments affected by this storm and its aftermath have been working hard in response to this emergency and we commend them for their efforts   We are concerned equally about those in the surrounding suburbs who await power restoration   We are asking National Grid to continue their efforts to restore power as quickly as possible   As we have said before  everyone needs to keep records so that they will be able to work with FEMA on what expenses are reimbursable by the federal government   The people of Western New York are strong and resilient   We stand with you in this time and are working to make sure everyone receives the right information and assistance   Much progress has been made to date but more must be done   As your Congressional delegation we will do everything in our power to make sure that both the short and long term recovery efforts continue to help every one of our citizens             ,0
733,July 10  2006 Senator Clinton s Letter to Constituents on the Accomplishments of the 109th Congress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dear Friend          As we wrap up the second session of the 109th Congress  I want to take this opportunity to share with you just some of the progress we have made for New York this past year  Recently  you expressed an interest in learning about my work in the Senate  I am pleased to offer this broad look at the previous year s initiatives and achievements           At a time when we face great challenges to our economy  our security  and our values  we have made strides for our state  I am proud to have worked on your behalf  every single day  When traveling throughout New York   I am always heartened by the hope and optimism of New York  s families  Having spoken with many of you about your concerns  I have worked hard in the Senate to honor my duty to you  to represent the interests of all New Yorkers  I am proud of all that we accomplished and remain hopeful that we will continue to achieve great things for our state         Securing our Economy  Protecting our Communities Investing in Education  Strengthening our Health Care System and Improving Public Health Preparedness   Standing Up for Seniors Promoting Energy Independence   Standing with our Armed Forces and Veterans  Standing up for Children and Families       Securing our Economy     Working together  I firmly believe that our state can compete and succeed in the 21st century economy  Joining with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  I have stood up for an economy that works for people by promoting small businesses  manufacturing  agriculture  and tourism  by seeking federal investment in infrastructure  and by forging new economic partnerships between the public and private sectors  businesses large and small  investors  and young people looking for good jobs in our communities        Agriculture  Together with New York States growers  distributors  retailers  restaurateurs  and others  we are expanding access to markets for New York  s agricultural products  particularly in downstate regions such as New York City   That is the goal of my  Farm to Fork  initiative which has continued to develop this year  We continue to make the connections needed to support our farmers and rural communities  to develop new institutional markets such as schools and colleges  and to make healthy  locally grown food more accessible to all children and communities           Last summer  for example  I launched with FoodLink a regional distribution center that helps local farmers in the Finger Lakes and Greater Rochester Region reach broader markets  For small farmers   and for local businesses looking to buy local produce   the lack of an effective distribution network was a challenge  and FoodLink will help farmers overcome that challenge  I also continue to promote value added opportunities for our New York state producers  such as organic agriculture  and was pleased to co host an organic workshop for farmers  educators  and extension agents at Alfred State College in Western New York this past spring  We also convened a meeting in the Hudson Valley with representatives of private colleges and universities to promote New York agriculture           In Washington   I continue to work with my Senate colleagues to fight for federal programs and legislation that provide critical safety nets for our New York producers  I fought hard to extend the Milk Income Lost Contract  MILC   which was extended until the next farm bill  and strongly opposed the milk tax on dairy farmers that the Administration proposed at the beginning of this year  I have also been a strong advocate for full funding of programs that will help improve the competitiveness of our specialty crop growers  In addition  I will continue to urge the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to provide the needed disaster assistance when natural calamities hit  such as the recent flooding in the Southern Tier and Central New York         Alternative Minimum Tax  Once again the Congress enacted a temporary fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax  or AMT  which is affecting more and more middle class families and leading to unexpected and unfair tax burdens   While a long term solution is needed  our AMT  patch  will prevent some 2 9 million New York taxpayers from being caught by the AMT        Infrastructure  In March of this year  I joined with a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2006  legislation to address the deteriorating conditions of our nation s roads  bridges  drinking water systems  dams  and other public works  The bill would create a National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States   charged with investing in infrastructure to meet current demands and the demands of future economic growth  In fact  the American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated that we confront a  1 6 trillion need for infrastructure improvements  In addition  last year we passed into law a transportation bill that will bring over  16 billion to New York State to meet our growing highway and transit needs over the next several years  For the future of New York  s economy and communities  we must invest in our roadways  bridges  buses  tunnels  ferries  and transportation infrastructure        Manufacturing  Joining with my colleague  Senator Lindsey Graham  we created the Manufacturing Caucus  to draw attention to challenges facing manufacturers in New York and around the country and to develop policies that will ensure America  s continuing competitiveness in the global economy  Two recent Manufacturing Caucus meetings have focused on the relationship between the defense industry and manufacturing and on the need for continued investments in research  development  and education to sustain the strength of American manufacturing  Good paying manufacturing jobs helped create a strong and vibrant middle class in America and ensuring the strength of the manufacturing sector in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive economy is crucial           As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  I have been pleased to advocate for New York  s defense industry and this past year we were successful in securing tens of millions of dollars for New York  s first rate defense companies        New Partnerships  To foster good jobs  promote our businesses  and keep economic growth right here in our state  I have continued to work closely with a private sector venture called New Jobs for New York   This not for profit effort  which I have supported from its inception and continue to support as chair of its advisory board  brings New York  s investment dollars to entrepreneurs and small businesses across our state  So far  this partnership has joined more than 275 New York businesses with investors through ten conferences and connected more than 3 400 entrepreneurs  investors and researchers from across New York   New Jobs for New York also works to connect our state s young people with career opportunities  so that our talented students realize their potential in our communities  We have recently held a conference on emerging technology on Long Island  a telecommunications summit in Albany   and an event to promote Rochester and New York State as a renewable energy leader  We also held a collegiate job and internship fair in Syracuse   making the connections that we hope will keep our young people right here in New York            Also  in December  education institutions  non profit organizations  and local businesses gathered at Schenectady County Community College to discuss how we can continue to develop the world class workforce necessary for the Tech Valley   For several years  working with local companies  organizations  and community leaders  we have opened up new markets to small businesses through trading cooperatives that help entrepreneurs sell their products online  We continue to expand the Finger Lakes Trading Cooperative to additional counties and our trading cooperative in the North Country continues to add entrepreneurs and local companies        Protecting Privacy  A concern that many New Yorkers have expressed to me more and more frequently is their privacy   and the risks to privacy posed by a more interconnected  information driven economy  That is why I will introduce a Privacy Bill of Rights   comprehensive legislation designed to protect privacy rights and guard against identity theft  Individuals ought to have the right to know and correct information being kept about them  the right to know how their information is being used by private companies  and the right to hold the public and private sectors to the highest standards of care with personal data and information        Raising the Minimum Wage  I also believe that Congress should stand up for an economy that works for people  That is why I have continued to call for an increase in the minimum wage   which has not been raised for nearly a decade  In that time  members of Congress have raised their own salaries by tens of thousands of dollars  My legislation  the Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act  would make sure that  if members of Congress get a pay increase  so do minimum wage workers        Small Businesses  I have supported legislation that allows small businesses to immediately expense up to  100 000 in equipment and capital investments   We also saved the Small Business Administration s Program for Investments in Microentrepreneurs  PRIME   which provides training and technical assistance to low income entrepreneurs   Last year  this critical program which serves many small businesses throughout New York was eliminated in the President s budget   We fought to include  2 million for this program and we will be working to ensure that this program is funded again this year         Return to top   Protecting our Communities     As your Senator  I believe my most important responsibility is working to secure our nation and to keep our communities safe  Since September 11th  2001  we have come to understand new dangers but we must do more to make the investments in security that these new dangers require  which includes protecting against and preparing for disasters   both manmade and natural           Late last year  the Congress passed  250 million for the E 911 grant program  to upgrade and improve our nation s emergency communications system  In New York   over half of the 911 calls placed each year are made on cell phones  Unfortunately  many towns and cities in New York and throughout the country lack the technology to pinpoint the location of these calls  These funds will be dedicated to grants that will enhance emergency communications services through planning  infrastructure improvements  equipment purchases and personnel training   vital in the post 9 11 world           I have also introduced legislation to ensure that our first responders have an interoperable emergency communications system coordinated under federal leadership   Nearly five years after September 11  our emergency communications systems are still unprepared for the realities of a crisis   My bill will close this gap in our preparedness and make sure first responders on the ground from different jurisdictions are using compatible communications technology and receive the technological  logistical and financial support from the federal government necessary to address this priority           I also continue to fight for threat based funding so that our homeland security dollars are distributed based on the facts on the ground instead of politics in Washington   Sadly  often our progress these days is gauged by the bad decisions we prevent  we must continue to fight the misguided cuts to the Homeland Security Grant Program proposed by the Department of Homeland Security that would slash funding for New York            Over the past twelve months  I have also called for tighter controls on nuclear materials  introduced legislation to block foreign governments from controlling United States ports  and continued to fight for a real commitment to security at our ports and railways  In May of this year  for instance  I joined a bipartisan coalition of senators to introduce comprehensive transportation security legislation  it has been almost five years since the devastating attacks of 9 11 and  sadly  we still do not have an adequate and comprehensive approach to homeland security  I fear we are leaving our ports  our rail systems  and our cities open to great risk   and we must fight for the safeguards necessary to protect against that risk           I also believe that an important part of defending our communities is supporting the first responders who truly are on the front line of our defense  In September of last year  I introduced with several colleagues legislation to provide free medical screenings to first responders  volunteers  and emergency personnel who respond   at great personal risk   to disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the terrorist attacks of 9 11           Joining with New York  s other Senator  Senator Charles E  Schumer  and House members from both sides of the aisle  we were able to restore  125 million for injured 9 11 workers  Those funds had been approved as part of the emergency recovery aid passed in the aftermath of the attacks  but President Bush had proposed to take back the promised funding  That was unacceptable  and  working together  we reversed the decision           We all saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina the challenges that remain in effectively responding to crises and emergencies  The response we all witnessed along the Gulf Coast was unworthy of America and I believe it is my duty  as your Senator  to stand up and demand answers  These many years after September 11  2001  all Americans had every right to expect better  In September of 2005  and in recent months  I have called for the creation of an independent national commission  modeled on the 9 11 Commission  to investigate what went wrong in our response and how we can make it right  I also introduced a bill to create that commission and to restore the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA    our nation s emergency response agency   to its rightful place as an independent  cabinet level agency that reports directly to the President of the United States           Finally  with my colleagues in the House and Senate  we have worked hard to ensure that FEMA is responding to the needs of people in the Southern Tier  the Mohawk Valley   the Catskills  Central New York   and other upstate communities that have lost homes  businesses  and face other hardships as a result of severe flooding  It is imperative that the federal government provide the necessary resources to get people the help they need as quickly and efficiently as possible so that their homes  farms  businesses  hospitals  and other facilities can be repaired or rebuilt  and lives can go on  I have spoken with many local officials and people who have been directly impacted by the flooding  and have promised to do whatever is in my power to make sure no one is left behind  So many New Yorkers deserve our praise for their hard work and dedication in the immediate aftermath of these floods and for those who have been directly affected  my office and I will continue to be available to you in the difficult weeks and months ahead         Return to top   Investing in Education     In November of last year  I introduced the Investing for Tomorrow s Schools Act of 2005  Too many children are struggling to learn in overcrowded and deteriorating schools with leaking roofs  dangerously outdated ventilation systems  and other serious structural problems  Unless we invest in helping states and financially strapped school districts repair and modernize crumbling schools  these problems will only get worse and more expensive to fix  The act would provide immediate aid to the neediest schools and help fund affordable construction far into the future  New York has a greater need for repairs and renovation than any other state   estimated at  51 billion  In New York City alone  where schools on average are 61 years old  schools are estimated to need  21 billion in repairs  I will continue to fight for this legislation  every child deserves a safe and enriching place to realize his or her dreams and develop skills necessary to be competitive in the fast paced global economic climate           We also have to do more to stand with students seeking higher education  That is why I introduced the Non Traditional Student Success Act  a comprehensive bill to help students who are attending college while raising children and or working while studying   This legislation would make Pell Grants available year round  boost awareness and information about available financial aid  and provide financial aid to students who are attending school part time  In December of 2005  Congress passed legislation that included much of the act  fixing the definition of student costs so that students attending school less than half the time can receive financial aid to cover room and board for up to three semesters  simplifying access to need based aid  and reducing the  work penalty  by allowing working students to keep more of their earnings without penalizing their aid           The foundation of our financial aid system is the Pell Grant  Unfortunately  the buying power of the maximum Pell Grant has declined over time  In March  I cosponsored an amendment to increase the Pell Grant to  4 500           In addition  this spring I introduced the Student Borrower Bill of Rights  The legislation aims to provide student borrowers with basic  enforceable rights  the right to affordable loan payments that do not exceed a certain percentage of a student s income  the right to real options so that students can choose what is right for them  and the right to accurate information and transparency in the loan process         Return to top     Strengthening our Health Care System and Improving Public Health Preparedness     Another important challenge   which New Yorkers increasingly share with me   is the rising cost of health care  These last few months  in fact  I have held health care forums in Rochester   in Buffalo   and on Long Island to talk about health care  and how we can address the crisis  Forty six million Americans lack insurance  including 8 million children  Millions more are underinsured  We are all affected by our broken system  when hospital emergency rooms are filled  doctors struggle to meet increasing patient loads  and families face premiums rising five times faster than incomes           One important step we should take is to harness 21st century technology to improve quality  increase efficiency  and control costs  Technology has changed the way we do business   and it can change the way we administer and deliver health care  too  The Senate unanimously passed in November bipartisan legislation that I introduced with my colleague Senator Bill Frist and others to invest in health information technology  or health IT  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would create a secure and private health IT infrastructure   to reduce errors  cut paperwork  lower costs  and improve patient care           Another step that would improve our system is making our health care system work better for small businesses  In March  I introduced legislation with a number of my colleagues to make it easier for small businesses to provide health care benefits for their employees  Small businesses are the engine of our economy  employing more than half of all private sector employees and driving economic growth  but these businesses struggle to offer health care to their employees  The Small Employer Health Benefits Program Act allows small business to join into one risk and purchasing pool   just like federal employees do   so businesses can negotiate for lower costs and offer a wider array of affordable choices to their employees           The Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee has also passed the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act  legislation to create research centers to explore the links between environmental pollutants and breast cancer  This is an issue I care deeply about  and was proud to do my part as a member of the committee  Three million women in the United States are currently living with breast cancer  one million of whom have not yet been diagnosed  On average  over 13 000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in New York State   with about 3 000 annual deaths caused by this disease           We also have to do more to prepare for public health threats  including the seasonal flu and the threat of avian or pandemic flu  Working across the aisle with my colleague  Senator Pat Roberts  I introduced legislation to fix the recurring shortages of flu vaccine and strengthen our vaccine delivery infrastructure  I have called on the Secretary of Health and Human Services  Michael O  Leavitt  to address the delivery issues and I have asked for an investigation into the communications gap with public health officials  providers  and the public about the flu vaccine supply  In October  the Senate adopted a proposal I co sponsored to increase funds to fight seasonal flu and help prepare our country for a pandemic or avian flu outbreak  In light of remaining concerns over shortages  I released a guide to help New Yorkers locate flu vaccine and have continued to urge the President and his allies in the Congress to support my legislation to improve our nation s vaccine delivery system         Return to top     Standing Up for Seniors     New York has the third largest population of older adults in the nation and as a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  I have worked to address the challenges facing New York  s seniors  I will continue to fight for the promise of Social Security  and will stand against any ideological attempt to dismantle the program           As co chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer s Disease  I have been working to address the many challenges that confront Americans with the disease  as well as the challenges facing their families  Today  about 4 5 million Americans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer s  In New York alone  it is estimated that Alzheimer s directly impacts 330 000 people  Just a few weeks ago  I joined patients  caregivers  and advocates to raise awareness about the early onset form of the disease           I have also been working hard to fix problems in the new Medicare Prescription Drug Program  Medicare Part D  Throughout the enrollment process  my office offered a guide to seniors struggling with a difficult and often confusing new system of drug plans  In December  I introduced legislation to help the most vulnerable seniors and disabled Americans in their transition to the new plans  including those who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid and were automatically moved from Medicaid to Medicare as a result of the new law  As confusion over the program grew  I stepped up my efforts  urging the administration to aid local pharmacists and beneficiaries  such as those who reside in assisted living facilities  who bear the brunt of the problems with the new system  I traveled to pharmacies throughout New York to draw attention to real people who were affected by the changes and the confusion  and I continue to support fixes that will make the program work better for seniors           The Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  of which I am a member  recently approved legislation that includes three of my initiatives that will serve New York seniors  These initiatives would foster greater access to home and community based long term care services so that seniors have greater autonomy and choice in meeting their needs  establish a national grant program so that communities with concentrations of older Americans  so called Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities or NORCs  can develop a service and support structure so more seniors can stay in the area  and address the gap in mental health services available to older Americans  who often suffer without treatment with conditions like depression and anxiety         Return to top     Promoting Energy Independence     As we have all seen these past months  energy prices pose a real challenge to our economy and to families working hard to make ends meet  I have called on the President to increase funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   especially after the price shocks that followed Hurricane Katrina  I helped to secure an investigation into price gouging to protect consumers in New York and around the country and called for legislation to protect consumers against gouging this summer as well  when many will spend time traveling on the roads           I am also working on long term solutions to meet the challenge of securing our energy future  I have proposed a series of steps to put America on the road to energy independence  to secure our economy  to safeguard our environment  and to free our hand to protect America and confront global threats  One proposal is to create a Strategic Energy Fund that will invest in new technologies  promote alternative fuels  such as biofuels  encourage conservation  and foster gains in efficiency  In the wake of historic oil company profits when many families have been struggling to afford even the daily commute  my legislation would finally ensure that these companies are part of the solution  The oil companies can either invest in alterative energy and efficiency  or invest in the fund   to help finally put us on a real path to energy independence         Return to top     Standing with our Armed Forces and Veterans     I also want to share with you what we have been able to achieve on behalf of our brave servicemen and women and our veterans  We owe a great deal to these patriotic individuals  I have met with many of these men and women  both in New York and in Iraq and Afghanistan   and they make me so proud to be a New Yorker and American  We cannot forget their sacrifice  New York contributes the fourth largest contingent of servicemen and women now in Iraq and Afghanistan           I have tried to honor their service in Congress   and am proud of what we have achieved on their behalf  My Heroes at Home Act  which will enhance support for troops transitioning back home after deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan   has passed the Senate  I am pleased to have introduced the amendment and proud to have received the support of the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  Heroes at Home will support returning men and women readjusting to work  struggling with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and other mental health issues  and confronting traumatic brain injuries  The measure also provides support and education to the family members of our returning troops  who often face their own set of challenges                     The second provision is a bipartisan amendment I introduced with Senator Lindsey Graham and others to improve retirement and TRICARE benefits for National Guard members and Reservists  Under the amendment  any Guard or Reserve member who is called or ordered to active duty or volunteers for active duty would qualify to receive retirement benefits earlier  In addition  the amendment further expands access to TRICARE  the health care available to our Guard and Reserve members  Improving health care for these men and women has long been a priority for me  In fact  last year  Senator Graham and I secured into law a provision that made all members of the Selected Reserve eligible to enroll in TRICARE  and created a separate category based on whether a Guard member or Reservist had been deployed  Reservists and National Guard members who volunteered to serve our country are playing an ever more demanding role as our nation faces new and grave threats  Our values demand that we honor these citizen soldiers with our best efforts to stand with them           The third provision would fix pay problems facing wounded soldiers  It is unconscionable that soldiers who have been injured in service to our country return home to bureaucratic mazes and problems receiving their pay  This amendment requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers  pay accounts and report back to Congress           I have also called on the army to investigate delays in providing improved body armor in response to reports that more extensive body armor for our troops in Iraq might have saved lives  I also called for a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee to investigate issues concerning body armor           In December  the Senate passed my bipartisan legislation to make available better financial education and training to members of the Armed Services  Too often  unscrupulous lenders and insurance providers seek to prey on our men and women in uniform  We need to give members of our armed services the financial knowledge they need to make informed decisions about how best to provide for their families  I am proud that the Senate has taken an important step forward in meeting this goal           We can look to other achievements as well  When the Pentagon announced their recommendations for base closures  for example  our state stood to lose several facilities and more than 1000 jobs  It was an uphill battle  but we stood together   and never gave up  A bipartisan coalition in Congress joined by local leaders and members of the community made a powerful case before the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission and fought hard to save New York s bases like the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and Rome s Defense Finance and Accounting Services facilities and prevent reductions at Rome s Air Force Research Laboratory and Stratton Air National Guard base  Now  instead of losing hundreds of jobs  New York is gaining hundreds  It was one of my proudest moments as a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee  having seen first hand on that committee the true value of top notch military facilities   That is what we have here in New York and it is heartening to learn that our leaders agree         Return to top     Standing up for Children and Families     For more than thirty years  I have been fighting for children   especially vulnerable children who  by no fault of their own  find themselves in difficult circumstances  I believe we all have a duty to these children  and I have worked hard to honor that duty in the United States Senate           In the past year  joining with grandparents from New York and across the country  we have underscored the challenges for families when children are raised by relatives other than parents  and I have called on Congress to pass my Kinship Caregiver Support Act           I have also tried to draw attention to the plight of young people  aging out  of the foster care system  often left on their own to further their education or obtain employment and housing with little or no family or community support structure           I cosponsored the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act to overhaul and strengthen our country s sex offender laws  The bill passed the Senate in May  I also co sponsored legislation renewing and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act  The bill passed the Senate last fall and became law last winter           In December  I joined with several colleagues to introduce a measure to protect children from graphic  violent  or pornographic video games  to strengthen the enforcement of video game ratings  and to put control back in the hands of parents  I am also pleased that my Children and Media Research Advancement Act  or CAMRA Act  passed a key committee in March  We ought to find out how the many kinds of media   including television  computer games  and the Internet   affect our children  and this bill will fund the research to do exactly that  On my website  http   clinton senate gov   I have published a Parent Media Guide to raise awareness about the resources and information available to parents looking to learn more about how to protect their kids in this new media environment           This past November  I was joined by Senator John E  Sununu to introduce the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act  named for a two year old Long Island boy who was killed when he wandered behind the SUV his father was backing into the driveway  Nearly every other day  a child dies in a non traffic vehicle accident  My bill will ensure that America  s cars are properly equipped with safety technology to prevent unintentional harm to our children so we can have safer cars and safer children in New York and across the country           A concern New Yorkers often share with me is the cost of housing throughout New York and the challenge of providing a good home for one s family  In April  I introduced the Federal Housing Fairness Act to increase the Federal Housing Administration  FHA  loan limits so that working families in high cost areas can use the program  The act raises the loan limit for single family homes to either the limit offered by Government Sponsored Enterprises like Fannie Mae or the median home price in the area           In June of this year  I built on the Federal Housing Fairness Act with new legislation  the 21st Century Housing Act  The act would reform and modernize the FHA  which has helped more than 34 million families realize the dream of home ownership  particularly helping first time homebuyers  low and moderate income homebuyers  and minority homebuyers  The FHA has long needed investment in personnel and technology infrastructure to remain competitive and useful to consumers  Reforming the FHA is important since it helps prevent many working families from having to seek out costly mortgages in the sub prime or predatory loan market           Last summer  I worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce the Housing America s Workforce Act  This legislation would provide incentives to increase private sector investment in housing with financial support for employees buying or renting a home and would make the benefit nontaxable so employees get the most out of employers  contributions           I am especially focused on tackling preventable environmental health issues that are affecting our children  particularly childhood lead poisoning  While we have made a great deal of progress  lead poisoning affects the health and development of more than 1 million children under the age of six nationwide  Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still over 24 million housing units in the United States that have lead paint hazards  about 1 2 million in New York State alone  We will never stop childhood lead poisoning unless we get lead out of the buildings in which children and families live  work  learn  and play  For this reason  I introduced the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act with Senators Mike DeWine  Barack Obama and Gordon Smith last year  which will provide an incentive for homeowners and landlords to safely remove lead based hazards  I joined Deputy Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Agency Roy Bernardi and Dr  Benjamin Hooks in Rochester earlier this year to highlight efforts and model programs that will enable Monroe County to be lead free by 2010         Return to top                    I am proud of what we are achieving on behalf of New York   Indeed  looking back on all we have achieved these past twelve months  I am also reminded of how far we have come as a state these past five and a half years           We have faced incredible tragedy  September 11th changed our nation and touched personally and deeply the lives of thousands of New Yorkers   and we are still working to meet the challenges of new threats and dangers  We continue to confront challenges in our economy as we grapple with a more competitive global marketplace  We also face challenges to our values in what is a rapidly changing world  We have achieved a lot as well  working together for the great state of New York   Just a few weeks ago  for example  I joined the hardworking men and women of the Southern Tier at a defense plant in Owego   New York for the ribbon cutting at the facility that will build the next presidential helicopter  It was an incredible moment  years in the making  So many worked so hard to make it happen  and I was proud to do my part as the first New York Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee           Standing there among so many enthusiastic  smart  talented  hardworking New Yorkers  I was filled with optimism  knowing that on so many fronts there are no challenges to our security  our economy  or our values that we cannot meet by working together           Sincerely           Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0

1670,June 1  2006 Senator Clinton Announces New Legislation to Help Working Families Own their Own Homes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Bill Represents the Second Phase in Clinton  s effort to Expand Access to the Federal Housing Administration  s Mortgage Program Mahopac  NY    In an address to local Chambers of Commerce  business and community leaders at a breakfast hosted by the Greater Mahopac Carmel Chamber of Commerce  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she has introduced the 21st Century Housing Act of 2006   S  3173  legislation designed to strengthen the Federal Housing Administration and increase the availability of FHA insured mortgage products across the country             The 21st Century Housing Act will provide hundreds of thousands of additional families with safe and affordable home ownership opportunities   At the same time  this proposal will help preserve a critical Federal initiative that has a strong tradition of service to low and moderate income participants by providing greater program and management flexibility  as well as stronger financial accountability     said Senator Clinton          The legislation  which represents the most comprehensive attempt at FHA reform since 1990  is the second part in Senator Clinton  s effort to help working families achieve the American dream of home ownership   After more than 70 years of existence  the FHA has helped over 34 million families realize the dream of home ownership   The FHA has been particularly effective at reaching first time home buyers  low and moderate income households and minority home buyers by providing an effective alternative to the sub prime and predatory lending market that often results in increased monthly mortgage payments of hundreds and thousands of dollars   However the FHA has been hampered by a lack of investment in personnel and technology infrastructure  and structural inefficiencies that have made it increasingly uncompetitive in many housing markets            The Senator  s bill makes several proposed changes to the structure of the FHA including               Allowing the FHA to offer loan terms up to 50 years  instead of the current limit of 30 years   This would have the effect of reducing the monthly mortgage payments and allowing families of more modest means to achieve home ownership              Providing the FHA with the flexibility to offer reduced and zero down payment products  mirroring private market practices  to reach families that have good credit but that lack the upfront cash for a down payment               Allowing the FHA to make investments in both personnel and information technology infrastructure to help meet the market demand for affordable mortgage products              Increasing the FHA  s loan limits for multifamily housing in high cost areas by 45 percent which will help create more home buying opportunities in high cost of living states like New York             Today  there are virtually no FHA loans being granted for multifamily homes in high cost areas in New York or across the nation   By increasing the number of these loans that are available and by providing this additional flexibility  more affordable opportunities will be created for those who live in areas like New York City and other parts of our state where the cost of home ownership is very high     said Senator Clinton            On behalf of more than 61 000 New York Realtors  I strongly endorse Senator Clinton  s legislation to modernize a critical link for many low and moderate income homebuyers to achieve the dream of homeownership   Whether it  s the purchase of a co op in Manhattan  a colonial in Rochester or a bungalow in Saratoga  FHA has given New Yorkers the chance to own a home and a piece of the American dream   Specifically  Senator Clinton  s bill makes thoughtful  creative and flexible additions to update FHA and prepare for the housing challenges of the 21st Century     said Gregory Connors  President  New York State Association of Realtors  NYSAR          In April  Senator Clinton initiated the first part of her home ownership effort  introducing legislation to enable home buyers in high cost of living areas to take advantage of the Federal Housing Administration loan program   Senator Clinton  s bill  the Federal Housing Fairness Act of 2006  increases the Federal Housing Administration  s  FHA  loan limits so that working families living in high cost of living states like New York can enjoy the benefits of the program   The bill ensures that the program reflects the generally higher median prices of homes that exceed the FHA loan limit             The Federal Housing Fairness Act of 2006 would raise the FHA loan limit for single family homes to 100 percent of the conforming loan limits offered by Government Sponsored Enterprises like Fannie Mae or 100 percent of the area median home price  allowing families in high housing cost areas to utilize the FHA program  While home ownership rates are at historically high levels on a national level  for many areas of the country  including many areas of New York  the advantages of a home mortgage insured by the FHA are denied because the loan limits are often smaller than the median price of a home in a high cost of living area   For example  according to the National and New York State Association of Realtors  the median home price is  446 500 in New York City   505 750 in Nassau County   413 000 in Suffolk County   550 000 in Queens   422 000 on Staten Island   395 750 in Putnam County   522 500 in Rockland County and  662 000 in Westchester County  In contrast however  under current law  the FHA loan limit is effectively  362 790  which means that working families  teachers  police officers  firefighters and other public servants are either closed out of the housing market where they work  driven into risky home purchase products or continue to make monthly rent payments  losing out on the opportunity to grow equity and family wealth

664,   Obama Calls on U S  to Stockpile Avian Flu Drugs to Guard Against Pandemic   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on U S  to Stockpile Avian Flu Drugs to Guard Against Pandemic Tuesday  August  9  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 9  2005   Obama Calls on U S  to Stockpile Avian Flu Drugs to Guard Against Pandemic   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael O  Leavitt  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today asked the Bush administration to immediately begin creating a stockpile of avian flu vaccines and antivirals sufficient to protect 25 percent of the U S  population    It has been estimated that with no vaccine or antiviral drugs  93 million Americans would be infected with avian flu  and 164 000 would die   said Obama   However  if an effective vaccine is provided to 80 percent of individuals younger than 19 years of age  the estimated numbers decrease to 6 million total cases and 15 000 total deaths  A sufficient supply of antivirals could have the same protective effect     Recent news reports indicate that the avian flu vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur may be effective in preventing the disease  However  the vaccine was only proven to be effective when administered at a high dose  which means that the 2 million vaccines doses already acquired by the government would protect only about 450 000 Americans  Similarly  the current supply of the antiviral used to prevent and treat avian flu is grossly inadequate    The World Health Organization recommends that countries maintain a stockpile of antivirals capable of treating 25  of their population   said Obama   However  between the U S  government s current stockpile and its plan to order additional doses  there are only enough treatments for 2  of the U S  population  Roche  which manufactures the drug  has stated that it could supply 13 million more courses of treatment in 2006 and an additional 70 million in 2007  if ordered by the U S  government     We must accelerate efforts to produce an effective vaccine against avian flu and stockpile enough doses of vaccines and antivirals to prevent and treat avian flu     Full text of the letter below      August 9  2005    The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary of Health and Human Services  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  Washington  DC  20510   Dear Secretary Leavitt    I am writing to urge the Bush Administration to take immediate action to prepare for and respond to a potential avian flu pandemic     Such a pandemic is becoming increasingly more likely given bird to human transmission of avian flu and the persistent and growing numbers of infected chickens and other birds around the world   The only remaining requirement for pandemic avian flu is efficient human to human transmission  and there is some concern that this may soon occur   Given the high mortality rate from avian flu among those who have contracted the virus thus far  the world would experience human suffering and death of cataclysmic proportions if immediate steps are not taken to prevent and mitigate its impact    Unlike previous pandemics  these early warnings about a potential avian flu pandemic have provided the United States with a small window of opportunity to prepare for this eventuality   In particular  we must accelerate efforts to produce an effective vaccine against avian flu and stockpile enough doses of antivirals to prevent and treat avian flu   It has been estimated that with no vaccine or antiviral drugs  93 million Americans would be infected with avian flu  and 164 000 would die   However  if an effective vaccine is provided to 80 percent of individuals younger than 19 years of age  the estimated numbers decrease to 6 million total cases and 15 000 total deaths   A sufficient supply of antivirals could have the same protective effect    I was encouraged by this week s announcement that the latest clinical trials of the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine against avian flu were successful   However  the vaccine was only effective when given in high doses  which means that the 2 million vaccine doses already acquired by the government would protect only about 450 000 Americans   I understand from news accounts yesterday that the U S  government is preparing to purchase additional doses from Sanofi            Similarly  the current supply of the antiviral oseltamavir is grossly inadequate to protect or treat the U S  population  let alone to assist efforts by our international partners    The World Health Organization recommends that countries maintain a stockpile of antivirals capable of treating 25  of their population   However  between the U S  government s current stockpile and its plan to order additional doses  there are only enough treatments for 2  of the U S  population   Roche  which manufactures the drug  has stated that it could supply 13 million more courses of treatment in 2006 and an additional 70 million in 2007  if ordered by the U S  government     But  vaccines and antivirals are not enough   More needs to be done to strengthen and expand our nation s public health infrastructure   Public health providers will play a pivotal role in training doctors and other health practitioners  delivering preventive and medical care  communicating with the public  and conducting continuous surveillance     Since any avian flu pandemic would likely begin abroad  the U S  should be working with international health organizations on assisting poor countries to purchase vaccines and antivirals and to develop a system for quickly distributing the drugs in the event of a pandemic    Over the past six months  I have pushed for   and the Senate has appropriated    35 million to assist in the fight against the avian flu   The Foreign Affairs Authorization Act  S  600   which could pass the Senate this fall  would require the establishment of an interagency task force to design and implement a comprehensive  international strategy to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   I also have introduced the AVIAN Act  S  969  which would improve domestic and international preparedness against a potential pandemic  including procuring vaccines and antivirals for a strategic national stockpile and studying the creation of an international fund to support pandemic control     To improve this country s preparedness for a potential avian flu pandemic  I urge the Administration to take a number of steps immediately    The U S  government should begin creating a national stockpile with sufficient doses of antivirals to protect 25  of the U S  population   If subsequent studies confirm the effectiveness of an avian flu vaccine  the U S  government should begin creating a national stockpile with sufficient vaccine doses to protect 25  of the U S  population   The U S  government should finalize its domestic preparedness plan to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu   The U S  government should establish an interagency task force to design and implement a comprehensive  international strategy to prevent and respond to an outbreak of the avian flu  and  The U S  government should work with international health organizations to assist other countries in purchasing necessary vaccines and antivirals     Please notify me by August 23  2005  as to what  if any  steps the Administration is taking in these areas   Thank you    Sincerely  Barack Obama              United States Senator                                   ,1
110,   Lugar and Obama Urge Destruction of Conventional Weapons Stockpiles   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Lugar and Obama Urge Destruction of Conventional Weapons Stockpiles Tuesday  August 30  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 30  2005  Lugar and Obama Urge Destruction of Conventional Weapons Stockpiles   DONETSK  Ukraine   U S  Senators Dick Lugar  R IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  called for the immediate destruction of 15 000 tons of ammunition  400 000 small arms and light weapons  and 1 000 man portable air defense systems  MANPADS  or shoulder missile launchers that are often sought by terrorists    Lugar and Obama toured the Donetsk State Chemical Production Plant  a conventional weapons destruction facility where the U S  has taken the lead in a three year NATO program to destroy the weapons   Another 117 000 tons of ammunition and 1 1 million small arms and light weapons are slated for destruction within 12 years    So far  the U S  has contributed  2 1 million to the project  and Austria  Bulgaria  Luxembourg  Lithuania  Netherlands  Norway  Slovakia  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom have contributed  1 2 million    While the destruction is ready to begin  the Ukrainian Rada  parliament  first must pass a law exempting the foreign assistance from taxation   Lugar and Obama discussed this issue with Rada Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn  Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko in meetings yesterday   All three leaders indicated they would promote action before the March 2006 parliamentary elections     The visit underscores the importance of legislation Lugar and Obama have authored that would commit additional U S  resources and expand authorities in cooperative threat reduction of conventional weapons around the world   The bill is part of the Foreign Relations Authorization Bill that is pending in the Senate and will be introduced as a free standing bill by the senators this fall     We discussed MANPADS  landmines and other very highly dangerous explosives   Ukraine has huge stockpiles leftover from previous times that are dangerous to people of this country as well as the possibility for proliferation to other countries   Lugar said    We are working to obtain funds to secure and destroy these weapons in cooperative threat reduction   We are encouraging the U S  and Ukraine to work together and to obtain more funds   We came here to see the problem and the solution with our own eyes     By the late 1980 s  75 percent of all Ukraine s industrial capacity was used to produce Soviet weaponry  including strategic weapons   In June 1996  the Nunn Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program successfully achieved the removal of all 1 240 deployed SS 19 and SS 24 strategic nuclear warheads from Ukraine     Vast stocks of conventional munitions and military supplies have accumulated in Ukraine   Some of this stockpile dates from World War I and II  yet most dates from Cold War buildup and the stocks left behind by Soviet withdrawals from East Germany  the Czech Republic  Hungry and Poland   Obama said   We need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the Ukrainian people and people around world  by keeping them out of conflicts around the world     Estimates by the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency suggest a significant proliferation and public safety threat from the 7 million small arms and light weapons and 2 million tons of conventional ammunition stored in more than 80 depots across Ukraine   These depots were never designed to hold such large stockpiles and remain vulnerable to those seeking such weapons or their components  or to spontaneous detonation in some of the older and larger ammunition stockpiles     In March  the Foreign Relations Committee added the Lugar Disarmament Initiative  LDI  to the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007   The LDI is modeled on the original Nunn Lugar Act   Its purpose is to provide the Department of State with a focused response to the threat posed by vulnerable stockpiles of conventional weapons around the world  including tactical missiles and MANPADS   Such missile systems could be used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners  military installations and government facilities in the U S  and abroad   Reports suggest that Al Qaeda has attempted to acquire these kinds of weapons   In addition  unsecured conventional weapons stockpiles are a major obstacle to peace  reconstruction and economic development in regions suffering from instability     This bill declares it to be the policy of the United States to seek out surplus and unguarded stocks of conventional armaments  including small arms and light weapons  and tactical missile systems for elimination or safeguarding   It authorizes the Department of State to carry out an accelerated global effort to destroy such weapons and to cooperate with allies and international organizations when possible   The Secretary of State is charged with devising a strategy for prioritizing  on a country by country basis  the obligation of funds in a global program of conventional arms elimination   Lastly  the Secretary is required to unify program planning  coordination and implementation of the strategy into one office at the State Department and to request a budget commensurate with the risk posed by these weapons    During the trip  the senators have inspected a nuclear warhead storage facility and missile destruction facility in Russia and biological laboratories in Russia and Ukraine   On Thursday  they will review sea interdiction exercises on the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan      In 1991  Senator Lugar  R IN  and former Senator Sam Nunn  D GA  authored the Nunn Lugar Act  which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  This program has provided U S  funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  related materials  and delivery systems  In 1997  Lugar and Nunn were joined by Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  in introducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act  which expanded Nunn Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided WMD expertise to first responders in American cities  In 2003  Congress adopted the Nunn Lugar Expansion Act  which authorized the Nunn Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats  In October 2004  Nunn Lugar funds were used for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to secure chemical weapons in Albania  under a Lugar led expansion of the program    The latest Nunn Lugar Scorecard shows that the program has deactivated or destroyed  6 760 nuclear warheads  587 ICBMs  483 ICBM silos  32 ICBM mobile missile launchers  150 bombers  789 nuclear air to surface missiles  436 submarine missile launchers  549 submarine launched missiles  28 nuclear submarines  and 194 nuclear

Troops and Their Families to Transition After Deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan Listen to Senator Clinton s remarks to veterans in Syracuse  NY      Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  today kicked off a week of continued focus on issues affecting our men and women in uniform  Visiting Veterans Affairs  VA  Medical Centers in Syracuse and Canandaigua  NY  and then visit Ft  Drum  home of the Army s 10th Mountain Division  the Senator highlighted the need to provide support to our troops and their families       Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY     Senator Clinton recently introduced a package of legislation aimed at helping U S  troops and their families to transition after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan  including             the Heroes at Home Act of 2007 to get them the help they need by improving the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expanding support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families  and           the Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act of 2007 and the Protecting Military Family Financial Benefits Act of 2007 to help ensure that wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits           When our brave men and women go to war  they should expect to be supported before they leave and be treated as heroes when they return  with the promise of adequate assistance and healthcare  That is the promise our country must keep to the men and women who enlist  who fight  and who return home often bearing the visible and invisible scars of sacrifice  This should be a time when we do more for our troops and their families  not less   Senator Clinton said          Senator Clinton in Canandaigua  NY   These bills will help our soldiers and their families if they suffer or are wounded  they will help to ensure that wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and they will help protect military family financial benefits if a loved one is deployed   Senator Clinton said   After visiting today with our brave troops and seeing firsthand what they are coping with  I am even more convinced that we must show them   not just tell them   that we are grateful for their service to our country       Senator Clinton in Canandaigua  NY     On Thursday  in Washington  DC  Senator Clinton will also attend a Joint Hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee to receive testimony on the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs disability rating systems and the transition of service members from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs          Senator Clinton s legislative package includes       The Heroes At Home Act of 2007     Senator Clinton in Washington  DC  Senator Clinton s legislation will build on the groundbreaking  Heroes at Home  initiative she authored and secured in law last year aimed at helping U S  troops and their families to transition after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan and get the help they need with readjustment to work and coping with post traumatic stress disorder and TBI       Senator Clinton in Washington  DC     Senator Clinton s new initiative will expand Heroes at Home by             Improving the screening process for our troops before deployment to improve TBI diagnoses after deployment  Traumatic brain injury  which affects approximately one out of every 10 returning servicemembers  has been identified as the  signature wound  affecting soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan  Multiple deployments and prevalent use of IEDs have put servicemembers at increased risk of sustaining more than one mild or moderate TBI  However  mild and moderate TBI may go undetected  especially if a servicemember has sustained more obvious injuries  It also can be difficult to distinguish mild TBI from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since both conditions have common symptoms  such as irritability  anxiety and depression  Senator Clinton s bill will improve detection of mild and moderate TBI by implementing an objective  computer based assessment protocol to measure cognitive functioning both prior to and after deployment  Senator Clinton s bill will require that the same assessment tool be used across all branches of the Armed Services and for every member of the Armed Forces who will be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan             Helping families struggling to take care of a loved one with training and certification for dealing with brain injuries and psychological injuries  Family members of returning soldiers with TBI are often ill equipped to handle the demands of caring for their loved one  which in some bases can become a full time responsibility  Senator Clinton s bill will establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Family Caregiver Personal Care Attendant Training and Certification Program  which would train and certify family caregivers of TBI patients as personal care attendants  enabling them to provide quality care at home and at the same time qualify for compensation from the VA             Expanding Access to Needed Care  Servicemembers and veterans continue to face problems in accessing needed medical and mental health care  especially veterans or Guard and Reserve members who live in rural areas  Senator Clinton s bill will help increase the reach of needed care for TBI by expanding use of telehealth and telemental health services  Senator Clinton s bill will create a demonstration project  administered jointly by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs that would use telehealth technology to assess TBI and related mental health conditions and facilitate rehabilitation and dissemination of educational material on techniques  strategies and skills for servicemembers with TBI           The Heroes at Home Act of 2007 is endorsed by the Wounded Warrior Project  National Military Families Association  Military Officers Association of America  American Academy of Neurology and Brain Injury Association of America        Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act of 2007     Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY  Following up on complaints she heard from New York soldiers at Walter Reed about widespread problems with disability claims  Senator Clinton today introduced legislation that will restore disability benefits for wounded and injured members of the Armed Forces  The act will direct reviews of disability claims  traumatic injury claims and the Physical Evaluation Board process  and re open cases that warrant an increased disability benefit rating or traumatic injury payment  In addition  the bill will increase the availability of legal counsel for members appealing their disability cases  and direct the GAO to investigate efforts currently being made by the Department of Defense to address deficiencies in the Disability Evaluation Systems  the adequacy of the Department of Veterans Affairs Disability Schedule for Ratings as it relates to the nature of wounds our warriors suffer in combat today  and to report on the standards and procedures of Physical Evaluation Boards       Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY  Protecting Military Family Financial Benefits Act of 2007      Senator Clinton also introduced legislation that will protect financial benefits for military family members by closing gaps in coverage for Death Gratuity and Survivor Benefits beneficiaries and improve pre deployment counseling and services for all members of the Armed Forces  Everyday single parents deploy to distant battlefields and leave their minor children in the care of a financially ill prepared guardian or caretaker  Unfortunately  when tragedy strikes and a military servicemember makes the ultimate sacrifice  minor dependent children and families are excluded from receiving benefits and entitlements  In too many cases  pre deployment systems and processes designed to protect military family financial benefits are under resourced or not available and create unnecessary burden for survivors  Senator Clinton s bill will require each military service to provide adequate pre deployment counseling and services to every deploying member of the Armed Forces to ensure that families and dependents receive survivor benefits and entitlements           These bills are supported by the Wounded Warrior Project  National Military Families Association  Military Officers Association of America  American Legion and the Gold Star Mothers           As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need  She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform  She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing  recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need  She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families                      SENATOR CLINTON   STANDING UP FOR SERVICEMEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES     Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY  As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate

servicemembers and their families cope with post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and traumatic brain injury  TBI                  To build on this initiative  Senator Clinton introduced  The Heroes at Home Act of 2007  in April to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of TBI and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with TBI and their families                 Acknowledging the increasing reliance on Guard Members and Reservists and the pervasive instances of members not medically fit to serve and lacking healthcare for themselves and their families  Senator Clinton worked to secure in law access to military health care  TRICARE  for all members of the Guard and Reserve and their families                 Anticipating the lack of preparedness to track medical problems our troops might encounter in Iraq  Senator Clinton authored legislation signed into law to improve Guard and Reserve readiness and track the health of all

effort to renew and reenergize our commitment to those who wear our uniform   to achieve a college education  to afford housing  to start a small business and more       Fighting for Adequate Body Armor         Senator Clinton has led the fight to ensure our troops have adequate body armor   Clinton called on the Senate Armed Services Committee to hold a hearing to investigate inadequate body armor being provided to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and requested a Government Accountability Office investigation to determine how the Pentagon procures body armor for our troops       Protecting Servicemembers from Predatory Insurance and Financial Practices         Senator Clinton led the fight to protect service members and their families from deceptive financial sales practices by calling for Senate Armed Services Committee hearings on the issue and for DoD to investigate the problem               Senator Clinton authored legislation signed into law to provide members of the

711,April 10  2006 Senator Clinton Introduces Bill To Enable Working Families In High Cost Of Living States To Achieve The Dream Of Homeownership                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Housing Affordability Bill Expands Access to the Federal Housing Administration  s Mortgage Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has introduced legislation to enable homebuyers in high cost of living areas to take advantage of the Federal Housing Administration loan program   Senator Clinton  s bill  the Federal Housing Fairness Act of 2006  increases the Federal Housing Administration  s  FHA  loan limits so that working families living in high costs of living states like New York can enjoy the benefits of the program   The bill ensures that the program reflects the generally higher median prices of homes that exceed the FHA loan limit               Today  we enjoy one of the highest homeownership rates in the world  but many families and many regions of the country are being unfairly left behind   The homeownership rates for African American and Hispanic households still remain below 50 percent  and working class families increasingly cannot afford to live in the places where they run our public transportation systems  protect our families and neighborhoods  teach our children  and care for our sick and infirmed     said Senator Clinton     The working families of New York should have the same opportunities enjoyed by families in other parts of the country   This bill simply reflects the higher than average housing costs in states like New York and puts an end to an unfair disparity             Senator Clinton  s bill would raise the FHA loan limit for single family homes to 100 percent of the conforming loan limits offered by Government Sponsored Enterprises like Fannie Mae or 100 percent of the area median home price  allowing families in high housing cost areas to utilize the FHA program          While homeownership rates are at historically high levels on a national level  for many areas of the country  including many areas of New York  the advantages of a home mortgage insured by the FHA are denied because the loan limits are often smaller than the median price of a home in a high cost of living area   For example  according to the National and New York State Association of Realtors  the median home price is  446 500 in New York City   505 750 in Nassau County   413 000 in Suffolk County   550 000 in Queens   422 000 on Staten Island   395 750 in Putnam County   522 500 in Rockland County and  662 000 in Westchester County  In contrast however  under current law  the FHA loan limit is only  362 790  which means that working families  teachers  police officers  firefighters and other public servants are either closed out of the housing market where they work  driven into risky home purchase products or continue to make monthly rent payments  losing out on the opportunity to grow equity and family wealth           The FHA was created during the darkest days of the Great Depression in 1934 to serve working and low income families that were shut out of the conventional housing market and to stabilize local and regional housing markets in times of economic disruption   After more than 70 years  34 million families have realized the dream of homeownership through FHA            Since FHA works as a partner with the private market  providing insurance for mortgages offered by conventional financial institutions  it is self sustaining through the income from mortgage insurance premiums paid by FHA borrowers   It costs nothing to taxpayers and has been remarkably successful in helping working families buy what is often their first home  but the program needs to be updated to reflect the economic realities in high cost of living states   Unfortunately  over the last decade  it has become increasingly difficult for families in places like New York City  Long Island  and other major metropolitan areas to participate in the FHA program       Click here for a more detailed breakdown of median home prices in New York State          ,0

                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined several of her Senate colleagues in expressing concern about extensive delays in processing and delivering passports   The delays are the result of a sharp increase in demand for passports as a result of implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI     In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  Senator Clinton and her colleagues asked that the State Department immediately develop and implement a plan to eliminate the current backlog in passport applications  immediately cease to charge unwarranted expedition and delivery fees for passports  and restore normal processing times and explain how the Department intends to deal with the potentially large numbers of people applying for passports if they continue with their plans to implement WHTI at the Northern and Southern Borders    If the State Department cant handle the volume of passport applications for vacationers  I am very concerned about how they will be able to handle the additional volume if they proceed with their requirement to provide passports at the Northern Border  Senator Clinton said    In addition to significant delays  the State Department is also charging expedition and delivery fees to applicants  despite the fact that the delays were caused by the Department itself    It is entirely unfair that the State Department is requiring expedition fees to speed up delays of their own making   Families should not be faced with inexcusable delays and hefty fees as a result of the Departments own failings  Senator Clinton said     A copy of the letter sent by Senator Clinton and her colleagues follows    June 15  2007   The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  2201 C Street  NW  Washington  DC 20520   Dear Secretary Rice    We write to express serious concerns with delays in processing passport applications that are seriously complicating  and in some cases forcing the cancellation of  travel abroad    In recent weeks  significant and increasing numbers of our constituents have contacted us for help in receiving passports due to long processing delays that threaten imminent travel plans   These travelers applied for passports well in advance of their planned travel   However  due to the large volume of passport requests associated with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   they are not receiving completed passports sufficiently in advance of their planned departure dates to complete planning for their travels   In an unfortunate and rising number of these cases  our constituents have not received their passports in time  forcing them to cancel long held travel plans and or incur significant expenses to change their plans     It is our understanding that the there are now more than 2 million passport applications pending   In fact  passport office staff are so overwhelmed that they are unable to respond to routine status requests  and have asked that inquiries be e mailed with the planned departure date in the subject line  since they are only able to work on the most urgent requests  those closest to the planned departure date   This virtually ensures that many travelers will receive their passports only at the last minute  making it impossible to make informed decisions on whether to stick with the planned itinerary  and risk having to cancel if the passport does not arrive  or to postpone the planned departure  and incur steep fees for changing the itinerary        To add insult to injury  we have recently been asked to provide constituents credit card numbers when making inquiries on their behalf  because your Department intends to charge them for expediting passport processing and for sending them their passports via Federal Express   Neither charge would be necessary if your Department were processing the original applications in a timely manner   It seems grossly unfair to charge American taxpayers extra for remedying problems that were caused by the government itself    We are not in any way casting blame on the front line employees of your agency who process passport applications   It has been our experience that they have been working long and hard to ensure that travelers receive their passports prior to planned departures   However  it is clear that they are simply overwhelmed by the sheer volume of applications resulting from the implementation of the air and ship passenger provisions of the WHTI    It is unacceptable that American citizens are missing trips because your Department did not anticipate the increase in passport applications and take appropriate action to increase processing resources   Consequently  we ask that you take the following actions    1  immediately cease to charge unwarranted expedition and delivery fees for passports    2  immediately develop and implement a plan to eliminate the current backlog in passport applications and restore normal  pre WHTI processing times  and   3  share with us your plans to ensure that a similar problem does not occur when the land border provisions of the WHTI requirements take effect  including any additional statutory authority or resources that your Department requires    Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue    Sincerely         ,0

Obama                                                                           Obama Joins Schumer and McCaskill to Call on Justice Department Watchdog to Probe Lax and Uneven Enforcement of Foreign Lobbying Law  Thursday  July 10  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT     Brian Fallon  Schumer   Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  DOJ Has Not Consistently Enforced Federal Law Requiring Disclosure of Foreign Influences on U S  Policy Democratic Senators Urge Inspector General to Examine DOJ Decision Making Behind Enforcement of Lobbying Regulations Senators Have Also Proposed Bill To Close Loophole Exempting Lobbyists For Foreign Corporations From Reporting Requirements WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Barack Obama  D IL   today called on the internal watchdog at the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to investigate the agency s spotty enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA   a federal law requiring disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign entities such as governments and political parties  The senators believe that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of FARA  allowing certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad  the senators said   Too many lobbyists are skirting the law and operating in the shadows  and in too many cases  the Justice Department is standing at the light switch  refusing to turn it on  We want answers   Schumer said   The public has a right to know when our government is being lobbied by foreign interests and the Department of Justice has a responsibility to uphold and enforce the law in all circumstances    In a place where we need more transparency  not less  lapses in enforcement of lobbying disclosure laws should not be taken lightly   McCaskill said   This is serious matter  and I expect the Inspector General to address it head on to assure the enforcers are truly enforcing the law    It is unacceptable that lobbyists can exploit loopholes to hide their lobbying contacts on behalf of foreign businesses and governments   said Senator Obama    The American people have a right to know who these individuals are representing and which American officials they re lobbying   Abusing the law to hide access and special treatment is exactly the kind of Washington culture that I ve been fighting against   I am proud to stand with Senators Schumer and McCaskill to close these loopholes  and I call on the Justice Department to immediately investigate this abuse of the law   The intent of FARA  passed by Congress in 1938  was to bring transparency to the work of lobbyists representing foreign clients by requiring the lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice  But in recent months  multiple cases have surfaced where lobbyists acting as foreign agents have either registered with the DOJ late or not at all  Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless   Senators Schumer  McCaskill and Obama today asked the DOJ Inspector General for a report on the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law  The Senators have also called on the Inspector General to take appropriate steps within the Department to look at the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General with suggestions as to how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  In June  Senators Schumer  McCaskill  and Obama unveiled legislation that would close two loopholes allowing U S  lobbyists to influence government officials on behalf of foreign clients without having to disclose their activities  The Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  would require all lobbyists representing foreign clients to register under FARA  even if they have already registered under Lobbying Disclosure Act  LDA   Under current law  lobbyists registered under LDA are exempt from also registering under the more rigorous FARA  The bill would also require that any lobbying contacts with U S  officials on behalf of foreign clients be disclosed even when they occur outside of the United States  Currently  the law only covers contacts that occur  within the United States    A copy of the Senators  letter to DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine is below     July 9  2008 Mr  Glenn A  Fine  United States Department of Justice  950 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20530 Dear Mr  Fine  It has come to our attention that there have been severe lapses in the enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act  FARA    We would like to know more about the decision making process behind FARA enforcement and whether or not enforcement has been uneven or lax over time   As you are well aware  FARA was passed in 1938 and requires disclosure of all lobbying contacts made on behalf of foreign governments  individuals  political parties  and corporations   Disclosure is important in order for the American public to know who is influencing U S  policy from abroad   Recently  we introduced the Closing the Foreign Lobbying Loophole Act  S  3123  in order to close two loopholes in the law that allow certain foreign agents to operate without the sunlight of disclosure  We believe that the requirements under FARA are clear and should be enforced in all circumstances   Violations of the disclosure law that go unpunished can undermine U S  policy and pose national security risks to the American people   Furthermore  any specter of uneven or lax enforcement can render a very important statute toothless  We know that you share our commitment to maintaining the public s trust in government   We believe that allowing individuals to break the law and operate in the dark on behalf of foreign entities will erode this trust we hold so dear   Therefore  we request an examination of the Department s enforcement record on FARA  including an analysis of all the considerations taken into account when the Department determines whether or how to enforce the law    We hope that you take appropriate steps within your Department to look into the causes of uneven or lax enforcement and provide the Attorney General or his appropriate subordinate with suggestions on how to fix any enforcement problems immediately  We also request that you transmit to us  and the appropriate congressional committees of jurisdiction  a report on your findings  We look forward to hearing from you on this matter     Charles E  Schumer    United States Senator

   Obama Introduces Resolution to Halt Rush to War with Iran Friday  November  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5566 Legislation would undo damage caused by Senate   s passage of Kyl Lieberman amendment WASHINGTON  D C      Yesterday evening  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  introduced Senate Joint Resolution 23  a legislative proposal specifying that the use of force against Iran is not authorized by any previous action of Congress   This would include the authorization of the use of force against Iraq  the recently passed Kyl Lieberman amendment  which states that our military presence in Iraq should be used to counter Iran  and any resolution previously adopted by Congress   There is absolutely no reason to trust that this Administration will not use existing congressional authorization to justify military action against Iran   said Senator Obama   The Iraq War authorization and the recently passed Kyl Lieberman amendment have opened the door to an attack on Iran  and Congress must now shut that door  We need aggressive diplomacy and economic pressure  which is why I support sanctions on Iran  Those efforts must not be linked to the use of our military presence in Iraq and the region  because we have seen what this Administration does when you trust them to do the right thing but give them an opening to do the wrong thing     Given concerns about the Bush Administration   s expansive view of executive authority  and the likelihood that any attack on Iran would come from our military presence already in Iraq and the region  this resolution is necessary to remove any suggestion that Kyl Lieberman or any other existing provision of law or resolution authorizes the President to attack Iran  Instead  the President will have to get specific statutory authorization from the Congress to use force against Iran   The text of the joint resolution is below  Clarifying that the use of force against Iran is not authorized by the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq  any resolution previously adopted  or any other provision of law  Whereas the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq  Public Law 107 243  authorized the President  to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to      1  defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq  and  2  enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq     Whereas  on September 26  2007  the Senate agreed to a provision  Senate Amendment 3017 to Senate Amendment 2011 to H R  1585  stating the sense of the Senate that     the manner in which the United States transitions and structures its military presence in Iraq will have critical long term consequences for the future of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East  in particular with regard to the capability of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pose a threat to the security of the region     Whereas  on September 26  2007  the Senate also stated the sense of the Senate  that it is a critical national interest of the United States to prevent the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from turning Shi   a militia extremists in Iraq into a Hezbollah like force that could serve its interests inside Iraq     Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of State designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  IRGC  and the Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics  MODAFL  as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction under Executive Order 13382 in relation to concerns about their role in proliferation activities  Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of the Treasury also designated 9 IRGC affiliated entities and 5 IRGC affiliated individuals  as derivatives of the IRGC  as well as Iran   s state owned Bank Melli and Bank Mellat and 3 individuals affiliated with Iran   s Aerospace Industries Organization  AIO   as proliferators of weapons of mass destruction or supporters of terrorism under Executive Order 13382  Whereas  on October 25  2007  the Department of the Treasury also designated the IRGC Qods Force  IRGC QF  as a supporter of terrorism for providing material support to the Taliban and other terrorist organizations  and designated Iran   s state owned

1786,"SEN. SANDERS SEES GREEN COLLAR JOBS IN ACTION
  Sen. Bernie Sanders toured a home construction site in Burlington where workers are learning new skills and using the latest energy-efficiency technology in a project that could be a model for ""green collar jobs"" of the future. ""As we move forward to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reverse global warming, we can create millions of good-paying jobs. But, we will not be able to move as fast as we should unless we have a well-trained workforce knowledgeable about energy efficiency technologies, as well as sustainable energy,"" Sanders said.  
   ""The goal of my workforce development legislation, which was adopted last week in the Senate, is not only to create good paying jobs, but to help people lower their energy costs. There are estimates that, properly retrofitted, the average home can cut energy consumption by 40 percent. This will mean significant saving in fuel bills.""
   The Senate this week resumes debate on an energy bill after passing an amendment by Sanders and Senator Hillary Clinton to train workers in new technologies associated with energy-efficiency and renewable energy. 
   The work site Sanders visited is a project by Burlington's Community & Economic Development Office and Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, with reconstruction work by ReCycle North, a Burlington-based non-profit organization, and technical assistance on energy efficiency by Burlington Electric Department.
   ""The young men and women who construct this housing will help relieve poverty by providing not just a house, but one that will save money on energy bills while keeping the inhabitants safe and comfortable,"" said Thomas Longstreth, executive director of ReCycle North. ""Energy efficiency must become a new engine for economic development, and Senator Sanders amendment will jump start that engine.""
   Beth Sachs, executive director of the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, said, ""The urgency of global warming impels us to move much more quickly and creatively than we have up to now. The technologies are ready, but we need a trained workforce to deliver them. This amendment bridges that gap."" 
   Bracken Hendricks, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., said ""it is time to recognize that jobs and the environment go hand in hand. We cannot have one without the other. The Sanders-Clinton Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Worker Training Program is a critically important measure that will help ensure both our energy independence and economic security as our nation builds a clean and prosperous future for all Americans.""
   Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, Public Citizen, The Sierra Club, The Union of Concerned Scientists, business organizations, the AFL-CIO, The Apollo Project and other labor groups backed the Sanders-Clinton Amendment.

291,   Landrieu  McCaskill  Obama Applaud Long Overdue Investigation of Contaminated FEMA Trailers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Landrieu  McCaskill  Obama Applaud Long Overdue Investigation of Contaminated FEMA Trailers Friday  December 21  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Scott Schneider  Landrieu   Adrianne Marsh  McCaskill   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Omnibus provision mandates investigation into Katrina tragedy WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Mary Landrieu  D LA   Claire McCaskill  D MO  and Barack Obama  D IL  lauded Congress    passage of their proposal to launch an investigation into reports that housing trailers contaminated with formaldehyde were provided to Hurricane Katrina victims   This provision  which is contained in the Omnibus Appropriations package soon to be signed into law  will initiate a long overdue investigation into why the Federal Emergency Management Administration  FEMA  failed to prevent the contamination or investigate the allegations   This provision was originally offered in July 2007 as an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill  with cosponsorship from Senators Mark Pryor  D AK   Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   John Kerry  D MA   and Tim Johnson  D SD      It is disconcerting that FEMA moved victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita into trailers with unacceptable amounts of formaldehyde     said Senator Landrieu      It is yet another example of the agency   s ineptitude   It is essential that we move forward with testing the trailers to determine how many are affected and what is necessary to move trailer residents into safe alternative housing   The language we secured in the omnibus spending bill takes this vital step to ensure that those affected by the hurricanes are being housed in a safe environment        We pay taxes so that federal government protects us during national emergencies  not to put us further in danger     McCaskill said     Not only did FEMA fail Gulf Coast residents before Katrina hit  they knowingly continued to put their lives at risk nearly two years after the fact by allowing residents to live in trailers containing toxic fumes  I   m pleased that legislation will be signed into law that will help get to the bottom of this life threatening decision so that we can prevent it from happening again      The Bush Administration s response after Hurricane Katrina was a catastrophic failure   said Senator Obama   Instead of deploying the resources required to save lives and rebuild communities  the Administration consistently cut corners and buried the truth   Lives were put at risk  and countless Americans were left homeless and without the help they needed to rebuild  We must get to the bottom of reports that this Administration may have knowingly provided contaminated trailers to those who lost their homes after this disaster   At the very least  we owe the victims of Katrina answers  and we will continue to fight to finally get them the help they have long deserved   This provision requires the U S  Inspector General to  Investigate FEMA   s policies and processes regarding formaldehyde in trailers purchased by the agency to house Katrina victims   Collect and respond to health and safety concerns of trailer occupants  and determine whether FEMA adequately notified occupants of potential health and safety concerns and whether FEMA has proper controls and processes in place to deal with health and safety concerns of those living in trailers following disasters  and  Report to Congress on its findings                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1
1428,October 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Release of Pandemic Influenza  Warning  Children at Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I am pleased to see that Trust for Americas Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics have released this report highlighting the needs of pediatric populations during a pandemic influenza epidemic  As our public health system works to prepare for both a potential pandemic and seasonal influenza  we must ensure that our efforts to protect our health extend to children as well  Our government recognizes the importance of vaccinating children against seasonal flu  but more must be done  This report highlights the ways in which our experiences with seasonal flu vaccination can impact our efforts to vaccinate children during a pandemic  The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  recommends vaccination for all children from six months to four years of age  children who have chronic diseases like asthma  and school aged children who wish to reduce the risk of becoming ill with influenza  However  influenza vaccination rates among these populations is low  with less than one out of five children receiving the recommended vaccinations  Clearly  we must do more to improve awareness of the importance of flu vaccination among pediatric populations during our annual flu season  This report also highlights some of the challenges in pandemic preparation  Much of our preparation has been focused on stockpiling antiviral medications and facemasks  In the past few years  antiviral medications have been approved for use in some  but not all  pediatric subgroups  However  we have not made such advances with masks and respirators  many of which are not designed to fit the smaller faces of children  We must ensure that pediatric formulations of medications and devices are widely available during a pandemic  I will soon be reintroducing legislation with Senator Roberts  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  that will address some of the issues in the report  in addition to helping our overall national response to seasonal influenza  This bill will improve the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide outreach to priority populations  such as young children  and improve vaccination rates among those most at risk of complications from influenza  It will also require the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that pediatric products are adequately represented in the Strategic National Stockpile  and encourage the Secretary to work with the private sector to develop treatments and devices to help protect children during a flu pandemic  With these provisions  we will be taking steps to prevent transmission of both seasonal and pandemic influenza among the tens of millions of children in our country  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to raise awareness of the public health needs in both seasonal and pandemic influenza for children  families  and all Americans         ,0
1470,July 18  2007 Senator Clinton Speaks on the Senate Floor on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered remarks on Iraq on the floor of the Senate at 4 12 am this morning as part of the debate leading up to consideration of the Levin Reed amendment  of which she is an original co sponsor      A transcript of Senator Clintons remarks is below    Mr  President  the description of the problems that are currently existing in Iraq and in the region by my friend and colleague is not only accurate  but unfortunately  an indictment of the policies of this Administration  What has been described in terms of the instability in Iraq and the consequences for further conflict are ones that I take very seriously     The issue before us now is what is the best approach that we  as a nation  can take that will fulfill our obligations to our men and women in uniform  that will make clear to the Iraqi government and people that their lives and futures are at stake  and will strengthen the hand of the United States diplomatically to deal with the consequences of the misguided policies that have brought to us this point   There are no good answers   Anyone who stands here and believes that he or she has the truth  the facts  understands both what is going on and what is likely to flow from whatever decision we take is most probably to be proven wrong by reality as it unfolds   Many of us have been searching for the best approach to take with respect to our involvement in Iraq for a number of years   But we don t do it with any sense that we know everything that will happen no matter what decisions are taken      But what we do have is a history of miscalculation and mistakes that we are now attempting to deal with  The Levin Reed Amendment attempts to put into law a new direction for Iraq  one that I and others believe is long overdue     The reason that I have come to support this amendment is because if one looks at the actions of our military in Iraq based on the authority under which they are operating  they have achieved the missions they were given  They were asked to remove Saddam Hussein from power and bring him to justice  and they did so  They were asked to provide the Iraqi people with the opportunity for free and fair elections  and they did that as well  They were asked to give the Iraqi government the space and time to make the difficult political decisions that are required in order to have any hope of stabilizing Iraq over the longer term  and they did that as well  Our military has performed not only heroically  but successfully  with courage and determination against odds and enemies from all sides     What we know is that when the people of Iraq turn against violence  there is a chance for success  That s the basis of the counterinsurgency strategy  It cannot succeed unless the people on the ground are part of the winning strategy     What has happened in Al Anbar province is an example of that  The tribal sheikhs and the people turned against the violence and extremism of the Al Qaeda factions  many of whom were led by foreign fighters who violated not just the human rights  but the cultural norms that existed in the area  So there became the opportunity for an alliance  an alliance between our military and local people against Al Qaeda  That is why the Levin Reed Amendment includes the continuing efforts against Al Qaeda as a remaining mission and a vital national security interest of the United States     If one looks  though  at the map that was just on the easel  that does not describe the situation in the rest of Iraq  In the south  I think it is clear that Iran is the political occupier  that Iranian agents are largely calling the shots and that there is an internecine struggle for power among a variety of Shiite militias  The lawlessness inside Basra and in the surrounding region cannot be quelled by any external force  The British have not only drawn down their troops  but they ve withdrawn to their bases  They know they can t go out and calm the waters  because the various factions are vying for power   They re going to continue to do so until someone emerges  And Iran is largely influential in determining who that might be    In Baghdad  we ve gone from neighborhood to neighborhood  And  yes  where we are  we secure the area  The violence recedes only to pop up somewhere else  either in Baghdad or maybe in Diyala or Baqoubah or somewhere else     So  Madam President  the problem is that Iraq is not Al Anbar province  Al Qaeda is not the major source of the instability in Iraq  It conducts the most violent and spectacular missions  It provides the suicidal killers who blow themselves up and blow up the cars and trucks in which they live at the moment  But they are not the primary cause of the violence and instability in Iraq     Therefore  the counterinsurgency cannot succeed unless there is a dramatic change in the attitude of both the government and the people of Iraq  I do not see that happening     The Iraqi government has not been willing to make the hard decisions  The debate as to whether they are incapable or unwilling is beside the point  They haven t done it  We keep hearing every year  every month  every week  things will be different  How many times have we heard that as the Iraqis stand up  our troops will stand down  How many times have we heard that in 6 months  8 months  12 months our troops may start coming home    Meanwhile  there are more American troops in Iraq today than ever before  The Iraqi government is more fractured and less effective       The right strategy before the surge and the right strategy now  post escalation  is the same  Start bringing our troops out of this multisided  sectarian civil war  I believe since our troops have accomplished the missions that were originally set forth  that withdrawing them from urban combat  from patrol duty  from the kind of hand to hand engagement that they are currently confronted by is the right military and political strategy     It is clear that as we look at where we are today in Iraq  we are asking our young men and women to police a civil war  There is no argument about the very basic premise that there is no military solution     And yet  the political front has been neglected  If there had been a political surge and a diplomatic surge  we might be looking at a different situation     We also know that the training and performance of the Iraqi army and police forces have not been sufficient to relieve our troops of the primary responsibility for the fight   In fact  because of setbacks and other problems  the number of Iraqi troops that are actually available to fight alongside or to take responsibility for the fight has diminished     And as our troops serve alongside Iraqi army officers and soldiers  they find that  yes  some do have loyalty to Iraq  Others  however  are loyal to sectarian militias  Others have looked the other way when the insurgents have planted bombs  And some have even taken up arms against Americans while wearing the uniforms that we helped provide     The catalog of miscalculations  misjudgments and mistakes in Iraq shocks the conscience  And the unilateral decision to rush to a preemptive war without allowing the inspectors to finish their work or waiting for diplomacy to run its course  to the failure to send enough troops or provide proper equipment for them  to the denial of a rising insurgency and the failure to adjust the military strategy  to continued support for a government unwilling to make the necessary political compromises  to the adherence to a broken policy more than four years after the invasion began     Many of us believe that it is time for us to move our troops out of harm s way in the middle of the Iraqi civil war  We believe that is an appropriate military decision that will be made sooner or later     The recent report which was an interim report did not have very much good news in it  In September  we will get another report which I predict will be also mixed  which will put the best face on whatever the facts are  but the bottom line will remain the same  Our troops and their families are paying the price for this administration s policies     Since the Bush administration announced this escalation  14 brave New Yorkers have been killed in Iraq and hundreds more wounded  Two soldiers from the Tenth Mountain Division based in Fort Drum listed as captured or missing     Since the war began  3 619 young Americans have been killed  26 000 wounded  Many with very visible wounds  loss of limbs  loss of eyes  Others with those wounds that are invisible but no less injurious  Depression  anxiety  post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury     We ve spent more than  450 billion so far   10 billion each month  We re straining our budget  The president s two major initiatives since he was sworn into office in January 2001 have been tax cuts for the rich and the war in Iraq  neither of which he s paid for  They have been put on the American credit card  They have been funded by borrowing money from foreign countries  further undermining our standing and our leverage in the world     Our involvement in Iraq continues to erode our position   It has damaged our alliances and it s limited our ability to respond to real threats   The unclassified key judgments of the recent National Intelligence Estimate  called the Terrorist Threat to the U S  Homeland  says that the threat of Al Qaeda is persistent and evolving   The report states that Al Qaeda will probably seek to leverage the contacts and capabilities of Al Qaeda in Iraq  its most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the homeland     This reality is a sobering one and I believe one that demands a new direction   I continue to press for a basic three step approach   First  start bringing our troops out of harm s way now   Second  demand and back up those demands that the Iraqis take responsibility for their country or lose the aid we are providing them     Everyone knows that the Iraqi government is as much a client of Iran as it is an ally of the United States   Our presence in this multisided sectarian civil war without a diplomatic or political strategy makes it unlikely that the Iraqi government will seek the resolution of the disputes that lie at the heart of this ongoing civil war     Thirdly  we should begin long overdue intensive regional and international diplomacy on a sustained basis   Now  diplomacy in and of itself does not promise any great solution  but we have neglected it at our peril   Others have rushed to fill the vacuum   In fact  the problems that were pointed out on the map of the region have also been impacted by the Administrations failure to pursue smart diplomacy   And as we look at the deteriorating situation in the Middle East  the pressures on the Israeli government because of the rise of Hamas and the strength of Hezbollah  we can see the consequences of both our failed diplomatic strategy and our problems in Iraq today      I have called for the strategic redeployment of U S  forces out of Iraq for several years   I ve introduced legislation to end the war  but to remain committed to vital national security interests that can be enumerated and more carefully defined   I voted against funding the war without any plan for ending it or without any companion efforts to engage in realistic  political  and diplomatic initiatives     That is why I joined a bipartisan majority in supporting the Levin Reed Amendment  It has been very difficult to get the President s attention   I hear that from both sides of the aisle   The Congress has both a duty and an opportunity to try to do that   We have one Commander in Chief at a time  and we have seen repeatedly this Administration fail to deal with the realities that we confront in Iraq and elsewhere around the world   When they do change course  as long as it takes them to make that decision as we have just seen in North Korea  the results can be very positive   And I can only hope that in the remaining 18 months of this Administration  similar actions are undertaken to deal with the problems we confront in the larger region  including Iraq and the Middle East     I believe  too  that it s imperative that the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs inform the Congress of the plans they have for redeployment and withdrawal   Withdrawing troops is dangerous and difficult   We must not redeploy out of Iraq with the same failure of planning with which our troops were deployed into Iraq   And yet  I wrote several weeks ago to Secretary Gates and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  General Pace  asking whether there is planning  very specific planning  not the usual response Oh  yes  we plan for everything  we plan for every contingency  What is the planning that will protect our troops when they do withdraw  which will happen  whether it happens in 120 days or it happens next year or it happens the year after   What have we done to make sure that we do it in as careful and orderly a way as possible     Madam Chairman  I believe our troops  as well as the American people  deserve a vote yes or no on this bill   If you believe in giving the President the continued power to pursue a failed strategy without checks or balance by this Congress  make your case and cast your vote   If not  then put partisanship aside and stand with the bipartisan majority working to end this war      Our message to the President is clear   It s time to start thinking of our troops and our broader position in Iraq and beyond  not next year  not next month  but today      I hope  Madam President  that we will be able to vote on the Levin Reed Amendment   I fear that we will not in the face of objections on the other side  but we are just postponing the inevitable   Come September  we will have another inconclusive report   We will have more casualties  we will have more who are injured  we will still have the same Iraqi government waiting us out   We will continue to empower Iran and to destabilize Jordan and to give a free hand to Syria and Hezbollah  and we will face an even more dangerous set of choices then   There is no reason to wait      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq         ,0

                      Markey  Clinton  Nuclear Regulatory Commission Abdicates Responsibility for Dirty Bomb Security

                     Washington  DC   Representative Edward Markey  MA  and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today again called on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  to tighten controls on nuclear materials that could be used to create a dirty bomb  especially in light of recent reports that Al Qaeda had published a  how to make a dirty bomb guide  online   According to the March 2  2006 edition of Global Issues Report   the militant Islamic online forum AlGhorabaa net  a site commonly used by Al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents  recently circulated Arabic language instructions on how to make a radium dirty bomb   The article reportedly includes photos and detailed directions in order to  make the experiment easy and available for you  my brother the mujahid  as they say  in the kitchen            The NRC is on another planet if it thinks the issue of tracking dirty bomb material is a public health issue  not an issue of preventing a terrorist from deploying and detonating a weapon in the war on terror   said Rep  Markey   We wouldn t ask each state to take primary responsibility for overseeing loose nuclear weapons  yet the NRC is proposing that much of the federal responsibility over loose nuclear material be imposed on state environmental and health inspectors            It is outrageous that the NRC would abdicate its responsibility to track dirty bomb components that we know terrorists would like to get their hands on  The threat of a dirty bomb is a security risk  This is just one more example of failure to ensure our homeland security   New York remains a top threat of terrorist attack and a dirty bomb attack would wreak economic havoc in addition to the risk to human life and health posed by the blast and radiation   In the post 9 11 world  it is unacceptable that the NRC would abdicate its responsibility to track nuclear materials   We need national tracking of nuclear materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb to make sure they don t fall into the wrong hands   said Senator Clinton          Markey and Clinton secured passage of an amendment to the Energy Bill that required a cradle to grave  national tracking system for materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb in order to reduce the risk that terrorists could obtain these materials   The legislation also required the NRC to regulate radium for the first time  However  the NRC has made the short sighted and ill considered decision that controlling these materials is not a security issue and should not be a federal responsibility   Instead  they have deemed this a public health and safety issue and pushed responsibility for implementing the tracking system to the States  effectively eliminating the ability of the NRC to enforce compliance            In a letter to the Chairman of the NRC on June 22  2006  Markey and Clinton called on the NRC to abide by the stricter standard set by the law and make controlling these nuclear materials the federal security priority this threat requires    See more   here   On August 1  2006  the NRC sent its response  which indicated that               States representing about 29  of all radioactive sources to be covered by the tracking system opposed  CA  FL  IL  MA  NY  and States representing about 17  of all radioactive sources to be covered by the tracking system were neutral about  AL  GA  LA  MS  NM  NC  RI  TN  UT  WI  the NRC s move to shift responsibility for implementing and enforcing the tracking system requirements to the States   The NRC will also implement the tracking system in an additional 16 States representing about 20  of all radioactive sources to be covered by the tracking system  These States do not have Agreements with the NRC that would enable them to implement the tracking system            The NRC confirmed that if the rule proceeds using the public health and safety basis  individual States would be expected to oversee and enforce their own implementation of the tracking system  It also confirmed that this would save the Commission money   while shifting these costs to the States           Under the current proposal  if a radiation source is shipped from one State to another  the recipient State would not be notified that it now had an additional source to track              10 States do not currently have 24 7 capability to access tracking source

772,October 10  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on EPA to Better Protect the Health of Our Nation s Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to take the necessary steps to better protect the health of our nations children   In a letter to the EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson  Senator Clinton urged the agency to examine the areas where it has failed to make improvements to protect childrens health  identify the opportunities to make additional gains  and ensure that achievements are not lost due to complacency and lack of commitment   Senator Clinton s letter follows release by the EPA of a report outlining its efforts to address children s environmental health  including an overview of the agency s work in the ten years since the Clinton Administration implemented a landmark executive order to protect children from environmental health and safety risks       The EPA and this administration have failed to continue the progress made during the Clinton Administration in protecting the health of our nations children  Despite efforts during the Clinton Administration to create a sustained framework for addressing childrens environmental health issues  the EPA has not followed through on this commitment  It is critical for the agency to ensure our childrens health is protected  said Senator Clinton     In 1997  the Clinton Administration released Executive Order 13045  Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks  which called for federal agencies to identify and assess environmental health risks and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children and carry out activities to address such risks  While gains have been made in the decade since this order was promulgated  the EPA  s actions have raised concerns about the commitment of the current Administration to childrens health protection    Senator Clinton has been active in working to improve childrens environmental health  As Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  she has worked to ensure that the EPA address the health impacts of those disproportionately burdened by environmental pollutants  Last month  she requested  along with Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigate the extent to which EPA incorporates and utilizes the recommendations of the Childrens Health Protection Advisory Committee   the body of experts designed to help EPA ensure that the interests of children are represented in the agencys activities   Senator Clinton has also introduced the Family Asthma Act and the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act to help decrease exposures to the environmental pollutants linked to childhood illness     The letter sent to Administrator Johnson follows    The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  United States Environmental Protection Agency  Ariel Rios Building   1101A  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20460   Dear Administrator Johnson    Last week  the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  released a report entitled  Childrens Environmental Health  2007 Highlights   This report contained an overview of the work that the EPA has done to address childrens health issues in the ten years since the release of Executive Order 13045  entitled Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks    Yet in the decade since the release of that Executive Order  I believe that we have failed to continue our progress in protecting the health of our nations children   The EPA has taken several actions that indicate a lack of concern for childrens health  including the merging of the Childrens Health Protection and Environmental Education offices and the approval of the Childrens Environmental Exposure Research Study  CHEERS   which raised concerns about industry influence over the agencys scientific activities   In an April 2007 letter to you  the Childrens Health Protection Advisory Committee  CHPAC   the experts convened by the EPA to advise the agency  expressed concern that the focus on childrens environmental health at the EPA has diminished     I am particularly concerned that some of the initiatives that you highlight in this report are not as strong as they could be in protecting childrens health   For example  you highlight the work of the EPA in raising awareness about mercury in fish   Yet despite independent testing noting that additional risks may be present in fish labeled as lower risk  your agency has not updated the 2004 EPA FDA Joint Advisory on mercury in fish and shellfish     You cite the work of the Centers for Childrens Environmental Health and Disease Prevention  yet fail to address concerns about the potential restructuring of the community based participatory research components of these programs  despite the findings of a joint report from the EPAs Board of Scientific Counselors and CHPAC that found that Centers that were most active in utilizing community members as research partners seemed better able to inform local policy makers   And while you praise the work of the Americas Children and the Environment  ACE  reports  the EPA has not released one of these reports since 2003   Indeed  the data from the ACE website notes that the percentage of children that did not meet drinking water standards for lead  coliforms  and nitrates actually increased from 2003 to 2005  with reductions of health based violations in drinking water made since 1997 virtually eradicated by 2005    The tenth anniversary of Executive Order 13045 gives us the opportunity to reevaluate the EPAs activities and redouble our commitment to childrens health protection   I would urge you to examine the areas where we have failed to make improvements  identify the opportunities to make additional gains  and ensure that our achievements are not lost due to complacency and lack of commitment   I would also ask that you provide me with a plan for concrete action in response to the April 10  2007 letter from the CHPAC   I would also appreciate learning the timeline for the review of their recommendations from the relevant EPA offices  which you committed to carrying out in your June 13 response to the CHPAC letter    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton        ,0

                     Washington  DC    As the elections in Iraq move forward  Senator Clinton has joined 40 of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the President urging him to engage in a frank dialogue with the American people about what lies ahead in Iraq and reiterating the position of a bipartisan majority of the Senate that the Iraqi people take the lead in defending and governing their country   In the letter  the Senators encouraged the President to provide the public with a plan for Iraq    we regret that the American people have still not been presented with a plan that identifies the remaining political  economic  and military benchmarks that must be met in order to facilitate the phased redeployment of U S  forces and a reasonable schedule to achieve them              Senator Clinton also today praised the women in Iraq who are bravely taking a stand to protect their rights and encouraged women to vote in the elections and continue to push for women  s rights as the Iraqi constitution is drafted            Senator Clinton  s statement on the importance of women  s rights in Iraq and the text of the letter to the President follow        Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Protecting Women  s Rights in Iraq      Every day the women in Iraq are braving great odds to secure for themselves a political future that protects their rights and those of their daughters and granddaughters   Thousands of women have offered themselves as candidates in the upcoming elections  thousands more will come forward to monitor the polls    Women s groups and women from numerous political parties have joined together to advocate for strong protections for women s rights in the constitution  and that fight will continue until the language of that constitution is finalized next year   Women are already preparing to advocate for changes in social policy  greater transparency in government  and laws to fight corruption          I hope that women will vote in large numbers in the December 15th elections  and that those who are elected will continue to push for strong protections for women in Iraq   Activists and leaders throughout the world know that their struggle will strengthen the cause of women everywhere             The text of the letter to the President          December 14  2005         The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500       Dear Mr  President        All Americans recognize the historic nature of the elections for a permanent  democratic government in Iraq on Thursday   We salute our courageous men and women in uniform  who are serving proudly in Iraq under enormously difficult circumstances  and whose dedication and sacrifice are making these elections possible             Like you  we hope the elections will proceed peacefully and the Iraqi people will succeed in electing a legitimate government that is capable of uniting the Sunni  Shiite and Kurdish people   We know that successful elections can play an important part in defeating the insurgency and hastening the day when Iraqis can govern themselves without outside assistance          We also know that the work of the Iraqi people to build the kind of Iraq we would all like to see does not end with these elections   It is vital that the Iraqis move more quickly toward inclusive political solutions   The four month period after the Iraqi elections  when the new government will attempt to finalize a Constitution  is perhaps the most critical time for the Iraqis and our troops   That is why 79 members of the Senate  including 41 Republicans  voted last month for an amendment that said    calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty  with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq  thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq      A strong bipartisan majority of the Senate believes Iraqis must now step forward in the months ahead and take the lead in defending and governing their own country          Your leadership will be essential in achieving this objective   As was stated in the bipartisan amendment that passed the Senate    the  Bush  Administration should tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq within the schedule they set for themselves      Your leadership will also be needed to ensure that we leverage the influence of the international community and Iraq  s neighbors to push for a sustainable political compromise  and that we stand up sufficient numbers of capable Iraqi security forces so that our troops can begin standing down          Finally  we also believe that you must engage in a frank and honest dialogue with the American people and our troops about the road ahead in Iraq   As the bipartisan amendment stated    the  Bush  Administration needs to explain to Congress and the American people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq      While we appreciate your recent speeches on this issue  we regret that the American people have still not been presented with a plan that identifies the remaining political  economic  and military benchmarks that must be met and a reasonable schedule to achieve them   We hope you will use Wednesday  s speech to finally provide a detailed explanation of your strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq          The window of time to get things right in Iraq may be rapidly closing   The successful completion of our mission is possible only through the hard work of the Iraqi people and the effective leadership of your Administration   We stand ready to work with the Iraqi people and your Administration in the days ahead             Sincerely

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON  D C     In a letter to Education Secretary Margaret Spellings  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton assailed the Administration  s decision to slash funds to ten colleges in New York and urged that the money be restored   Nine members of the New York delegation joined the Senator in denouncing the decision to eliminate all funds coming to ten New York colleges through the TRIO Student Support Services  SSS  Program which helps low income and first generation students and students with disabilities        As a result of the Administration  s action  New York stands to lose over  3 million in funding  cutting off services for more than 2 000 students and ending nearly 20 percent of all SSS programs in New York State  including those at Rockland Community College  Fordham University  Iona College  Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology and six City University of New York  CUNY  campuses including Bronx Community College  Hunter College  John Jay College of Criminal Justice  Medgar Evers College  Queensborough Community College and Queens College          At a time when we are encouraging students to stay in school and do their best  it is outrageous that the Administration has cut funds to those who need our help the most     Senator Clinton said    It is not a great deal of money  but it can make a great deal of difference to many students  I am pleased that my colleagues have joined in this effort and I call on the Secretary of Education to reverse this decision immediately           In reaction to the Department  s decision  Senator Clinton urged a number of her congressional colleagues to sign a letter to the Secretary of Education  Margaret Spellings  expressing grave concern about the impact of the discontinuation of funding  In their letter  Senator Clinton and her colleagues expressed their concerns that New York was disproportionately targeted for these cuts and urged Secretary Spellings to reconsider the Department  s decision        Without SSS funding  Fordham University will be forced to end a program that has provided academic preparation services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds for more than twenty years   At Iona College  200 students will lose professional counseling  peer mentoring  grant aid  workshops in areas such as study skills and test taking  and tutoring from professionals in writing and in

send a letter to the Appropriations Committee asking to retain GEAR UP  another critical early intervention program that helps disadvantaged children go to college  created under the Clinton Administration  President Bush proposed eliminating this program in his FY2006 budget          A copy of the congressional letter on the TRIO program cuts is attached          June 9  2005         The Honorable Margaret Spellings  Secretary of Education  United States Department of Education  400 Maryland Avenue  NW  Washington  D C   20202       Dear Madam Secretary        We are writing to share our concerns about the impact of the Department of Education  s recent decision to discontinue funding for 10 New York State TRIO Student Support Services  SSS  programs   This cut represents nearly 20 percent of all programs targeted for elimination across the nation and the highest percentage of TRIO SSS program losses experienced by any state   We are particularly concerned that it appears New York was disproportionately targeted for these cuts and are deeply troubled about the negative effect this decision will have on students and families in our communities   We urge you to provide an external review of these applications to ensure that they received a fair and impartial evaluation and ask that you carefully consider the appeals of individual campuses         We recognize that  by its nature  a peer review process involves subjective judgment and that some peer review panels impose stricter standards than others   It is our understanding that  for this reason  the Department  s usual practice is to distribute applications from each state or region across panels   However  in the case of Student Support Services applications from New York State  it appears that this was not done consistent with usual practice   We understand that at least five applications from New York were concentrated in one panel and that all five of those applications were targeted for elimination   We are concerned that this result may have stemmed from a failure to provide for a fair and unbiased reading of applications from New York         The TRIO SSS programs support the retention and graduation of low income students  first generation students  and students with disabilities   A comparison of the currently funded SSS projects in New York and the list of projects approved for funding as a result of the 2005 TRIO SSS grant competition reveals that 10 campuses in New York State are slated to lose funding   As a result  New York will lose over  3 million in funding  cutting off services for more than 2 000 students   These program eliminations come at a time of significant need for SSS funding in New York State and despite more than 25 years of experience that many of our state  s institutions possess with the SSS program        As a result of the Department  s decisions  nearly 20 percent of all SSS programs in New York State will end  including the programs at Rockland Community College  Fordham University  Iona College  Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology  and six City University of New York  CUNY  campuses          If Rockland Community College  s  RCC  SSS grant is not renewed  the Student Support Services Program Tutoring Lab will close  eliminating a vital tutorial service to almost 200 academically underprepared students  Without SSS funding  Fordham University will be forced to end a program that has provided academic preparation services to students from disadvantaged backgrounds for more than twenty years   At Iona College  200 students will lose professional counseling  peer mentoring  grant aid  workshops in areas such as study skills and test taking  and tutoring from professionals in writing and in mathematics   If SSS funding is not renewed at Vaughn College  225 low income  first generation  and minority students would lose access to summer English and math remediation courses and the essential financial  academic and personal support services that allow students to successfully pursue a degree and graduate        Further  the Department  s failure to renew the six City University of New York  CUNY  SSS programs will harm more than 1 600 students  and result in a loss of more than  2 million to the University   As the nation  s largest urban public university system  CUNY provides higher education opportunities to a large number of first generation and low income students   In addition  CUNY provides critical support services to more than 9 000 students with disabilities  One quarter of all New York State college students with disabilities are enrolled at CUNY  and most of those students are eligible to participate in SSS programs         These TRIO program reductions come at a time when large gaps in college enrollment and completion exist for low income and minority students   Of high school graduates  those from high income families enter college at rates 25 percentage points higher than those from low income families   By their late 20s  more than one third of Caucasians have at least a bachelor  s degree  but only 18 percent of African Americans and 10 percent of Hispanics have attained degrees   TRIO SSS programs serve as a vital link to higher education for these students by providing a range of services from pre college summer programs  to tutoring and developmental instruction  to counseling and advising programs  and peer support         Research indicates that TRIO SSS programs across the nation are working to increase college retention and graduation rates   A national study of the program commissioned by the Department of Education found that Student Support Services increases retention to the third year by nearly one third   Currently  Student Support Services programs at over 930 colleges and universities assist nearly 200 000 low income and disabled youth each year        We are confident of your commitment to ensure a fair and impartial review of all applications submitted to the Department for funding  as well as your commitment to ensure public confidence in the process   We hope you agree that the apparent irregularities uncovered in the reading of applications from New York are unacceptable  and we urge you to provide an external review of these 10 New York TRIO SSS applications   Our staff will arrange to meet with you to discuss information about the review process and the steps you will take to address our concerns          We are hopeful that we can work together to save TRIO programs across New York State and thank you for your attention to this important matter        Sincerely        Senator Clinton  D NY   Senator Schumer  D NY   Congressman Serrano  D NY 16   Congresswoman Maloney  D NY 14

1977,"NATIONAL FARMERS MARKET WEEK
  Senator Bernie Sanders checked out the fresh fruits and vegetables grown in Vermont during a stop this week at a Middlebury farmers market to help promote National Farmers Market Week. For common-sense economic and environmental reasons, Vermont is a leader in a growing movement favoring locally produced food. 
   Buying local and seasonal food for ourselves and our families will reinvest money in our communities and in local farms.
   Vermont has 59 farms that sell directly to consumers, according to the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. For its size, our state has an incredibly strong local food movement that is growing every day.
   Not only do consumers offer farmers good prices for their produce, but it's cheaper for the shopper too. Buying food from a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm or at a farmers' market reduces transportation costs. It also benefits the environment because local food is often grown with fewer pesticides and its production does not include carbon-intensive transportation over long distances.
   And, oh yeah, fresh food tastes better.
   Although direct food sales from farms to consumers make up only 1.2 percent of total food expenditures by Vermonters, that statistic leads the nation. Vermont's per capita direct sales to consumers is more than five times the national average, according to an analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture figures by University of Vermont graduate student Dave Timmons.
   There is room to grow. If Vermonters substituted local products for just 10 percent of the food that is currently imported to Vermont, 3,616 Vermont jobs would be created, Burlington economist Doug Hoffer has calculated.
   August 5 through 11 was declared Farmers Market Week by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns.

Western New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Western New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Western New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             Western New York has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support             8 million in federal funds will go to DRS    Electronic Warfare and Network Systems for the UMTE Modernization project  Money for the UMTE program will be used to upgrade four existing systems located at one of the key ranges at the Nellis Test and Training Range in Nevada  The continuing proliferation of surface to air missiles and other anti aircraft presents a significant threat to our military forces  This upgrade of the UMTE systems takes advantage of mature and electronic warfare threat simulation technology and will result in more realistic training  and increased aircrew survivability  while providing substantial savings  DRS

892,July 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Following Her Meeting with Secretary Chertoff Today on Homeland Security Funding for New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I am disappointed to think that we are never going to agree with Secretary Chertoff about how to allocate our nations limited Homeland Security funds   We believe that New York has never gotten its fair share  that there has been an underestimation of the risk we have to confront and we certainly made that very clear to the Secretary today      I am profoundly disappointed that the Secretary continues to ignore the homeland security needs of New York  I remain shocked at the Department of Homeland Securitys disregard for the threats the New York City region faces and am very discouraged that the Department still has not learned from its past mistakes on this critical issue     It is insulting to the New York City Region  and to all Americans  that at the very same time he is warning us about the growth of al Qaeda and a possible terrorist attack on American soil this summer  the Secretary is also disregarding the funding needs of high threat areas like New York City    We were not satisfied with the explanations that the Secretary put forth today and we are going to continue to fight for every dollar we can get because we believe that New York remains the number one terrorist target in the nation and we are going to do everything we can to protect it    I will continue to press this issue until the Secretary and the Administration finally recognize that our limited Homeland Security funds must go to the regions facing the greatest risk  I will not stop fighting for the funding that New York needs and deserves    In anticipation of her meeting with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton earlier this week called on the Secretary to explain the Departments reasoning behind the continual short changing of the New York metropolitan area when it comes to national homeland security funding   See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 278517      Recent reports indicate that the New York metropolitan area  which includes New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties  will receive  134 million from the Department of Homeland Security under its Urban Area Security Initiative grant program for 2007  which represents a 7 7  increase over the  124 million awarded in 2006  but is still nowhere near the  207 million received in 2005  Senator Clinton emphasized that New York continues to be a top terrorist target and this repeated under funding threatens New York s ability to maintain its necessary high level of vigilance   An announcement on the final amount is expected from the Department of Homeland Security shortly         ,0

          CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 In 2000  Congress passed a provision requiring the SBA to award 5  of contracts to women owned businesses WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to the head of the Small Business Administration  SBA   Steven Preston  objecting to the SBA s proposed rule  entitled Women Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance procedures  which would do little or nothing to rectify the underrepresentation of and discrimination against women owned businesses in government contracting awards    For decades  evidence has shown that women and minority business owners have been subject to discrimination through lending  access to capital  and basic access to federal contracting opportunities   In 2000  Congress passed legislation to move towards rectifying this problem by aiming to award 5  of federal contracts to women owned businesses   However  this goal has never been met as a result of the SBA s refusal for seven years to take the necessary steps to implement the legislation  and it is unlikely to be met with these unnecessarily stringent proposed regulations  In the letter  Obama calls on the SBA to withdraw its proposal and replace it with a program that reflects the appropriate legal standard  Congressional intent  and the pervasive lack of federal contracting opportunities for women owned small businesses   The text of the letter is below  Dear Administrator Preston   As a member of the United States Senate  I write to convey my strong objection to the SBA s Proposed Rule entitled Women Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance procedures  published December 27  2007  Fed  Reg  73285    I join Senate Small Business Committee Chairman John Kerry who expressed his concerns to you in a recent letter as well  The proposal conflicts with the intent of Congress  is unjustified by any legal standard  and will do little or nothing to rectify the underrepresentation of  and discrimination and artificial barriers faced by  women owned businesses in government contracting awards  As decades of evidence has shown  women business owners and minority business owners have been subject to discrimination in numerous ways  including in lending  access to capital  and basic access to federal contracting opportunities   Based on the record  in 2000  Congress passed an unambiguous law that sought to take a small step toward rectifying this chronic problem faced by women owned businesses   The legislation set a realistic and modest goal that 5  of federal contracts be awarded to women owned businesses   Because of persistent barriers  this goal has never been met   In 2006  women owned businesses comprised 30 percent of all small businesses but received only 3 4  of all federal contracts    There is thus a critical need to implement the Women s Procurement Program in ways that will ensure that Congress s purposes will fully be met   The SBA proposal is not only inadequate to meet this goal  in fact it affirmatively undermines Congress s intent that women owned businesses be awarded their fair share of government contracts    First  the SBA proposed regulations impose legal requirements that go far beyond any legal standard  statutory or constitutional   These requirements create a hurdle for federal agencies which will ensure that Congress s permissible and critical goals will never be met    Moreover  the SBA has unnecessarily and unfairly restricted application of the Women s Procurement Program   Congress exceeded constitutional requirements in directing that the Program be used only in the specific industries where women owned businesses are under represented   But in interpreting the study it commissioned  the SBA limited the Program to only 4 of 2 300 business categories  in fact  the study should fairly be read to find under representation in the overwhelming majority of business categories    Despite a clear and legally justified Congressional mandate  the SBA refused to release the necessary implementing regulations for seven years   Unfortunately  this long awaited proposal is a tragic step backward   The SBA should withdraw this proposal and replace it with a program that reflects the appropriate legal standard  Congressional intent  and the pervasive lack of federal contracting opportunities for women owned small businesses     Sincerely    Barack Obama United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other

1612,May 19  2006 New York Congressional Delegation Calls On Secretary Johanns To Protect The Livelihood Of NY Grape Growers

                 Members of Congress Call for Emergency Disaster Assistance to Aid Grape Growers Following Devastating Spring Freeze Washington  DC    A bi partisan coalition of New York  s Congressional Delegation is calling on U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Mike Johanns to provide disaster assistance to grape producers affected by the spring freeze   In a letter initiated by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Brian Higgins  29 members of the New York Congressional delegation called on the USDA Secretary to immediately authorize disaster assistance to ensure that grape producers can recover and continue to contribute to the overall economic health of the state  s agriculture industry            Mother nature has not been kind to New York  s grape growers but the recent adverse weather has come at an especially bad time  We must step in and help our growers  which is why we are urging Secretary Johanns to review and grant this request as quickly as possible     Senator Clinton said    New York farmers know better than anyone that if their crops can t grow  neither can our economy  This federal assistance is crucial to keeping our farmers on their feet financially and preserving the economic lifeblood of countless New York communities  Weather disasters cannot be prevented but financial devastation can                Western New York grape growers desperately need help from our federal government to right the economic crisis they are finding themselves in     said Rep  Higgins     Our grape crops are the lifeblood of hundreds of producers in our region  and the loss will be vast and hard hitting               On April 25th and 26th  freezing weather caused major damage to grape crops in New York State at a time during their growth when buds were extremely susceptible to damage   It is estimated that over 200 grape producers on over 6 400 acres in four Western New York counties    Chautauqua  Cattaraugus  Erie  and Niagara    will suffer combined losses exceeding  9 1 million dollars            Western New York is home to the largest continuous acreage of Concord grapes in the world and generates over  41 million annually for its producers   It also contains the headquarters of the largest Concord and Niagara based grape cooperative  National Grape  Welch  s  the largest private label juice company in the U S   also has a large presence in Western New York   In 2004  the state wide grape and wine industries provided 23 000 full time equivalent jobs and contributed over  3 3 billion in economic value to the state  s economy  according to a recent study by Napa Valley based MKF Research LLC          Unfortunately  the freeze came at a very bad time for the grape industry  as most producers have faced a two year period of over supply and very low prices resulting in either low or non existent profit margins   Crop loss is likely to force some vineyard operations out of business  while others struggle to cope   In addition  the loss will have broader negative economic ramifications for support industries  including lending institutions  farm equipment suppliers  and fertilizer and nutrition suppliers  which depend upon the business of the affected producers          Emergency disaster assistance would open up a much needed opportunity for grape producers to recover from the recent combination of economic and weather related hardships and would contribute to the overall economic health of the entire state         Click here for the estimated crop value losses for each affected county      A copy of the letter is attached          May 19  2006      The Honorable Mike Johanns  US Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Ave  SW  Washington  DC  20250      Dear Secretary Johanns       We are writing to urge you to assess the damage to grape growers affected by recent severe freeze in New York State and to urge you to provide USDA disaster assistance as appropriate   Preserving the viability of our grape farmers is critical to our state  s economy            The unseasonable freeze on April 25th and 26th  2006 occurred at a time when primary buds were at the one inch growth stage and were extremely susceptible to damage   As a result  there will likely be catastrophic crop losses this year   Over 200 grape producers on over 6 400 acres in four Western New York counties    Chautauqua  Cattaraugus  Erie  and Niagara    are estimated to suffer losses exceeding  9 1 million dollars            In 2004  the New York State grape and wine industries provided 23 000 full time equivalent jobs and contributed over  3 3 billion in economic value to the state  s economy  according to a recent study by Napa Valley based MKF Research LLC   On an annual basis  this figure should be viewed as conservative  as the 2004 grape crop and corresponding wine and grape juice production  were significantly reduced due by an unusually severe winter freeze   As the fastest growing agricultural industry in New York State and as a major driver of agro tourism  the grape and wine industries comprise two major economic sectors of the state          This crop loss comes at a very bad time specifically for the labrusca grape juice industry  since the industry has been faced with a two year period of over supply and very low prices  resulting in either low or non existent profit margins for most grape producers   This spring  s freeze damage is likely to force some affected vineyard operations out of business  while others will increase borrowed capital  which is already limited   In addition  the loss will have broader negative ramifications on support industries and surrounding rural communities which are dependent upon economic contributions from the grape industry          We ask that you please work expeditiously with the county and state Farm Service Agencies  FSA  to conduct a survey of damage in the areas impacted by the freeze  additionally  in order to deal with the damage  assistance must be expedited to ensure adequate recovery and farm viability through the rest of the season          We urge you to give this

1827,"HOW ARE YOU DOING?
  Almost every day the Bush administration proclaims how ""robust"" the economy is. Not surprisingly, most Americans don't agree with the president. Poll after poll shows that the vast majority of Americans believe our country is moving in the wrong direction and many more believe that the economy is getting worse, rather than better. In fact, according to a recent CBS poll, by an almost two-to-one margin, Americans indicated their belief that life for middle-class Americans has gotten worse over the last decade. 
   Let's take a brief look at what's been going on in Vermont and the nation since President Bush was sworn into office, and then consider how we can move our country in a very different direction.  
   While unemployment in Vermont and most of the country today remains fairly low, we are suffering a major crisis in wage deflation. Even though technology is exploding and worker productivity is increasing, nationally, median household income declined by $1,273 between 2000 and 2006. In Vermont, median household income in 2005 was $44,883, 13 percent less than it was in 2000. In other words, while there are jobs available it is harder and harder to find one that provides a strong income. , Even college graduates saw a 5 percent decline in their earnings between 2000 and 2004, after adjusting for inflation.
   Since Bush has been in office the United States has lost over 3 million good paying manufacturing jobs. Sadly, in Vermont, our manufacturing base is in steep decline with almost 25 percent of our manufacturing jobs disappearing between 2001 and 2007. 
   But that's only part of the story. In America today it's not just that the middle class is shrinking. We are also seeing a significant increase in poverty. Since Bush has been president, 5.4 million Americans have slipped into poverty and more and more people are homeless and hungry. In Vermont, the poverty rate t has risen from 9.4 percent in 2002 to 11.5 percent in 2005.
   At the same time as wages and income are declining for many Americans, the cost of basic necessities is increasing. Since Bush has been in office the price of a gallon of gas has more than doubled. In rural states like Vermont, where people drive long distances to work, this has caused serious financial problems for many thousands of Vermont workers.
   Further, health care costs continue to soar. In Vermont, premiums increased 58.8 percent, or $1,774, between 2001 and 2006. And anyone who has kids in college can attest to the rapid increase in college costs.
   Given the continued decline of the middle class and the increase in poverty, what should Congress be doing? 
   First, we must reverse the disastrous trade policies that have resulted in record breaking trade deficits and the loss of good paying jobs. I will do all that I can to oppose trade agreements which make it easier for employers to outsource American jobs, and force wages down. Corporate America must start investing in the United States and create good paying jobs here, and not just in China and other low-wage countries.
   Congress recently raised the minimum wage, which is a good step forward in alleviating poverty. But, if we are serious about ""family values"" we must do much more - especially for our children. We must make sure that Head Start and childcare are adequately funded, and that all families have the opportunity for a college education. We must also make certain that no one in America goes hungry. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee I am working hard on all these issues. 
   While we spend twice as much per person on health care as any other country, nearly 47 million Americans have no health insurance. My office has been working successfully with communities around Vermont to expand Federally Qualified Health Centers which provide affordable health and dental care, low-cost prescription drugs and mental health counseling on a sliding scale. But, clearly, more needs to be done. It remains a national disgrace that the United States is the only country in the industrialized world which does not guarantee health care to all of its people. I will soon be introducing legislation which will provide federal assistance to those states that wish to go forward with universal health care, including a single payer system.
   Finally, from both a moral and a financial perspective, we must address the growing income and wealth inequality which permeates our society and which is greater today than it has been in more than 75 years. There is something profoundly wrong when the richest 1 percent now earn 22 percent of the nation's income, and when the wealthiest 1 percent own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. In order to fund many of the programs desperately needed by the middle class and working families of our country, we must rescind the Bush tax breaks given to the wealthiest 1 percent.

500,   Obama Calls on Bush Administration to Examine DHL UPS Agreement for Services   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Obama Calls on Bush Administration to Examine DHL UPS Agreement for Services Tuesday  July 29  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 More than 8 000 jobs could be eliminated due to the agreement WASHINGTON  D C        U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Karl Zinsmeister  Director of the White House s Domestic Policy Council  asking the Administration to carefully examine the consolidation of DHL air operations under UPS   If the consolidation of these competitors  air services is successful  at least 8 000 jobs will likely be eliminated throughout the state of Ohio   In the letter  Obama calls on the White House to urge the Department of Justice to examine the agreement to ensure it is not in violation of antitrust laws and  ask the Department of Labor to detail its efforts to assist these unemployed workers and whether the Department s response could serve as model for other communities experiencing concentrated job loss  The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  Zinsmeister  During my recent travels  I visited with the mayor of Wilmington  Ohio and workers who would be affected by a proposed DHL UPS agreement for services that would lead to the closing of the DHL facility in Wilmington    I write to you in my capacity as a U S  Senator because I believe that the Administration must act now on two fronts  first  the Department of Justice should examine the transaction to ensure that it is not in violation of antitrust laws and second  if it is not  then the government must work to ensure that these workers and this community are not left without assistance in finding new work for its people and new use for the existing infrastructure   I am pleased that you and Assistant Secretary of Commerce Sandy Baruah have been tasked with coordinating the government response to the situation and wish to offer any assistance I or my staff can provide  As a matter of antitrust law  the proposed consolidation of DHL s domestic airlift operations under a competitor  UPS  raises concern   At the very least  the DOJ should examine whether having two competitors in a fairly concentrated market act as partners would have anti competitive effects  If the deal proceeds  Governor Strickland and Senator Brown have both told me that the DHL facility in Wilmington would likely cease operating   That would eliminate at least 8 000 jobs in Ohio and impact an estimated 41 counties   That level of concentrated job loss strongly weighs in favor of the government assisting them through the difficult time that will follow   I understand that you are working with the Department of Labor and the Department of Commerce to coordinate a rapid response to what could be a crisis for the communities involved   As a Senator on the committee of jurisdiction over the Department of Labor  I would appreciate additional detail on your efforts and how responding to this situation could serve as a model for other communities where concentrated job loss is occurring due to plants moving overseas or increasingly consolidating markets   Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator  Cc  Sandy Baruah  Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development                               Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1
1506,October 18  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Department of State  s Passport Card Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Click here to listen to audio of Senator Clinton s statement         As I have long maintained  national security and the security of our borders are of paramount importance   But the announcement by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  that they are submitting for public comment a federal rule for the development of a costly card format passport for international travel by U S  citizens through land and sea ports of entry between the United States and Canada ignores the real and practical concerns of New York  s border communities   The agencies are proposing this passport alternative to meet the requirements of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  but the People Access Security Service  PASS  card proposal  which would require families to purchase cards at a cost of  35 per child and  45 per adult  is likely to have a gravely negative impact on families  tourism  and the regional economy          There is little doubt that the cost of the contemplated PASS card would adversely affect the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the U S  Canada border  The exchange of goods between the United States and Canada is the largest trading relationship in the world   Studies indicate that this vital flow of commerce would decrease dramatically if the contemplated PASS card    or in the alternative  the even more expensive passport    were required to travel between the two countries            Furthermore  the people who live in our shared border areas regard themselves as one community of neighbors   American children play sports in Canadian youth leagues   Canadian families visit relatives who live in the U S  Americans and Canadians frequent each others homes and businesses   Imposing this costly and onerous requirement will adversely affect these communities          I remain committed to a passport alternative that properly balances our mutual interest in a secure northern border with our desire to maintain communities that are both economically and socially vibrant   Unfortunately  the PASS card proposal made by the Department of State and DHS does not yet appear to strike this proper balance             ,0

                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today urged the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation to conduct a nationwide assessment of the potential threat posed to cities  states  and key infrastructure from the theft or misuse of general aviation aircraft by criminals or terrorists  The Senator  s renewed call comes after the latest report that a man was arrested on charges of stealing a Cessna Citation 7 plane and taking it on a 350 mile joy ride from Florida to Georgia  Earlier this year  an intoxicated individual stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from an airport in Danbury  CT  eventually landing at the Westchester County Airport  located just to the east of the Indian Point nuclear facility          Following the Danbury incident  the House and Senate Conferees negotiated a final FY 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill which included a requirement  authored by Senator Clinton  for a report to be done by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Transportation assessing the dangers posed to high risk  large populations and critical infrastructure areas  should general aviation aircraft be stolen and used as a weapon  The study would also require an assessment of the vulnerabilities of general aviation airports and aircraft  Senators Durbin  D IL   Lautenberg  NJ   Corzine  NJ   Schumer  NY   and Lieberman  CT  co sponsored the original Amendment             Thankfully  the recent thefts of planes in Florida and Connecticut ended without any damage  destruction or death and were not acts of terrorism   But  they are a significant forewarning of the types of threats to which our communities remain vulnerable     Senator Clinton said    Our nuclear plants  key infrastructure  military bases  not to mention our large cities  could be threatened should a coordinated attack occur and all of the advances we have made in the area of homeland security could be subverted if general aviation airports can be breached this easily and airplanes used as weapons                I believe that this kind of national assessment is absolutely necessary to avoid a repeat of the type of attack carried out on September 11  2001 or some sinister copycat of it     Senator Clinton said    The 9 11 Commission warned us of this vulnerability and we must not turn away from the challenge of assessing threats posed by thefts or hijackings of general aviation aircraft              It is estimated that there are more than 19 000 landing facilities nationwide  including heliports  lakes  and dirt landing strips from which aircraft could be launched and more than 200 000 general aviation aircraft in the United States           In its report  the 9 11 Commission concluded that     M ajor vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security   These  together with inadequate screening and access controls  continue to present aviation security challenges     The report also said that part of the failure of the U S  government  s ability to thwart the September 11th terrorist attacks using airplanes was  in part  due to a lack of imagination about new and emerging threats in the bureaucracy           In May 2004 the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  issued their   Security Guidelines for General Aviation Airports     in which they outlined some guidelines general aviation airports should follow in order to secure aircraft and airfields  However  the same report also stated that    A s vulnerabilities within other areas of aviation have been reduced  General Aviation may be perceived as a more attractive target and consequently more vulnerable to misuse by terrorists              Specifically  the report created by Senator Clinton would require the Secretary of Homeland Security  in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation  to report on the vulnerability posed to high risk areas and facilities from general aviation aircraft that could be stolen or used as a weapon against those areas within 120 days upon enactment of the bill into law  Such areas to be considered include those with critical transportation infrastructure  nuclear facilities  military bases  and other highly populated areas with similarly situated critical infrastructure  The report will include an analysis of what security vulnerabilities exist at general aviation airports that would permit a general aviation aircraft to be stolen and used as a weapon  whether existing security precautions to prevent breaches of flight lines  perimeters  and aircraft are sufficient  and any additional security measures that could increase the security of general aviation aircraft and airports             I respect and admire the work being done by the general aviation fixed base operators  pilots  owners  airport managers  and others who have worked hard to increase security measures at general aviation airports     Senator Clinton said    General aviation is a significant contributor to the national economy and I believe our aviators should enjoy the freedom of flight throughout the country while at the same time our Department of Homeland Security can ensure safety on the ground             ,0

1189,June 15  2006 Senator Clinton Introduces Legislation to Help Service Members Returning From Iraq and Afghanistan and their Families

                  Bill would help deal with challenges like posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced the Heroes at Home Act of 2006  legislation aimed at enhancing support and services for U S  troops transitioning back home after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan  Senator Clinton  s bill proposes four key initiatives to assist military service members of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  with readjustment to work  the problems of posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and other mental health issues  and traumatic brain injury  TBI   The bill  which is supported by the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  also provides support to their family members              Hundreds of thousands of troops have rotated through Iraq and Afghanistan  including thousands of courageous men and women from New York  More military service members than ever are surviving these conflicts  but surviving these wars and transitioning home can be an uphill battle     Senator Clinton said    Many service members face readjustment challenges after war  such as medical  mental health  relationship  and work problems  Family members also are affected by the transition as they struggle to reconnect with their war heroes  some who may be deployed two  three  if not more times             The Heroes at Home Act  which Senator Clinton plans to offer as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization bill currently on the Senate floor  centers around Department of Defense  DOD  and Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  partnerships with employers and community organizations in acknowledgement of the fact that despite more services and resources being offered at DOD facilities  VA hospitals  and Vet Centers  returning service members are often reluctant to go to traditional mental health clinics due to stigma and concerns about confidentiality and their military careers  Only 29  of the approximately 500 000 separated OIF and OEF veterans have sought VA health care services  including mental health services  Last month  a GAO report found that only 22  of OIF and OEF service members who may have been at risk for developing PTSD based on post deployment screenings were referred on for further mental health evaluations  In another report from May 2005  the GAO identified that  despite DOD efforts  the needs of demobilizing Reserve and National Guard members for transition assistance were still unmet           Specifically  the Senator  s legislation would require the Secretary of Defense to build upon an existing Mental Health Task Force by partnering representatives from the public and private sectors to identify the readjustment and mental health needs of returning National Guard and Reserve members in their transition to the civilian workforce after deployment  The bill would also establish an Assistance Center for employers  employee assistance programs  and other organizations to provide them with best practices and education for ensuring the success of Guard and Reserve members in resuming civilian work           Under the legislation  demonstration grants would be awarded to organizations in community setting for providing PTSD and other mental health education and assistance to National Guard and Reserve members and their families  since many of these troops return to local communities scattered across the country far away from military bases and VA hospitals          The legislation also calls for a study on the long term physical and mental health consequences and rehabilitation needs of traumatic brain injured service members  To further assist the mushrooming number of traumatic brain injured service members and their families  this legislation would establish a TBI Family Caregiver Training Curricula for health professionals at DOD and VA hospitals  who would use the curricula to teach family members important skills for caring for their loved ones suffering from TBI when they go home            With more and more troops injured by improvised explosive devices and bombs in Iraq  we must do more to understand the effects of these blasts on those impacted by them  Lessons from past wars have taught us that identifying and dealing with problems like PTSD and TBI right away is vital for overcoming them     Senator Clinton said    We must do more today to reach out and help our newest generation of war heroes and their families as they transition home after serving bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan  Those who have proudly served our nation have made extraordinary sacrifices  These heroes deserve our best resources and support to ensure that returning home means returning to life             According to a March 2006 study  19  of Iraq veterans and 11  of Afghanistan veterans reported mental health problems  Among the OIF and OEF veterans seeking care at VA hospitals  nearly a third have been diagnosed with mental disorders  with over 40  of those PTSD  Another report found that 10  to 30  of National Guard members come home from Iraq searching for work  Others return to civilian jobs dissatisfied with old tasks that pale in comparison to wartime responsibilities  In addition to these challenges  a large number of service members are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan with life threatening brain injuries from roadside blasts that can cause brain damage  It is estimated that TBI affects more than 25  of bomb blast survivors    a percentage thought to be higher than in any other past US conflict  making TBI the   signature    injury of Iraq  The diffuse but debilitating symptoms of TBI can leave service members with cognitive and emotional problems  including the inability to adapt to civilian life  However  TBI frequently goes undiagnosed because returning troops may not realize they suffered a concussion or may not show visible signs of injury           Senator Clinton is committed to helping our troops when they return from active duty  She is an original co sponsor of the Healing Invisible Wounds Act that protects PTSD compensation  enhances counseling and readjustment services available to National Guard and Reserve members returning from combat  and authorizes additional funding for Vet Centers  Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined with the NASD Foundation  members of the armed services and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to launch a new campaign to deliver financial education tools and training to members of the military and their spouses   She also authored legislation with Senator Susan Collins  R ME  that requires the Department of Defense to provide consumer education for members of the armed forces and their spouses   Just yesterday  the Senate Banking Committee also unanimously approved legislation she introduced with Senator Mike Enzi  R WY  that would protect military personnel against individuals using deceitful practices to sell financial products           To read more about support for the Senator  s legislation  go to

1760,"SEN. SANDERS ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR NEW FIREFIGHTER TRAINING FACILITY
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced today that $406,000 was secured for a live-burn training facility for firefighters at Vermont Technical College. 
   ""Firefighting is not an easy job and all of us want to see firefighters get the best possible training they can,"" Sanders said. ""Today, I am pleased to announce a significant addition to our efforts to improve training for the Vermont fire fighting community. At my request, a $406,000 grant for a new test burn training facility was included in an appropriations bill passed by Congress just before the holidays. While this appropriation will not cover all the expenses for the building, it will go a very long way to seeing its completion.""
   Vermont Tech President Ty Handy joined the senator at the campus press conference. ""We're very excited about the opportunities and synergies this will create between Vermont Technical College's new associate's degree program in Fire Science and the excellent training programs offered by the Vermont Fire Academy,"" Handy said. ""To be able to offer this kind of training in the geographical center of Vermont will be a real plus for everyone involved in the Vermont fire fighting community.""
   Sanders also said the facility ""will be a great resource for firefighters throughout the state,"" but he added ""much more needs to be done to keep our fire fighting capabilities in Vermont strong and viable.
   ""In those cities and towns that have professional fire departments, we need to make sure that these communities have the kind of budgets they need to support their departments. In those towns that support the 94 percent of Vermont firefighters who are volunteers, we need to help them address the very serious problems of retention and recruitment. The simple truth is that in today's world, volunteer departments all over Vermont and America are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the kind of volunteer membership they need.
   ""My office is now working with the state's fire fighting community to develop federal legislation that would help local departments across the country recruit and retain the fire fighting personnel they need.""
   Sanders also used the occasion to thank Vermont firefighting community - which includes 300 professional fire fighters and 5,600 volunteers - for all that they do for the people of our state. ""These brave men and women put their lives on the line every day. They save life and property. They protect us 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. We're grateful for all that they do.""

1787,"HEALTH CARE, CHILDREN, VETERANS ARE BIG WINNERS IN BUDGET SEN. SANDERS HELPED CRAFT
  Congress adopted a $2.9 trillion budget resolution for next year that includes provisions Sen. Sanders secured to boost budgets for health care, veterans and children. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders added $575 million more than President Bush had budgeted to expand community health centers in Vermont and across the country. 
   ""Community health centers are incredibly effective in Vermont and across America in providing high-quality health care, low-cost prescription drugs, dental care, and mental health counseling in a very cost-effective way,"" Sanders said.
   He secureD the additional budget authority for the network of federally funded community health centers that, during the Bush administration, has struggled with growing demand but shrinking resources. If Congress appropriates all of the funds that have been budgeted, then new health centers would be created to serve an additional 4 million Americans. In Vermont, there are five health center networks that provide services in seven counties at 18 sites. Altogether, they serve about 10 percent of the state population. In the long term, Sanders hopes to establish health centers in every county in Vermont.
   The budget resolution, passed by the House and Senate on Thursday, includes other important provisions Sanders fought for in the budget committee.
   One creates a $5 billion reserve fund for childcare assistance under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program.
   Another $43.1 billion in discretionary spending is budgeted for veterans - $3.6 billion more than Bush requested - including the largest increase for veteran's medical care in U.S. history. The veterans increase was a top Sanders priority. He also helped create a reserve fund to boost medical care and disability benefits for wounded military personnel and veterans, expand eligibility for combat-related special compensation, expedite the disability claims process, and enhance educational benefits.
   Sanders also recently introduced the Comprehensive Veterans Benefits Improvement Act. Crafted with input from veterans and national veterans service organizations, the legislation would improve insurance, housing, pensions, health care and other benefits. ""For way too many years, many in Washington have turned their backs on veterans and their families,"" Marvin Minkler of St. Johnsbury wrote in Friday's Times Argus. ""Sen. Sanders has not. He has met with us. He has stood with us. He has listened to us. He has promised us he would help, and he has helped.""

1869,"SEN. SANDERS QUIZZES BUDGET NOMINEE
  President Bush's nominee to head the White House budget office testified at a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday. Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Budget Committee, questioned former Rep. Jim Nussle about tax breaks for the rich (Bush and Nussle are for them, Sanders and the majority of Americans are not). 
   The senator also cited troubling statistics about the number of Americans who have fallen into poverty since Bush took office. And he brought up the growing gap between the rich and the poor, a gap that is wider now than at any time since The Great Depression. 
   It is uncertain when the Senate will vote on Nussle, who was the House Budget Committee chairman between 2001 and 2006. Congressional Quarterly reported after the confirmation hearing that the next step in the confirmation process could turn on a meeting next week when President Bush and Democratic leaders of Congress are scheduled to discuss appropriations bills and Bush's threats to veto them.

                 Department to Rule on Chinese Candle Imports      Syracuse candle industry continually hurt by circumvention efforts by Chinese candle makers and U S  importers to avoid antidumping tariffs                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton joined today with a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues  calling on the U S  Department of Commerce to consider the local candle industry before issuing a determination on Chinese candle imports on Tuesday   The senators are concerned about aggressive efforts by Chinese candle producers to circumvent an Antidumping Duty Order on petroleum wax candles and thus avoid paying the 108 3  duty imposed on their illegal dumping            Nobody knows better than the people of Central New York how the Chinese don  t always play by the rules  especially when it comes to trade     Schumer said    This is yet another example of Syracuse being devastated by China  s unfair trade practices  It is vitally important that the Department of Commerce take a particularly close look at the petition before them               We have such a proud history of candle making in New York and we must prevent foreign manufacturers from unfairly seeking a greater market share in the U S  We hope that the Department of Commerce will look at the facts and understand the impact on  our local candle manufacturers as a result of these dubious and unfair practices     Senator Clinton said           Syracuse used to be one of the world  s prime producers of candles  yet their market has steadily declined since the early 1980s    primarily due to Chinese trade practices   Since the Antidumping Duty Order was issued in 1986  widespread efforts to evade the policies set forth in the Order have tripled the number of imported Chinese candles that should be subject to the Antidumping Duty Order  based on their composition    Congress passed anti circumvention laws to protect the integrity of our antidumping laws   and when our antidumping laws have been violated  it is important to ensure a remedy is in place so our trade rules are not weakened             The International Trade Commission  ITC   in its Second Sunset Review of the Antidumping Duty Order issued in July 2005  concluded that the number of production and related workers in the U S  candle industry had declined by 13 5 percent between 1999 and 2004  In its review  the ITC also confirmed that the U S  industry is suffering injury as a result of these practices and determined that revocation of the antidumping duty order covering petroleum wax candles from China would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time           Last year Senators Clinton and Schumer wrote a letter urging the Department of Commerce to take action and investigate allegations of the Chinese circumvention efforts while expressing great concern towards the potentially irreparable harm these efforts could cause on the U S  candle industry    most notably the candle production in and around Syracuse             A copy of the Senators   letter is attached          May 18  2006      The Honorable Carlos M  Gutierrez  Secretary of Commerce  United States Department of Commerce  14th Street and Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20230      Dear Secretary Gutierrez       Last year  many of us wrote to you expressing our support for the Department of Commerce  s consideration of a petition related to the composition of Chinese candles  specifically whether Chinese candle producers and U S  importers are attempting to circumvent the 108 3 percent Antidumping Duty Order imposed on petroleum wax candles from China          It is our understanding that the Department is prepared to issue a determination by May 23  2006  on one or two of the petitions filed by the National Candle Association  NCA  in response to the Chinese circumvention   We urge you to proceed in accordance with the Department  s precedent with respect to later developed merchandise anti circumvention investigations   It concerns us that any change to the precedent would likely result in the weakening of U S  trade laws  thereby making it difficult for U S  companies to receive legitimate remedies under the statute          As you know  the Antidumping Duty Order on petroleum wax candles from the People  s Republic of China  PRC  was first issued in 1986   Since then    particularly during the last eight years   circumvention efforts by Chinese producers have more than tripled the number of imported candles that some erroneously allege are not subject to the Order   According to the NCA  the Chinese efforts include the importation of petroleum and palm vegetable blended wax candles  in which the palm or vegetable wax is purported to be the majority ingredient   If the Chinese continue to circumvent the Order  it will cause irreparable harm to these companies and to domestic candle producers in general          In our letter to you last year  we expressed our sincere concern that continued circumvention by the Chinese would cause irreparable harm to U S  candle producers   The International Trade Commission  ITC   in its Second Sunset Review of the Antidumping Duty Order issued in July 2005  agreed with our concerns   The ITC report confirmed that the U S  industry is suffering injury  and determined   that revocation of the antidumping duty order covering petroleum wax candles from China would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time     In that decision  the ITC clarified the language of its original Determination  and made it clear that it had never intended to exclude mixed wax candles  meaning vegetable wax candles  from the Order  thereby removing the basis for a Determination that mixed wax candles are outside the scope of the Order          In its July 2005 Review  the ITC also concluded that the number of production and related workers in the U S  candle industry   declined by 13 5 percent between 1999 and 2004      Even our hard working and increasingly efficient American candle producers and employees cannot fairly compete with illegal dumping and circumvention by Chinese candle producers          As you know  the antidumping statute and the Department s regulations provide for anti circumvention proceedings to include later developed merchandise within the scope of the Order   These are the procedures that Congress intended to be used   According to the ITC  at the time of the original Candles decision  mixed wax candles comprised of more than 50 percent vegetable wax did not exist in the U S  market and did not become commercially available until the late 1990s and early 2000s  In the late 1990s and early 2000s  U S  companies and the Chinese developed new processes and formulas that enabled the production of candles made of 50 percent or more vegetable wax and petroleum wax that looks the same  smells the same  burns the same  performs the same  and is used for the same purposes as today s state of the art candles that are made of 100 percent petroleum wax  Consequently  the ITC in effect concluded that mixed wax candles must be considered later developed merchandise under the anti circumvention statute because they were not available in the marketplace in 1986 at the time of the original investigation          It is important to ensure hard working American candle producers and employees are able to trade on a level playing field   Therefore  we urge you to proceed in accordance with the Department  s precedent  and if it is found that the Order is being circumvented  we urge you to progress in accordance with the law          Sincerely       Tom Coburn  Blanche L  Lincoln  Mike DeWine

1916,"THE WEEK IN REVIEW
  In Burlington, Vermont teachers and school administrators vented their frustration over the No Child Left Behind law that Congress is reconsidering. With home heating prices rising to record highs, Senator Bernie Sanders told a Brattleboro audience that he has won bipartisan backing for legislation to provide another $1 billion to help people pay their bills. After workers in St. Albans contacted the senator, Sanders sought a Labor Department probe into a Virginia company's plan to slash wages for employees working on a huge backlog in citizenship applications. On Capitol Hill, the Senate environment committee braced for a vote on climate change legislation. 
   No Child Left Behind Angry teachers and school administrators criticized the 5-year-old law's standardized testing mandates and urged Sanders to revise the law or wipe it off the books. Sanders ""has a way of spotting issues that are ripe for a public pounding"" and ""he hit the mark again"" The Burlington Free Press editorialized on Friday. Sanders is a member of the education committee that is considering reauthorizing the law. To read the article or watch video, click here or here. To read the editorial, click here. 
   Home Heating Assistance As soaring fuel prices stretch household budgets beyond the breaking point, Sanders said he will introduce legislation to provide $1 billion in emergency home heating assistance. Sanders called for the boost in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that provides critical help to 5.8 million senior citizens on fixed-incomes and low-income families with children, including some 20,000 households in Vermont. ""This is an emergency,"" he said. ""We ought to treat it like one."" He told a gathering in Brattleboro that his bill already has bipartisan backing.

   Immigration Jobs The Department of Labor is investigating whether a company that employs workers who process citizenship applications in Vermont and California violated federal regulations by cutting their pay when a new contract with Stanley Associates begins Monday. Two hundred employees in Vermont, half the workforce, will have their earnings slashed, Sanders said in a letter to Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao. He asked for the investigation into whether the Virginia-based contractor is violating a federal law guaranteeing that federal contract workers receive prevailing wages and benefits. Ironically, these are the same workers the federal government is counting on to alleviate huge application backlogs. ""Not only is it wrong for the workers, it's wrong for what we're trying to do for homeland security,"" Sanders told WCAX-TV. To read more, click here. 
   Global Warming As the Senate environment committee made eleventh-hour changes in climate change legislation scheduled for a vote in the coming week, Sanders staked out his position in a column published by The Nation. ""The truth rarely uttered in Washington is that with strong governmental leadership the crisis of global warming is not only solvable, it can be done while improving the standard of living of the people of this country and others around the world and it can be done with the knowledge and technology that we have today; future advances will only make the task easier,"" Sanders wrote.

   Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies  TTHUD  FY08 Appropriations Bill  which includes  200 000 for the City of Newburghs Armory District Revitalization Plan   1 million for the replacement of buses in the Westchester County Bee Line Bus System   1 million for the City of Poughkeepsie Transit Hub  and  400 000 for the Haverstraw Ferry Terminal   The committee has also approved the FY08 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Bill  which includes  750 000 for Dutchess County for the Renovation of the Franklin D  Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum   The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process   Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this years spending bill    This is great news for the Hudson Valley  Schumer said   The Newburgh project will revitalize and restore the Armory District  fueling the exciting economic development taking place in that wonderful Hudson River city   The new environmentally friendly bus fleet in Westchester puts that county at the cutting edge of environmentally sound mass transit  The improved ferry operations in Haverstraw supports a vital new transportation option for Rockland County commuters  And the new transit hub for Poughkeepsie will significantly improve commuting services for Dutchess County and the whole Hudson Valley  Finally  these funds will polish the jewel that is the FDR library  and make it the national treasure it ought to be     This funding is certainly great news for the Hudson Valley Region  These funds for the Revitalization Planning and Development of Newburghs Armory District will further assist with the redevelopment of their facilities  helping to improve the neighborhood both physically and economically  I am pleased that the funds for the Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will facilitate the construction of a centralized public transit center that will help to alleviate disruptive traffic congestion and promote public transportation that can reduce harmful green house gas emissions   I am also very pleased that funds will be coming to the Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus System  providing needed support to replace out dated buses that will decrease emissions  giving residents a cleaner  greener ride  Senator Clinton said   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive funds to increase parking capacity  improve passenger waiting facilities  and increase access from Manhattan   which will greatly contribute to the economic growth of the area   I am also pleased that we could secure approval for funds to renovate the Franklin D  Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Dutchess County   Although it is a tremendous source of tourist revenue  the Roosevelt Presidential Library has had little renovation since it opened in 1941   These funds will help to renew this local treasure as well as expand the museum and research facilities    The City of Newburghs Armory District Revitalization Planning and Development program will receive  200 000 of federal funds to be used for planning and design efforts within the Citys Armory District   Implementation will include corridor planning utilizing the principles of urban design  the development of architectural designs  and mixed use commercial development planning   The support of this initiative via the Economic Development Initiative  EDI  will aid the redevelopment of this deteriorating corridor   Coordinating and planning the improvement for this corridor will help ensure economic vitality and neighborhood restoration  as well as support current and future private rehabilitation occurring in the corridor   Newburgh is located in Orange County    The Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus Systems Low Emission ADA Accessible Replacement Buses project will receive  1 million of federal funds to replaces buses to decrease emissions   Westchester County proposes the replacement of 114 over age buses in the County public transit fleet  30 of which are not ADA accessible   This money will fund busses ordered in 2006 through 2008  to be delivered in 2007 through 2009    The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive  400 000 of federal funds to upgrade the ferry service to Lower Manhattan   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal currently serves the Haverstraw Ossining ferry  and will serve the Haverstraw Yonkers Lower Manhattan ferry service in the near future   Currently  there are limited parking and waiting facilities available at the site for passengers   These funds will be used to make parking and landside improvements  such as a climate controlled facility large enough to accommodate up to 100 passengers   When it is time for the ferry to move to their future  permanent home  several years from now   the passenger waiting facility structure can be relocated    The City of Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will receive  1 million of federal funds to build a combination Public Transit Hub and Parking Deck in the central business district to serve as a hub for city  county and private bus riders and provide resident parking   The City of Poughkeepsie is in the planning stages for a Public Transit Hub to be located on a City owned surface parking lot in the central business district  The structure will serve two much needed purposes by providing parking to residents and visitors and by serving as a transportation hub for bus riders on city  county  and intercity privately operated bus services   This project combines transit and economic development components  The first floor of the facility will serve the bus systems and their riders  and the upper floors will provide public parking spaces in support of the City s revitalization and redevelopment of the Luckey  Platt Building  the center piece of Main Street redevelopment efforts and a National Historic Landmark  The 150 000 square foot building is currently being redeveloped by private owners as a mixed retail market rate residential project    The bus systems and their riders are in dire need of a convenient and suitable location for downtown riders to wait for a bus or to transfer to another bus  Currently  riders must assemble at an on street transfer point bus stop  The current location does not accommodate the number of buses that are at that location during peak times  and riders have to wait at the curb or in a limited number of bus shelters   Within the Hub  the ground floor of the facility will house the transit hub with covered spaces for passengers and buses to enter  wait  and exit  Bus service will be maintained at its current location  but the transfer point for all buses will become the Transit Hub  Shuttle bus service from the Transit Hub to the Metro North and Amtrak Station may be an option as the City redevelops  Buses from the City Bus system  the Dutchess County Loop bus system  and regional intercity bus services will use the facility   Dutchess County will receive  750 000 for the Renovation of the Franklin D  Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum  The Roosevelt Presidential Library opened in 1941 as the first of Americas presidential libraries  and houses 17 million pages of documents and artifacts from 385 different collections

and related technology   Keeping nuclear weapons and material out of the hands of terrorists and rogue states is a vital national security priority   said Senator Obama   We need to build and sustain a truly global effort  including providing ample resources for the world s nuclear watchdog agency  to ensure that stockpiles of nuclear material are secure and to prevent additional countries from acquiring nuclear weapons   I applaud the Senate Appropriations Committee for its decision to provide additional support to the IAEA to help keep the world s most dangerous weapons from falling into the wrong hands    It is in every nation s interest to strengthen the IAEA s capability to promote nuclear nonproliferation   These additional funds will expand and accelerate the IAEA s efforts to assist countries with securing nuclear materials while helping upgrade technical analysis of samples obtained during inspections   Sustained engagement with our international partners on nuclear nonproliferation will be required to address one of the great challenges of the 21st century   said U S  Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE    Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is vital to our national security and global stability   Durbin said   These funds will ensure that the agency charged with checking the spread of nuclear weapons and weapon components  the International Atomic Energy Agency  has the tools and resources to continue this important work  It s not just in our nation s best interest that IAEA is able to fulfill its mission   it s a global imperative   The text of the March 28  2008 letter is below  March 28  2008 The Honorable Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Subcommittee on  State  Foreign Operations  and Related Programs  Senate Committee on Appropriations  Washington  DC  20510 The Honorable Judd Gregg  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on  State  Foreign Operations  and Related Programs  Senate Committee on Appropriations   Washington  DC  20510 Dear Mr  Chairman and Senator Gregg  We respectfully request that you increase the FY2009 budget for Nonproliferation  Anti terrorism  Demining and Related Programs  NADR  to provide an additional  10 million for voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA  to improve its ability to keep nuclear weapons out of the wrong hands by bolstering its analytic capability and its efforts to help countries to secure nuclear material   We know Al Qaeda has made it a goal to acquire a nuclear weapon  If a sophisticated terrorist group obtained the right amount of plutonium or highly enriched uranium  it could potentially construct a crude nuclear device that could destroy the heart of any major city in the United States  While significant progress has been made in securing nuclear materials  there are still large stockpiles that remain vulnerable to theft  The IAEA plays an important role in keeping nuclear materials out of the wrong hands by providing international guidelines for improving security and assisting countries with implementation of these guidelines  Yet the IAEA s efforts in this area are chronically constrained by a small budget and an undersized staff  Increasing the voluntary contribution for nuclear security by  5 million in FY2009 would enable the IAEA to expand and accelerate its critical efforts to help secure nuclear materials  The IAEA also plays a key role in international nonproliferation efforts by conducting inspections of nuclear facilities to ensure that nuclear material is not being diverted for military purposes  The other  5 million of the additional funding should be used to strengthen the capabilities of the IAEA s Safeguards Analytical Laboratory  which provides technical analysis of samples obtained during inspections  The laboratory s infrastructure is aging and the additional funding would play an important role in upgrading the laboratory so it can meet future requirements  We believe that the additional funding for the IAEA represents a sound investment in enhancing our national security  The U S  contribution to the IAEA was included in the highest rating category for effectiveness in a review of government programs conducted by the U S  Office of Management and Budget due to substantial progress in achieving sound long term goals  Thank you for your consideration of this request  Sincerely  Barack Obama                                                                           Chuck Hagel  Richard Durbin                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and

1804,"SENATE APPROVES MENTAL HEALTH BILL, VERMONT PARITY LAW PRESERVED
  The Senate last night passed legislation that requires insurers to provide equal benefits for mental and physical illnesses while preserving Vermont's stronger mental health parity law. 
   The legislation, authored by Sen. Edward Kennedy, the Senate health committee chairman, initially included language that would have watered down Vermont's law, which is the strongest in the country. Senators Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy had written a letter to Kennedy urging him to safeguard mental health insurance programs in Vermont and other states that exceed nationwide standards set by the bill.
   ""This legislation will help provide mental health care for millions of Americans and preserve Vermont's position as a national leader in the field,"" said Sanders, who helped shepherd the bill to passage as a member of the health committee. ""This is a perfect example of Vermont's congressional delegation working closely with mental health advocates in Vermont to achieve an outcome that benefits both Vermont and the country.""
   ""Congress has worked on guaranteeing mental health parity for more than a decade,"" said Leahy. ""After years of hard work, we are one step closer to ensuring that all those who suffer from mental health issues receive the benefits they need and deserve.  Vermont has been at the front of the pack in this effort, so it was important to us to fix this legislation to support Vermont's standards, instead of undermining them.""
   Under the legislation, all self- funded employer-based health insurance plans that offer mental health benefits would have to meet the federal requirements, but states could set stronger standards. The legislation has wide support from mental health advocates, insurers and businesses. It would protect mental health benefits for 113 million people.
   The measure had been approved by the committee in March, after Sanders won assurances from Chairman Kennedy that stronger state laws in Vermont and elsewhere would not be preserved. After months of negotiations, the lead sponsors of the bill brokered an agreement removing the preemption clause from the bill altogether.

1747,"SEN. SANDERS, FCC COMMISSIONER STUMP FOR INDEPENDENT MEDIA
  It's not every day that Vermonters get a say in rewriting the Federal Communications Commission rules governing who can own newspapers, radio stations, network affiliates and cable TV systems in their own communities. But starting this year, ""Everything is up for grabs."" 
   At least, that's the word from FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein, a leading advocate for the reform of U.S. media ownership laws. Adelstein comes to the state this week, at the invitation of Senator Bernie Sanders, to hear what Vermonters have to say about the effects of media consolidation on their communities and on the democratic process.  
   ""The law says we're supposed to serve the public interest, not the interests of the corporate giants we oversee,"" says Adelstein, one of only two Democrats on the five-member regulatory panel. ""So, there's no better opportunity to determine what we should be doing than actually talking to the public about what they think is in their best interest."" 
   By law, the FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years. But those reviews are often unduly influenced by large, corporate interests, Adelstein notes. Media reform activists from across the political spectrum have long complained about the pernicious effects of allowing print and broadcast outlets to be consolidated in the hands of fewer and fewer large, multinational corporations. They contend that media consolidation reduces the diversity of voices over the airwaves and limits debates on important and controversial issues. 
   For example, one-third of America's independently owned television stations have disappeared since 1975. Today, just five corporations own all the broadcast networks; 90 percent of the top-50 cable TV networks now produce three-quarters of all prime-time programming. 
   Adelstein's visit to Vermont is part of his nationwide tour to solicit public feedback on the FCC's current rules. Although Sanders' town meeting is not an ""official"" congressional hearing, Adelstein says the public comments will become part of the FCC's record and will be considered when the full commission deliberates on its rules later this year. 
   This week's town meeting, at St. Michael's College in Colchester, is also an opportunity for Sanders to unveil his soon-to-be-introduced legislation -- the ""Media Ownership Reform Act,"" or MORA, which he calls ""the most sweeping and comprehensive media reform legislation ever introduced in Congress. 
   ""Over the years, basically all of the responsibilities that were asked of media owners have been diminished. There's virtually nothing left,"" Sanders asserts. ""And now, their only job is to make as much money as possible in any way they can."" 
   A key feature of MORA would be to restore the so-called ""Fairness Doctrine"" of the 1934 Communications Act, which once required broadcast licensees to ensure that all coverage of pressing and controversial issues be balanced and fair. But the FCC eliminated the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, under pressure from President Reagan. 
   ""It doesn't mean that Rush Limbaugh would have to give two sides of the story,"" Sanders tells Seven Days, ""but it does mean that you can't have what you have now, which is networks in which 95 to 98 percent of the broadcasting is one point of view, usually right-wing extremism."" 
   MORA would also restore the caps on broadcast ownership. Media reformers argue that such a move would help increase station ownership by women and minorities. As Adelstein points out, minorities make up 30 percent of the nation's population but own just 3 percent of all broadcast licenses. 
   In addition, MORA would prevent one company from owning broadcast stations that reach more than 35 percent of the U.S. television market. It would re-establish the national cap that prevents a single company from owning more than 5 percent of the nation's AM and FM radio stations. It would restrict companies from owning more than a certain number of stations within a single market. And it would prevent a company from owning both a newspaper and a broadcast station in the same market. 
   ""You should be asking people in your community how they'd feel if The Burlington Free Press were able to buy broadcast outlets in radio and TV,"" Adelstein says. ""That's something to think about."" 
   In fact, the Gannett Company, which owns The Burlington Free Press, has been leading the charge to relax the FCC's cross-ownership ban, according to published reports. 
   Finally, Sanders' new legislation would require more rigorous reviews of broadcast licenses when they're up for renewal. License renewals would be reduced from once every eight years to once every three years, and licenses could be revoked for failure to serve ""the public interest,"" rather than just ""rubber-stamped every eight years"" the way they are now, Adelstein says. 
   ""We virtually never deny a radio or TV license because they're not meeting the public interest,"" he adds. ""It's time to beef that up and give the public some accountability."" 
   The effects of media consolidation are well documented. In January 2002, police and fire officials in Minot, N.D., had trouble notifying the public about a toxic chemical spill, in part because all the TV stations were off the air and the ""local"" radio stations were playing piped-in music from remote locations, with no local DJs. 
   But Sanders says the consequences of media consolidation go beyond such isolated incidents and go to heart of the democratic process. He argues that during the lead-up to the war in Iraq, for example, the mainstream media became ""a cheerleader for the White House"" and presented only one point of view: support for the war. 
   ""If you're concerned about the war in Iraq, if you're concerned about global warming, health care, the economy, education, whatever it may be, you must be concerned about media ownership,"" Sanders suggests. ""Because people make decisions based on what they see, hear and read. If they're not getting differing points of view, then it's hard for them to make good decisions.""

1745,"VERMONT DELEGATION SECURES KING MONUMENT PLEDGE
  The Vermont congressional delegation has been assured by the Martin Luther King Foundation that American granite will be used in a monument to the civil rights leader in the nation's capital. 
   Vermont granite suppliers will be eligible to compete for contracts that will be announced in the near future, according to Harry E. Johnson Sr., the president and chief executive officer of the memorial foundation. The assurance that a majority of the granite will be American came in a conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) after efforts by the delegation began this fall.
   Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sanders and Representative Peter Welch (D-Vt.) had contacted the foundation to express concern over reports that the project would be built with Chinese granite.
   Sanders said, ""It is very good news that Vermont granite companies and Vermont granite workers will have a chance to contribute to this memorial to one of our nation's true heroes. Dr. King spent much of his life fighting for the working people of all colors in our country, it is appropriate that those working men and women provide the majority of granite for this memorial. While we would have preferred to have all the granite for this monument produced locally, today's news is a major step forward from where we were when this issue was first brought to our attention.""
   Leahy said, ""Barre is home to some of the finest granite in the world - fitting for a memorial that will be built for one of our nation's most visionary and courageous figures. He was a catalyst for momentous change that brought America more in line with America's ideals. As the grandson of two Barre-area stone carvers I am especially pleased that Vermont craftspeople and stone will be given due consideration for this important work.""
   Welch said, ""This is a significant step in the right direction. Barre is second to none in producing the finest granite in the world so this is a great opportunity for our state. Our country's memorials should not simply memorialize great heroes and historic events, but reflect who we are as a nation. It is only fitting that local granite is used for a majority of this memorial.""
   In a September 26, 2007, letter, the delegation wrote to the foundation to express a ""strong belief that this great American monument should be built with American products.""
   The letter also extolled the benefits of Vermont granite. ""Barre, Vermont, often referred to as the 'Granite Capital of the World' produces the world's finest granite. Barre granite has been used in some of the most significant monuments and memorials around the country, including the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. Furthermore, Barre manufacturers provide their employees with excellent wages and ensure the highest safety standards at their facilities.""

withdraw her appointment and select an appointee who will actively implement Title X as intended by Congress under current law  the Senators wrote      Dr  Orr has been a vocal opponent of contraception equity  while often urging the Administration to put personal beliefs before facts  Prior to joining the Bush Administration  Dr  Orr was a director for an organization whose ideologically driven agenda opposed the scientifically based FDA approval of Plan B   In this position  Dr  Orr applauded a Bush proposal to halt requiring all health insurance plans for federal employees to cover an extensive range of birth control  Dr  Orr also encouraged President Bush to overrule scientists and doctors to revoke FDA approval for RU 486    Last November  the Senators joined eleven of their colleagues in opposing the nomination of another anti contraception advocate  Eric Keroack to the same position which lead to his resignation  The appointment of Dr  Orr continues the Bush Administration tradition of placing ideology before science  At the urging of the Administration  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  repeatedly blocked the over the counter application of the emergency contraceptive Plan B despite the overwhelming support of the agency s own scientific advisory panel  The agency finally suggested approval only after a years long fight with Congress led by Senators Patty Murray  D WA  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY    The trumping of science by ideology is also illustrated with President Bush s veto of scientifically backed stem cell research     The following is the text of the letter to Secretary Leavitt    October 18  2007    The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  DC 20201   Dear Secretary Leavitt    We write to express our deep concern over the appointment of Dr  Susan Orr to be Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs      The office to which Dr  Orr has been appointed gives her the authority over Title X which funds low cost  confidential family planning and health screening services that would otherwise be out of reach for millions of Americans   Dr  Orr would also oversee counseling and providing information to women on a broad range of family planning and reproductive services  including contraception     Dr  Orr has a troubling history of opposing federal funding for contraception  which is counter to the mission of the office to which she has been appointed  In 2001  she spoke in favor of a Bush administration plan to drop a requirement that health insurance for federal employees must cover birth control  Were quite pleased because fertility is not a disease  she said at the time on contraception  Its not a medical necessity that you have it    Dr  Orr also publicly urged President Bush to overrule scientists and doctors to revoke FDA approval of RU 486  Before joining the Bush Administration  she had been a senior director of an organization that labeled the scientifically based  FDA approval of Plan B a grave threat to womens health    Unfortunately  this nomination is part of a disturbing Administration pattern of disregarding science and placing ideology ahead of sound decisions on womens health  In fact  last November  many of us opposed the nomination of Eric Keroack to the same position because of similar concerns      The American people deserve a qualified public health expert who will ensure that the needs of women and families are met  In light of Dr  Orrs ideological record on Title X services  we urge you to withdraw her appointment and select an appointee who will actively implement Title X as intended by Congress under current law    Sincerely

   ""As everyone here knows very well, all of us in Vermont support having a secure and safe border. There is no question about that. 
   ""However, the Department of Homeland Security's heavy-handed decisions fly in the face of logic and the work of Congress. This decision is going to harm the strong friendship and trade relationship between Vermont and Canada.
   ""Let's remember, in 2006, Canadians made more than 644,000 visits to Vermont, spending $89 million. In the same year, Vermont residents made 176,000 visits to Canada, spending $56 million. In other words, this relationship and a smooth operation on the border are very important to our state. 
   ""With little notification to Vermonters and those visiting Vermont and other northern states, this decision is going to cause more confusion than it will help secure our borders.
   ""I am pleased to say that our entire delegation is working closely on this issue in general, and just this morning I joined Senator Leahy's request to Homeland Security to continue accepting oral declarations and government-issued photo ID cards as proof of citizenship for Western hemisphere citizens until full WHTI implementation in 2009. 
  ""At a hearing I held this summer, we heard directly from citizens experiencing unacceptably long lines and delays at the border. What is going to happen when we add these new burdens on Vermonters, Vermont businesses, and our visitors?
   ""Why, when Congress has given Homeland Security more time to implement the technological and logistical hurdles of this plan are they pressing forward?
   ""We here in Vermont want a plan that works for our citizens, our visitors, and the Vermont economy. The Department of Homeland Security does not seem to share those priorities. They need to sit down and work with the stakeholders to develop a plan and a timeline that works and is realistic.""

1927,"CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
  As Verizon Wireless moves ahead in Vermont to acquire the competing mobile phone company Unicel, Senator Bernie Sanders has asked the Federal Communications Commission to step in to protect the interests of Vermont consumers and businesses. If Verizon is to be handed a virtual Vermont monopoly, the telecommunications giant must guarantee that it will provide cell service throughout the state. ""We should ask them to provide universal geographic coverage. They should make sure that all of our people have access to cell phone service in every town and every part of the state."" Sanders said. The senator also has voiced concerns about incompatible cell phone technologies. For example, would all cell phones work in an emergency? Would a skier visiting from out of state be able to make calls from Stowe on their iPhone? He wants the FCC to place conditions on the proposed merger if it is allowed to go through.

  A Senate panel on Thursday narrowly approved a global warming bill that Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) opposed because it would not reduce emissions of greenhouse gases as much as scientists say is necessary to stop catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate. ""This bill is a step in the right direction, but it simply does not go far enough to do what scientists tell us must be done to stop global warming,"" Sanders said. ""If we are not extremely bold and aggressive, this planet faces a catastrophe in the years to come.""  
   Sanders worked with Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) to strengthen the bill in behind-the-scenes negotiations over the past two weeks. At today's subcommittee meeting, Sanders also offered amendments that were supported by all of the major national environmental organizations. 
   Added to the bill was a Sanders provision that would encourage automobile manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency. To be eligible for a pool of new funds to produce more fuel efficient cars, auto makers first would have to manufacture vehicles that get at least 35 miles per gallon.
   The subcommittee turned down proposals to carve out resources for solar, wind and other renewable energy sources in the bill that guarantees whopping sums for coal ($324 billion) and car makers ($232 billion). It blocked a Sanders amendment to make utilities dramatically reduce emissions from new coal-fired power plants. It voted down an amendment to make polluters pay for carbon emissions starting in 2026 instead of 2036. The majority also failed to set a goal of reducing emissions of heat trapping gases by mid-century by 80 percent - the amount scientists say must be achieved to be effective. The bill calls for at most a 63 percent reduction by 2050, not enough to matter according to experts.
   ""I am proud that we pushed to improve the bill. It is stronger today than it was when it was unveiled two weeks ago. I appreciate the support for my amendment to improve fuel economy standards for cars. I look forward to making the bill better. The American people favor bolder action than this bill to prevent a catastrophe for our planet. I hope grass-roots activists will put pressure on senators to pass a stronger bill out of the full environment committee."" 
   Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder praised Sanders' efforts to strengthen the bill. ""Senator Sanders is providing much-needed leadership and giving Vermonters reason to be proud. He has been the Senate's strongest advocate for responding to global warming in a way that's commensurate with what science says is needed. We plan to do all we can to make sure his important voice is heard.""

867,February 12  2007 Senator Clinton Welcomes HUD Commitment to Review Sale of Starrett City

                     Calls on Secretary to Include Tenants  Concerns in any Review   Senator Expressed Concern to HUD Secretary Jackson Over the Sale of Starrett City Housing Development Last Week                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed a commitment by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  that he will  aggressively  review the  1 3 billion sale of Starrett City but said that any review must include consideration of a number of serious concerns held by tenants and others  Last week Senator Clinton joined her colleague Senator Schumer to call on the HUD Secretary to conduct a thorough assessment of how to maintain the long term affordability of Starrett City before the sale is completed            HUD has a responsibility to approve or disapprove of the transfer of property like this  I am pleased to hear that Secretary Jackson has committed to aggressively review the sale however I hope that the Secretary s review will take our concerns into account   Senator Clinton said   I remain extremely concerned that the outcome of this sale will be increased rents  forcing many people out of their homes         The full text of the Senators  letter is below       February 9  2007      The Honorable Alphonso Jackson  Secretary  United States Department of Housing and Urban Development  451 Seventh Street S W   Washington  D C  20410      Dear Mr  Secretary       Spring Creek Towers  also known as Starrett City  is one of the largest federally subsidized housing developments in the country   With nearly 5 900 units  Starrett City provides affordable housing to over 14 000 seniors and working families            Opened in 1975  Starrett City was created under New York State s Mitchell Lama program and financed with a Section 236 mortgage loan  at one percent interest   In exchange for participating in Section 236  investors were required to make the units available to low  and moderate income households throughout the term of the mortgage   Without question  this important government and private sector partnership has made it possible for thousands of New Yorkers to call Starrett City home              However  the owners of the complex  Starrett City Associates  plan to sell ownership and management of the buildings to the highest bidder   It has come to our attention that the real estate company Clipper Equity holds the highest bid  at  1 3 billion   We believe it is critical that before a sale of the development is completed  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  must conduct a thorough assessment of how to maintain the long term affordability of Starrett City                 We are concerned that the extremely high sale price will force the new owners to make changes that prove to be onerous to current and future tenants of Starrett City   For example  the new owner could choose to opt out of the Mitchell Lama program or to prepay the Section 236 mortgage  leading to price pressures which  over time  could reduce the overall affordability of the development  These are legitimate concerns  and our offices have heard directly from hundreds of residents who believe this transfer in ownership will result in significantly higher rents  a reduction of services  and undue pressure for tenants to relocate                It is our understanding that HUD has a statutory responsibility to approve or disapprove any transfer of a property that has any type of federal funding or assistance   More specifically  we understand that you are charged with looking at a prospective buyer s portfolio of properties and consider the condition of those properties  the treatment of residents with regard to rent subsidies  claims of harassment  evictions  financial issues with local jurisdictions  among other issues  It is our hope that you will appropriately scrutinize the prospective buyer to ensure that they are capable of managing a development with such extensive federal subsidies                 Given your oversight of the sale and your mission to preserve affordable housing  we are hopeful that HUD will make the approval of this sale contingent upon the new owner s commitment to long term affordability   We urge you to take the necessary steps to ensure that this housing complex remains affordable and continues to be an important part of preserving the middle class for New York City                 We are hopeful your department will act in the best interest of the more than 14 000 residents who are part of this economically and racially diverse success story   We look forward to working with you to honor the history of this important community  as well as our shared belief that all hard working families deserve an affordable place to live          Sincerely yours       Charles E  Schumer                                           Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0

                    Mr  President  I find it almost hard to believe that we are here on the floor of the United States Senate arguing over the necessity for an increase in the minimum wage  I am strongly supportive of Senator Kennedy  s amendment  proud to cosponsor it  and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of it and to oppose the second degree amendment   Now  this amendment does not go as far as I or Senator Kennedy and others would have preferred   It raises the minimum wage to  6 25 an hour  far short of the  7 25 an hour that Senator Kennedy and I and 48 other Senators proposed in March  but we could never get a vote on that  Now  this amendment  however  should have even greater support than the 50 cosponsors we had last March  It should pass unanimously out of this body  Fifty senators just last March supported an increase to  7 25 and now we have cut the increase with a hope that we can get  number one  the vote we are hoping to get on this appropriations bill  and  number two  an overwhelmingly bipartisan passage          Since March  we have seen even more evidence as to why this is critical  At a time when working families are struggling to make ends meet  it s critically important that we do something  Senator Kennedy has called this amendment a down payment on what is truly needed          Today the Federal minimum wage is  5 15 an hour  an amount that has not been increased since 1997  Now  unfortunately  the same cannot be said of the cost of living   Over the past three months  according to the federal Department of Labor  inflation has increased more rapidly in the New York metro area than any time since early in 1990  We also know that the poverty rate is going back up and that the fact is there has not been one net new private sector job created in the last 4 1 2 years                                    This chart  this should be a rebuke to all of us   It shows that we have increased the number of people living in poverty  In 2000  we had 31 6 million  which is far too many   And now we re at 37 million  up 5 4 million  Why  Because we re not creating jobs and many of the jobs that are in the economy are no longer paying wages that families can live on and can work their way out of poverty  So  Mr  President  we know that everything else has gone up  Across America  people are spending 74  more gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by more than 50  this winter  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially poor working people  to cut spending on clothing  health care  and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter  These rising costs and falling wages are illustrated in this chart where heating oil is going up dramatically and the buying power of the minimum wage is going down  And of course we are in the post Katrina phase  which lest we forget  demonstrated in stark terms how so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic disaster  Any setback becomes a major obstacle to being able to pay for gas   pay for food  pay for health care and prescription drugs  pay for tuition  pay for all of the necessities of life  Mr  President  I think that it s hard to stand here on the floor with this amendment before us and not wonder  when will the majority stop giving privileges to the already privileged         At what point is it too much   Never has a political party given so much to so few who needed it so little  And it never ends  You know  we re more than happy to continue to provide tax breaks for the wealthiest among us while we cut the social safety net  while we refuse to raise the minimum wage  Well  shame on us  You know  I think at some point there has to be a recognition that we are tilting the scales dramatically against average Americans   Middle class wages are stagnant  Health care costs are going up and the number of the uninsured is going up because people who work hard for a living are no longer offered insurance or cannot afford to pay what it costs  Pension and retirement security is at risk  There s something really wrong with this picture         With all due respect to those who have a different economic philosophy  rich people did not make America great  I m all for rich people  Ever since my husband got out of office and got into the private sector  I think it s great  I never knew how much the President really liked us  He can t give us enough tax cuts  I have nothing against rich people  That s part of the American dream  But with all due respect  it is not rich people who made America great  It is the vast American middle class  It is the upward mobility of people who thought they could do better than their parents         For more than 100 years we have worked hard to make sure the deck was not stacked against the average American  Teddy Roosevelt understood that if we didn t have a fair playing field  if people were permitted to monopolize capital and labor  we would have rich people  but the vast majority would never get ahead  He began to advocate for    and accomplish   a fair economic system  As we moved through the 20th century  we saw adjustments made  We saw Franklin Roosevelt who understood that sometimes the difficulties of life strike any of us and that a fair and just society would try to provide a little help so that people overwhelmed by circumstances often beyond their control could keep going and raise their children and plan for the future   And we put in a lot of government programs to make sure that we had a balance of power  a balance of power between capital and labor  between management and employees  And it worked really  really well  The history of the economic prosperity of the  American middle class in the 20th century is the greatest example of what can happen if a democracy where people  s energies are freed so that they can compete between themselves  but within a framework of rules  I m proud of the progress we made in the 20th century and I  m particularly proud that in the last eight years of the 20th century 22 million people were lifted out of poverty  Where we raised the minimum wage   Where we said to people  you have to work  but if you work we ll make sure you have a fair chance  you and your children   We  ve reversed that progress and it appears as though people are just sleep walking through this chamber and the one on the other side of the Capitol  Don t we see what is happening before our eyes    We are undermining the American dream  We are making it nearly impossible for people to believe that tomorrow will be better than today and yesterday was          These numbers sort of speak for themselves  Look at this  the minimum wage no longer even lifts a family out of poverty  You can go to work 40 hours a week   You can clean the rooms and the toilets in a motel  You can serve the food in a restaurant  You can work in a small factory  You can make that minimum wage and you cannot even get your family out of poverty  What kind of message does that send  The whole idea of America is if you work hard and you play by the rules  you will be successful  You will have a chance to do better         Look at that chart  It speaks for itself   we ve been on a steady slow decline  Even when we were able to get a bipartisan agreement to raise it in 1997  we still didn t get above the poverty line  What message are we sending to millions of hard working Americans  I represent a lot of them working hard for a living  You see them on bicycles in Manhattan delivering food  You see them doing all the hard work of janitorial services at night  In upstate New York  I see them as they get up every day and go to work and believe that they are doing what they should do   What message are we sending them  Too bad  keep working  Don t expect anything for us  we re too busy giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans  Well  that s a choice that is going to be made by this chamber  As far as I can tell it s going to be a choice to vote against the minimum wage and to vote instead for the second degree amendment which is designed not only to defeat Senator Kennedy  s amendment  but to do even more harm to the paychecks of working Americans  I mean  this is what I don t understand  The second degree amendment would deny more than ten million workers the money wage  overtime and equal pay rights by ending individual fair labor standards coverage and raising the threshold for which a business would be held accountable to  1 million from  500 000          In short  and let s make no mistake about this  the second degree amendment would be the end of the 40 hour workweek  So  we can go right back to the end of the 19th century because that s where we re heading  You know  there are those who  bless their hearts  believe that America was better off at the end of the 19th century  when you were told what to do and you had to do it and you didn t have much of a choice about it  I just don t agree with that  I m proud of the progress we made in the 20th century  but I  m just absolutely convinced that some people are trying to head us right back there  Because if it s the end of  the 40 hour workweek and the end of the American weekend because there s no rules on overtime that means a pay cut of  3 000 a year for the median income earner and an  800 pay cut for those earning minimum wage          Employees are already free to offer more flexible schedules under current law  but today if they come in and they tell an employee    Guess what  I need you this weekend  You are going to have to work     they have to offer overtime when the work is more than 40 hours a week  The second degree amendment would undermine that basic protection  So  instead of making it easier for families to spend time together  we basically are going to tell workers that they have to do whatever they are told at the risk of losing their job without any overtime pay or any other compensation         The second degree amendment would also prohibit states from providing stronger wage protections than the federal standard for employees like waiters and waitresses who rely on tips  The amendment removes agency direction and creates a safe haven for violators of consumer protections by prohibiting agencies from assessing fines for most first time reporting violations and preempts states   abilities to enforce these laws  In many states  we happen to think some of those rules need to be enforced  Just like what James Madison said in the Federalist    If men were angels  there would be no need for a government     But we aren t and we never will be  not on this earth         The job of government is to level the playing field  help right that balance because otherwise people are powerless to defend themselves especially when they have to get up every day and go to work to keep body and soul together and to put food on the table and particularly if they are a single parent trying to make due on minimum wage  So  it s disheartening  We could have had an up or down vote on the minimum wage  If you want to vote against it  vote against it  but to introduce a second degree amendment loaded with poison pills against workers and fairness  that speaks louder than anything I could say in this chamber          I think there s going to be a day of reckoning  You can t continue to tilt the scales against the vast majority of the Americans and not be held accountable in the political process  The mask has been ripped off of compassionate conservatism and people see it for what it is  partisan politics to favor the privileged  If that s what we re fighting against in this chamber  then I guess  bring it on because most are on the same side  They want to make sure the deck is not stacked against them  that they ve got a fair chance to compete and that their labor gets a fair return          So  Mr  President  I hope that our colleagues will rally in support of Senator Kennedy  s amendment and vote against the second degree amendment  We should pass an increase in the

416,   Senator Obama s Office Responds to Misleading Harper s Magazine Story   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senator Obama s Office Responds to Misleading Harper s Magazine Story Monday  October 23  2006   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Tommy Vietor  202  997 3462  The latest issue of Harper s Magazine contains a piece titled  BARACK OBAMA INC  The birth of a Washington machine   The story is unfortunately filled with a selective presentation of the facts  innuendo and a cynical assumption of bad faith in our leaders  While we do not doubt the integrity or the intelligence of the piece s author  Ken Silverstein  we feel that our side of the story was not fairly presented  Below are some misleading passages from the piece  and some facts we believe will help tell the full story  Misleading Claim  1  Iraq Harper s Magazine says Obama has changed his rhetoric on Iraq  Silverstein wrote   The calibration of Obama s own political rhetoric has been particularly evident in regard to the war in Iraq   Since taking office  Obama has become far more measured in his position    page 38  Fact  Obama has been consistent   He opposed the war from the start  but decided that once we were in Iraq  we needed to plan our withdrawal carefully  Frank Rich of the New York Times puts it succinctly    On one true test for his party  Iraq   Obama  was consistent from the start  On the long trail to a hotly competitive senatorial primary in Illinois  he repeatedly questioned the rationale for the war before it began         He judged Saddam to pose no immediate threat to America and argued for containment over a war         He hasn t changed  In his new book  he gives a specific date  the end of this year  for beginning   a phased withdrawal of U S  troops           New York Times 10 23 2006     Misleading Claim  2    Favors to the Nuclear Industry Harper s Magazine implies that Obama voted to protect loan guarantees for energy technology on behalf of the nuclear industry   page 37   Fact  Obama voted with 75 other Senators to promote a wide array of innovative energy technologies  The Sununu amendment in question would have eliminated loan guarantees to encourage emerging clean energy technologies  These guarantees encouraged a wide array of renewable fuel   Besides nuclear energy  the guarantees can be used for solar and wind power  hybrid cars  hydrogen fuel cells  carbon sequestration  coal gasification and other technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions  Obama voted against the Sununu amendment because he supports emerging technologies and believes many companies would not pursue advanced research without financial support   In the end  76 senators opposed the amendment    Misleading Claim  3  Support for Other Democrats Harper s Magazine says Obama only gives funds to moderate  establishment Democrats  failing to note that Obama has donated to every Senate Democrat running for office in 2006  Harper s says  Obama s PAC has given to candidates that have been carefully culled and selected by the Democratic establishment on the basis of their marketability as palatable  moderates  even when they are facing more progressive and equally viable challengers   Harper s cites as examples Obama s political donations to Joe Lieberman over Ned Lamont  and Tammy Duckworth over Christine Cegelis   page 37  Fact  Obama donated to every Democratic Senator running for reelection and then contributed to Ned Lamont after he won the primary  Harper s takes exception to Obama s decision to donate money to Senator Lieberman  but fails to note that Obama endorsed Ned Lamont and gave him  5 000 the day after Lamont won the nomination   Obama also donated money to every Senate Democrat up for reelection and to every Democratic challenger in a closely contested Senate race  including Sherrod Brown  Claire McCaskill  Sheldon Whitehouse  and Amy Klobuchar  Harper s Magazine misrepresents Tammy Duckworth s position on Iraq  Harper s also implies that Duckworth is a pro war candidate  noting  When asked about her stand on the Iraq war by a reporter  Duckworth had replied   There is good and bad in everything     page 37 38  Duckworth  an Iraq war veteran  says on her website      Misleading Claim  4  Ethanol Harper s Magazine implies that Obama has supported ethanol production because the country s largest ethanol producer  ADM is based in Illinois  Harper s also argues that from a conservation standpoint it is potentially better to drive a standard gasoline car than a flex fuel vehicle   page 32   Fact  Senator Obama supports ethanol production because it is a clean  efficient  and domestically produced alternative to oil from the Middle East  According to the Environmental Protection Agency  E85 fuel produces fewer total toxins and lower levels of ozone forming volatile organic compounds compared to gasoline  The U S  Department of Agriculture has determined that ethanol production is efficient  creating 1 67 times the energy it takes to produce it   Argonne National Laboratory reports that by switching to ethanol and biomass fuels in our passenger cars and light duty trucks  drivers can potentially reduce the use of petroleum by at least 68 percent   Blending ethanol with gasoline just at a 10 percent level will translate to savings to consumers of  3 3 billion a year according to independent researchers at LECG  based on 2002 prices    Sources           Senator Obama wants to enable more entrepreneurs and small businesses to develop ethanol  Senator Obama supports a renewable fuels standard that would encourage ethanol production by expanding demand for renewable fuels and further diversifying the ethanol industry  thereby ensuring much greater competition in the U S  liquid fuels market in the future   Misleading Claim  5  Democratic Convention Speech Harper s Magazine suggests that Senator Obama was chosen to speak at the Democratic National Convention only after he had received the blessing of Washington lobbyists and fundraisers   If the speech was his debut to the wider American public  he had already undergone an equally successful but much quieter audition with Democratic Party leaders and fund raisers  without whose support he would surely never have had been chosen for such a prominent role at the convention    page 36  Fact  The decision to choose Senator Obama was made by Senator John Kerry s campaign  not by lobbyists  After Obama s selection as the keynote speaker at the 2004 Democratic National Convention  Senator Kerry s aides were very clear about their rationale  According to the Chicago Tribune   For the Kerry campaign  the choice of Obama has great meaning as officials try to dispel criticism that they have done a poor job of reaching out to African American voters  Kerry began to focus on Obama  the Democratic candidate for Senate in Illinois  for a role at the convention after meeting him for the first time and listening to him speak at a gala fundraiser in Chicago in April  The next day  Kerry and Obama toured the Greater West Town Community Development Project  visited a bakery  and held a town hall meeting together  An aide to Kerry said the Massachusetts senator was struck by Obama s  passion  eloquence and charisma    Chicago Tribune  July 15  2004   Misleading Claim  6  Private Jets Harper s Magazine wrongly says that Obama stopped taking privately subsidized air travel because of bad press    A fter some atypically bad press for accepting flight  Obama imposed a ban at his office on privately subsidized travel    page 40  footnote  Fact  Obama voluntarily chose to reimburse the full fare for private flights   not just the first class fare as Senate rules require   because he felt it was right  Obama voluntarily chose to reimburse full fare on private flights despite less stringent Senate rules because he thought it was the right thing to do   Obama s decision actually garnered Obama favorable press coverage   Senator Barack Obama flew at least nine times on corporate jets last year   each time  he reimbursed the plane s owners at first class rates  as Senate rules require  But Mr  Obama  freshman Democrat from Illinois  felt queasy about this perk of Senate life  so he said he gave it up   This is an example where appearances matter   he said    New York Times  March 8  2006   Misleading Claim  7  Organized Labor Harper s Magazine suggests that Obama s hiring of a former staffer for Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin makes him susceptible to policies that hurt organized labor  Harper s writes    Obama  hired Karen Kornbluh  a senior aide to Robert Rubin when the latter  as head of the Treasury Department under Bill Clinton  was a chief advocate for NAFTA and other free trade policies that decimated the nation s manufacturing sector    page 33  Fact  Obama has a strong pro labor voting record   Obama voted against the Central American Free Trade Agreement and has said that NAFTA should be renegotiated   Obama has cosponsored many important bills to help workers  including  an increase in the minimum wage  and the Employee Free Choice Act   He also championed efforts in the Senate to help air traffic controllers engaged in a labor dispute with the Federal Aviation Administration   Misleading Claim  8  Calling to Action Harper s Magazine criticizes Obama for calling on students only to strive for energy independence during a speech in July   Obama s speech contained just a single call for political action  This was when he had introduced Mark Pike  a law student who then came bounding across the state in a green one piece mechanic s outfit  As part of a campaign called  Kick the Oil Habit   Pike was to depart directly from the conference and drive from Washington to Los Angeles in a  flex fuel  vehicle   Give it up for Mark   Obama had urged the crowd  noting that Pike would be refueling only at gas stations that offer E85 which Obama touts as  a clean  renewable  and domestically produced alternative fuel     page 32  Fact  Obama was specifically asked to touch on only two themes in his speech  The group that organized the event   the Center for American Progress   specifically asked Obama to touch on two themes in his speech  1  what inspired him to go into politics  and 2  briefly the importance of energy independence    If Harper s was interested in hearing about other issues  below are speeches by Senator Obama on a range of subjects  which are all available on his U S  Senate website           Energy Security is National Security   Energy Independence and the Safety of Our Planet  Teaching Our Kids in a 21st Century Economy                                      ,1
372,   Sen  Obama and Sen  McCain Exchange Letters on Ethics Reform   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Sen  Obama and Sen  McCain Exchange Letters on Ethics Reform Monday  February  6  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Tommy Vietor   February 2  2006   The Honorable John McCain  United States Senate  241 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510   Dear John    Thank you for inviting me to participate in the meeting yesterday to discuss lobbying and ethics reform proposals currently before the Senate   I appreciate your willingness to reach out to me and several other Senate Democrats to discuss what should be done to restore public confidence in the way that Congress conducts its business   The discussion clearly underscored the difficult challenge facing Congress    You and many in the Democratic Caucus have played a major role in reform efforts in the Senate   In fact  the Indian Affairs Committee hearings you led were instrumental in promoting public awareness of the culture of corruption that has permeated the nation s capital    As you know  Senator Harry Reid and others in the Democratic Caucus have taken an important step by introducing   which imposes many of the same disclosure requirements for lobbyists that you have proposed  while also strengthening enforcement  eliminating  pay to play  schemes  and imposing more restrictive rules on meals  gifts  and travel that Members and their staff can receive from special interests that advocate before Congress   This bill  which now has the support of 40 members of the Democratic Caucus  represents a significant step in addressing many of the worst aspects of corruption that have come to light as a result of the Justice Department investigation of Jack Abramoff    I know you have expressed an interest in creating a task force to further study and discuss these matters  but I and others in the Democratic Caucus believe the more effective and timely course is to allow the committees of jurisdiction to roll up their sleeves and get to work on writing ethics and lobbying reform legislation that a majority of the Senate can support   Committee consideration of these matters through the normal course will ensure that these issues are discussed in a public forum and that those within Congress  as well as those on the outside  can express their views  ensuring a thorough review of this matter    Given the state of affairs in Washington  we have a historic opportunity to make fundamental changes in the way our government operates so that the actions we take as public officials are responsive and transparent to the American people   Thank you again for your interest in this important matter    Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator  February 6  2006   The Honorable Barack Obama  United States Senate  SH 713  Washington  DC 20510   Dear Senator Obama  I would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform legislation were sincere   When you approached me and insisted that despite your leadership s preference to use the issue to gain a political advantage in the 2006 elections  you were personally committed to achieving a result that would reflect credit on the entire Senate and offer the country a better example of political leadership  I concluded your professed concern for the institution and the public interest was genuine and admirable   Thank you for disabusing me of such notions with your letter to me dated February 2  2006  which explained your decision to withdraw from our bipartisan discussions   I m embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics I failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble   Again  sorry for the confusion  but please be assured I won t make the same mistake again    As you know  the Majority Leader has asked Chairman Collins to hold hearings and mark up a bill for floor consideration in early March   I fully support such timely action and I am confident that  together with Senator Lieberman  the Committee on Governmental Affairs will report out a meaningful  bipartisan bill       You commented in your letter about my  interest in creating a task force to further study  this issue  as if to suggest I support delaying the consideration of much needed reforms rather than allowing the committees of jurisdiction to hold hearings on the matter   Nothing could be further from the truth   The timely findings of a bipartisan working group could be very helpful to the committee in formulating legislation that will be reported to the full Senate   Since you are new to the Senate  you may not be aware of the fact that I have always supported fully the regular committee and legislative process in the Senate  and routinely urge Committee Chairmen to hold hearings on important issues   In fact  I urged Senator Collins to schedule a hearing upon the Senate s return in January    Furthermore  I have consistently maintained that any lobbying reform proposal be bipartisan   The bill Senators Joe Lieberman and Bill Nelson and I have introduced is evidence of that commitment as is my insistence that members of both parties be included in meetings to develop the legislation that will ultimately be considered on the Senate floor   As I explained in a recent letter to Senator Reid  and have publicly said many times  the American people do not see this as just a Republican problem or just a Democratic problem   They see it as yet another run of the mill Washington scandal  and they expect it will generate just another round of partisan gamesmanship and posturing   Senator Lieberman and I  and many other members of this body  hope to exceed the public s low expectations   We view this as an opportunity to bring transparency and accountability to the Congress  and  most importantly  to show the public that both parties will work together to address our failings     As I noted  I initially believed you shared that goal   But I understand how important the opportunity to lead your party s effort to exploit this issue must seem to a freshman Senator  and I hold no hard feelings over your earlier disingenuousness   Again  I have been around long enough to appreciate that in politics the public interest isn t always a priority for every one of us   Good luck to you  Senator    Sincerely    John McCain  United States Senate    February 6  2006   The Honorable John McCain  United States Senate  241 Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC  20510   Dear John    During my short time in the U S  Senate  one of the aspects about this institution that I have come to value most is the collegiality and the willingness to put aside partisan differences to work on issues that help the American people   It was in this spirit that I approached you to work on ethics reform  and it was in this spirit that I agreed to attend your bipartisan meeting last week   I appreciated then   and still do appreciate   your willingness to reach out to me and several other Democrats    For this reason  I am puzzled by your response to my recent letter   Last Wednesday morning  you called to invite me to your meeting that afternoon   I changed my schedule so I could attend the meeting   Afterwards  you thanked me several times for attending the meeting  and we left pledging to work together    As you will recall  I told everyone present at the meeting that my caucus insisted that the consideration of any ethics reform proposal go through the regular committee process   You didn t indicate any opposition to this position at the time  and I wrote the letter to reiterate this point  as well as the fact that I thought     I confess that I have no idea what has prompted your response   But let me assure you that I am not interested in typical partisan rhetoric or posturing   The fact that you have now questioned my sincerity and my desire to put aside politics for the public interest is regrettable but does not in any way diminish my deep respect for you nor my willingness to find a bipartisan solution to this problem       Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1
1716,"END THE WAR: SEN. SANDERS COSPONSORS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY END U.S. MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN IRAQ
  Sen. Bernie Sanders cosponsored legislation introduced this week that would effectively end U.S. military involvement in Iraq. The bill, introduced by Sen. Russ Feingold and supported by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, would require the president to begin safely redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq in 120 days. ""I strongly support the legislation to bring an end to U.S. involvement in the war in Iraq,"" Sanders said.  
   ""Since President Bush has refused to recognize the reality of the situation in Iraq,"" Sanders added, ""it is up to Congress to put and end to the war and bring our troops home. This legislation is an important step in that direction."" A key provision in the bill would stop all funding for the war, with three narrow exceptions, effective March 31, 2008. ""By setting a concrete timeline to stop funding for the war, this legislation sends a strong message to the president that he cannot simply continue to follow the same failed policies."" 
   Other cosponsors are Senators Patrick Leahy, Barbara Boxer, Chris Dodd, Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, and Sheldon Whitehouse.

  The No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 required states to improve public schools for all students in exchange for increased federal aid. Has the bargain been honored? Has it worked? With the law authorizing the program about to expire, should it be extended or should it be scrapped? If it is broken, can it be fixed? Those questions framed a town meeting on Tuesday hosted by Sen. Bernie Sanders. He brought together a group of Vermont at Burlington High School to discuss No Child Left Behind. Sanders is a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

  A federal judge in Vermont ruled today that Vermont and other states can regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. U.S. District Court Judge William Sessions III rejected automaker claims that federal law preempts state rules. 
   ""At a time of growing concern about air pollution and global warming, it is tragic that the American automobile industry made a federal case out of its wrongheaded attempt to avoid responsibility for helping to clean up the problem it created,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
   ""I hope this court ruling is upheld so states like Vermont and California can take the strong measures necessary to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Sanders added. ""The Bush administration must stop siding with polluters and at least get out of the way of states that want to help the environment.""
   Before the tough California standards can take effect, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must grant a waiver the state has sought under the federal Clean Air Act.

1981,"SENS. LEAHY, SANDERS, REP. WELCH SLAM BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR TARGETING MILC PROGRAM IN WHITE HOUSE'S NEW VETO THREAT TO FARM BILL
  The three members of the Vermont Congressional Delegation - Sen. Patrick Leahy (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) and Rep. Peter Welch (D) - are pushing back against a new Bush Administration veto threat against expansion of the MILC program, the basic safety net for dairy farmers when prices plummet. The Administration included its objections to expanding the MILC program in a new veto warning message lodged this week against the Senate's version of the Farm Bill. 
   The Senate began debating a new five-year Farm Bill this week and continues work on the bill next week. The Bush Administration's new ""Statement of Administration Policy"" (SAP) on the Senate's Farm Bill includes the following objections to the MILC program provisions in the Senate bill: ""The bill also increases the payment rate for the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program and increases the quantity of milk that is eligible to receive MILC payments. These increases likewise do not signify reform, result in more market distorting policy, and increase government costs."" 
   Leahy, the Senate Agriculture Committee member with the most seniority and a former chairman of the panel, authored and included the extension and expansion of the MILC program in the Senate's Farm Bill. Sanders and Welch have worked with Leahy in forging bipartisan Senate and House coalitions in support of extending the MILC program. The House-passed version of the Farm Bill includes an extension but not also an expansion of the MILC program.
   Sanders said, ""Once again, the White House is putting its far-right ideology ahead of the needs of the country. In this case, the President's irresponsible promised veto will hurt family farmers, hungry children, and the environment. While this Farm Bill is not everything that I would want, it makes needed improvements in our nutrition programs, extends and improves the MILC program that is so important to family dairy farmers, and it puts additional emphasis on conservation and renewable biofuels. Americans said very clearly last November that they want change. President Bush should honor the wishes of the American people and withdraw his veto threat. The Bush Administration seems to have no trouble finding money to pay for the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthy, but somehow there's just not enough money for hungry children.""
   Leahy said, ""The Bush Administration is not letting up in their assault on dairy farmers,"" said Leahy. ""They opposed our Dairy Compact, and they have dug in their heels about strengthening the MILC program. Dairy farmers are only a market cycle away from hard times that can drive them off the land and out of business. It is unconscionable that President Bush now wants to undercut the safety net that stands between dairy farmers and ruinous downturns in their hard-earned income.""
   Welch said, ""The President is once again demonstrating his reckless and out-of-touch priorities. We are working hard to assure fairer milk prices, cut commodity payments for wealthy Western farmers, support farm-to-school programs, and fund food stamps. President Bush is yet again a roadblock to progress.""
   The 2007 Senate Farm Bill would extend the MILC program for the life of the bill, 2008 to 2012, while expanding the program in two ways that are especially important to Vermont dairy producers. Leahy made this possible earlier this year by pushing through a funding baseline for an extension of the MILC program. The Senate Farm Bill would raise the payment percentage under the program, and it would expand program eligibility to fully cover about 90 percent of dairy farmers. The bill also includes a wide variety of other Vermont priorities, including more support for farmers who want to make the transition to organic production, added help for the cleanup of Lake Champlain through conservation assistance partnerships with farmers, and more resources for anti-hunger programs like the Vermont Food Bank.

1900,"SANDERS FIGHTS FOR VERMONT WORKERS
  The Department of Labor is investigating whether a company that employs workers who process citizenship applications in Vermont and California violated federal regulations by cutting their pay when a new contract with Stanley Associates begins Monday. Two hundred employees in Vermont, half the workforce, will have their earnings slashed, Sen. Bernie Sanders said in a letter last week to Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao. He asked for the investigation into whether the Virginia-based contractor is violating a federal law guaranteeing that federal contract workers receive prevailing wages and benefits. Ironically, these are the same workers the federal government is counting on to alleviate huge application backlogs. ""Not only is it wrong for the workers, it's wrong for what we're trying to do for homeland security,"" Sanders told WCAX-TV. ""These people are doing really important jobs. ""There's a great backlog in the kinds of cases they're dealing with. To tell them that at a time when we want to fight terrorism and protect America that oh, by the way, we're cutting your wages, we're going to demoralize you, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me."" 
   This process started with workers reaching out to Senator Sanders' office to express their concerns and frustration. Now they have their Senator on their side. If you too have a problem you think we should know about or can help with, please contact the Senator's office.

889,July 12  2007 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approves  200 000 for New Waterfront Development in Brewerton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Federal Funding Awarded for Revitalization and Redevelopment Project Along the Oneida Lake Waterfront   Senators Worked Closely with Committee to Include Funding in Spending Bill   Bill Will Now Be Sent to the Senate Floor                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies  TTHUD  FY08 Appropriations Bill  which includes  200 000 for the Hamlet of Brewertons Revitalization and Redevelopment project   The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process   Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this years spending bill    This is great news for the Hamlet of Brewerton and all of Onondaga County  Schumer said   Brewertons drive to re invigorate the Oneida Lake waterfront is one of the most exciting projects in the region  and will jumpstart economic development   These improvements will bring new business and jobs to the entire area and improve the quality of life for both residents and visitors from neighboring communities     I am thrilled that our Senate colleagues have approved these funds so we can get started on the revitalization and redevelopment of Brewerton   These funds will help facilitate improvements to sidewalks and public spaces  as well as the restoration of the Brewerton waterfront to a picturesque  vibrant place for everyone in the community to enjoy  Senator Clinton said   These aesthetic upgrades not only have the potential to create better public spaces for the community but to facility increased tourism and boost the local economy  while contributing to the already exceptional quality of life in the region    The Revitalization and Redevelopment of the Hamlet of Brewerton project will receive  200 000 of federal funds to revitalize and redevelop the Hamlet of Brewerton by upgrading the sidewalks  street lamps  and access areas   The Hamlet of Brewerton is located in the Town of Cicero   Brewerton encompasses approximately 3 2 square miles  with a substantial portion of the Hamlet fronting on the shores of Oneida Lake and the canal system   Brewerton will use these funds to revitalize and further develop the community   These funds will be the impetus for taking the long neglected area of the Brewerton waterfront and changing it to a thriving and bustling area   By doing so  significant new jobs would be created  property values would be greatly increased  and people in the northern suburbs of Onondaga County and southern suburbs of Oswego County would be able to enjoy a vibrant and exciting waterfront community     Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee  it will be sent to the Senate floor  Following approval by the Senate  the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature         ,0
272,   Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons Wednesday  July 19  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511 Date  July 19  2006  Bipartisan Coalition of Senators Introduce Legislation to Reduce Gasoline Consumption by Half a Trillion Gallons  13 1 Million Barrels of Oil  by 2028 Legislation Would Increase Fuel Economy Standards for First Time in 20 Years   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN  and Dick Durbin  D IL  today introduced legislation that would reduce U S  gasoline consumption by nearly half a trillion gallons by 2028 and greatly decrease our dependence on foreign oil    The true danger of America s dependence on foreign oil is best explained not by politicians or energy experts here in the United States  but by our enemies abroad   said Obama     Oil  is the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community   These are the words of Al Qaeda   Focus your operations on oil  especially in Iraq and the Gulf area  since this will cause them to die off  on their own    These are the words of Osama bin Laden  It is clear that the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on earth is the oil we import and cannot live without      Most of the world s oil is concentrated in places that are either hostile to American interests or vulnerable to political upheaval and terrorism   said Lugar  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   To the extent that we remain reliant on imported oil  we imperil our nation s economic health and our way of life      If it was not clear before  it is now  Domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Joseph R  Biden   For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks       Gas prices are skyrocketing but they re just the part of our problem   said Senator Gordon H  Smith  R OR    Importing so much oil leaves us vulnerable to some of the most unstable regimes in the world  Automakers have been too slow to change and we re risking damage to American security and the economy       The U S  passenger fleet alone accounts for 1 10th of world oil consumption   said Bingaman   With oil and gasoline prices where they are today  it s hard to imagine a genuine discussion of our country s energy future without a significant effort to improve vehicle fuel efficiency  This moderate proposal to begin raising the standards for fuel economy deserves a serious look from the Senate  There are many good ideas out there and a healthy debate to be had about the best ways to do this  I hope the introduction of this bipartisan bill can spur the Senate to have this long overdue discussion      This sound approach to reducing gasoline consumption will help ensure our vehicles utilize improved technology to stretch how far Americans can drive on a tank of gas   said Harkin   Our dependence on foreign oil not only hurts the budgets of American families  it threatens our economy and national security      Our reliance on foreign oil is not only an economic strain  but also a threat to our national security   said Coleman   It s time we take the decisions about our energy supply out of the hands of foreign nations  By coupling a sensible fuel efficiency standard that will push technology to the marketplace with strong tax incentives  we can put American in the fast lane to energy independence     For years now  automobile manufacturers have built bigger and less efficient vehicles  leaving consumers with poor choices in terms of fuel economy  Automakers have the technology to make SUVs and other vehicles get better gas mileage  but they have chosen not to do that    instead the largest SUVs have gotten bigger  heavier and more dangerous   said Durbin   It s time we fix the law and encourage both manufacturers and consumers to make smart choices for the future     America spends  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually  on its 20 million barrel a day oil habit  Passenger vehicles alone burn 8 million gallons of oil each day  Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue  With oil prices hovering near  75 a barrel and total U S  petroleum use estimated to increase 23 percent over the next 20 years  we must act now to prevent a future energy crisis  But while it s clear that increasing fuel economy standards is a crucial part of any effort to reduce our consumption of foreign oil  efforts to raise them have been stalled for 20 years   The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006 seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of 1 mile per gallon each year  The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved    This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised    In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year    If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  that means consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028    The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars    We need to act now if we want to prevent an even greater energy crisis in the future   said Obama   This bipartisan  common sense approach will finally harness the technology we already have to save Americans money at the pump and save America from a dependence on the world s most unstable  undemocratic regimes     The Fuel Economy Reform Act A New Approach to Increasing CAFE Standards   On Wednesday  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph Biden  D DE   Gordon Smith  R OR   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   and Dick Durbin  D IL  introduced the Fuel Economy Reform Act to break the legislative and administrative logjam that has prevented fuel economy standards from being raised for more than 20 years   A New Approach  The Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006 seeks to break the logjam on establishing greater vehicle fuel economy by establishing a target  rather than a mandate  of a 4 percent annualized increase in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards   a rate that the National Academy of Sciences has determined is possible   unless the experts at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  justify a deviation in that rate by proving that the increase is technologically unachievable  cannot maintain overall fleet safety  or is not cost effective when comparing with the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved   Higher Fuel Economy Standards  If the 4 percent per year target is met for ten years after the continuous provision improvements go into effect  this bill will save 1 3 million barrels of oil per day and 20 billion gallons of gasoline per year   If gasoline is just  2 50 per gallon  consumers will save  50 billion at the pump in 2018 alone  By 2028  Americans will have saved a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline and cut global warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases   Flexibility for Manufacturers  The Fuel Economy Reform Act also provides fairness and flexibility to domestic auto makers by establishing different standards for different types of cars   Currently manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars   This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large vehicles rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars   The bill creates further flexibility by giving NHTSA the authority to allow companies to earn credit for improving fuel efficiency beyond the CAFE standard in one type of car  and using those credits to meet goals for other vehicle models   Companies would be able to trade or sell excess credits  improving overall fuel standards in the most efficient way  Because technological advances may affect manufacturers over time  the bill instructs the Energy Department  Environmental Protection Agency  and National Academy of Sciences  to study ways to reform the regulatory structure of this approach in 2016   Incentives for Fuel Efficiency  In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop advanced technology vehicles  this legislation provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants   This will strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles   The bill would lift the current 60 000 per manufacturer cap on buyer tax credits to allow more Americans to buy ultra efficient vehicles    The Problem    America is Addicted to Foreign Oil  America s 20 million barrel a day habit costs our economy  800 million a day  or  300 billion annually   We use 8 million barrels of oil each day on passenger vehicles   Because we import 60 percent of our oil  much of it from the Middle East  our dependence on oil is also a national security issue   While oil currently hovers near  75 a barrel and  3 00 a gallon at the pump  over the next 20 years total US petroleum demand will increase 23 percent     CAFE Initial Success Followed by 20 Years of Little Progress  In response to the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s  Congress enacted CAFE standards  the first ever requirements for gas mileage  Under Congress  direction  the NHTSA raised the average gas mileage of cars and trucks from just over 14 miles per gallon  mpg  in 1976 to 27 5 mpg for cars and 20 7 mpg for trucks by 1985   By enacting these standards  the country saves approximately 3 million barrels of oil per day  making it the most successful energy saving measure ever adopted   Unfortunately  since 1985 the NHTSA has been largely unable to increase standards   The CAFE standard for cars has remained frozen at 27 5 mpg for 20 years   The standard for trucks only increased by 2 mpg to 22 2 mpg for 2007   Over those 20 years  the auto industry has developed numerous innovations  which allowed fuel efficiency standards to rise to 45 miles per gallon in Japan   Congressional Deadlock  Since 1985  Congress has considered numerous bills to increase fuel efficiency  without significant gains in CAFE standards   Recently  there has been a logjam between those who want Congress to mandate specific increases in CAFE standards  and those who want to cede the policy choice to NHTSA  even though the agency has been unable to inability to overcome institutional and political obstacles to increasing CAFE standards

1052,September 13  2006 Senator Clinton Announces New Proposal to Address 9 11 Health Effects

                       Underscores Need to Expand Monitoring and Treatment for First Responders  Volunteers  Residents and Others Click here for video of Senator Clinton s remarks on the Senate floor             Washington  DC    Emphasizing the need to expand medical and mental health monitoring and treatment of those whose health has been affected by 9 11  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today unveiled a new proposal to provide  1 9 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment grants  available from 2007 2011  to firefighters  police officers  EMTs  paramedics  building and construction trades workers  volunteers  residents  and others whose health was directly impacted at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills   This funding would be administered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and would expand access to health monitoring and health care to all of those who served  lived and worked in the area in the aftermath of 9 11   Senator Clinton announced her proposal in remarks on the floor of the Senate           I believe that we have a moral obligation as a nation to take care of those who took care of us  as a way of demonstrating our solidarity and commitment to them and honoring their resilience and courage in the face of the terrorist attacks   said Senator Clinton          Senator Clinton sounded the alarm soon after 9 11 that those exposed to the toxic air at and around Ground Zero would suffer health effects from their exposure and would need help in the days  months and years to come   She led efforts to secure  12 million in December 2001 to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program run by Mt  Sinai  the first program designed to track and monitor the health of 9 11 responders   Senator Clinton worked with her colleagues to secure an additional  90 million to expand the number of workers and volunteers eligible  and successfully helped to restore  125 million in additional funding for long term medical and mental health monitoring and treatment and workers compensation benefits          Senator Clinton emphasized that a report released this month by Mt  Sinai shows conclusively that thousands of first responders  workers  volunteers  residents and others suffered mental and medical health problems as a direct result of 9 11   Senator Clinton has underscored that this report confirms the need to expand access to health monitoring and treatment to cover all of those whose health was affected by 9 11            The following is the text of Senator Clinton s remarks on the Senate floor       Remarks by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Senate Floor on New Proposal to Address 9 11 Health Effects      This amendment goes to the heart of our obligations to one another with respect to homeland security   It arises out of the attacks of 9 11  the extraordinary physical damage that has been done to thousands and thousands of New Yorkers and other Americans because they responded to that disaster  because they worked in the area of Ground Zero  because they lived or volunteered there          Each of us is marked in our own way by the events of five years ago  I need not recount them  We have just gone through a very painful anniversary of those attacks  My hope is that we would not mark this fifth year anniversary merely by wreath layings and speeches and solemn readings of the names of the victims  but that it would serve as a reminder of our unfinished business and a call to action on behalf of the service and sacrifice of first responders  workers and volunteers who participated in the rescue and recovery at Ground Zero          I have worked the past five years to honor the memories of those who died  to take care of their families and to help rebuild New York   I have fought for the funding that has generously been offered by the American people to support the economic recovery of downtown New York  building new buildings  helping to support small businesses  creating new transportation infrastructure to replace that which was obliterated  And I have worked to secure funding  starting in the fall of 2001  to monitor those who were affected by the exposure to the toxic gases and substances in the air as a result of the attacks and the implosion of the buildings          I believe that we have a moral obligation as a nation to take care of those who both took care of us and who attempted to return to their ordinary lives as a way of demonstrating solidarity and commitment  resilience and courage in the face of the terrorist attacks          There s much we have to do  which is why we are debating this bill about port security  but there is so much more than port security   The Democrats offered a comprehensive amendment to this bill that contained the recommendations of many experts  including the 9 11 Commission  Sadly  it was unsuccessful  but that doesn t mean it wasn t merited and that we cannot rest until we have a comprehensive  well funded strategy to deal with the threats we face   But Mr  President  I rise today to talk about a very specific issue          The toll of that fateful day goes beyond the families and friends and colleagues  the brave responders who saved 25 000 people in the greatest rescue mission in the history of the world   Their lives will always stand in our memory and in honor   But thousands of others rushed into that burning inferno   Thousands of others were there when that enormous  devastating cloud of death and destruction covered much of Lower Manhattan  crossed the river to Brooklyn  crossed the river to New Jersey          We have been working to understand the health implications for the people who breathed that air  And that s why I ve fought to get money for a monitoring and screening program that was established both at the fire department to take care of our firefighters and also at one of our great hospitals  Mt  Sinai  to figure out what happened to everybody else          The work that commenced from the moment the first plane hit was hazardous and difficult  And for as long as nine months we had firefighters and police officers  trade and construction workers  other workers  volunteers  residents    we had probably at least 40 000 people coming and going and staying on that site  They worked and lived amidst the dust and the fog and the smog  a toxic mix of debris  smoke and chemicals          I first visited the site about 24 hours after the attacks  I was within blocks of the epicenter of the attack  and I could not see anything  but I could smell it  I could taste it  I could literally feel it  And as I watched that curtain of darkness part and the firefighters walking out covered in black soot  dragging their fire axes  barely able to stand after being on duty for probably 24 hours  I had the first inkling that the damaging effects of 9 11 would last far beyond the actual attack          Now unfortunately our government officials in charge of making sure health and working conditions did not negatively impact our first responders sent mixed signals at best  I would go further  They misled people  They said the air was safe  They made no effort to reach out and share the dangers that people knew were in this air   And it wasn t only people from New York who responded  It was people from all over the country          My colleague  Senator Voinovich from Ohio and I  have a bill that would set up a system for the president to carry out a program for the monitoring of the health and safety of first responders that are exposed to harmful substances as a result of the disaster rather than reacting on an ad hoc basis as we ve had to do in the wake of 9 11          Because of what I witnessed firsthand and what people started to tell me          You know  the trademark World Trade Center cough appeared within days  people had trouble breathing  had trouble swallowing  they were coughing  That s why I was so insistent upon getting  12 million to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program at Mt  Sinai   We quickly realized they would need a lot more work because thousands and thousands of people were signing up and coming   So we secured an additional  90 million  and we expanded the number of workers and volunteers  and that was in addition to what we did for the fire department  which ran its own program          Well  last week Mt  Sinai released a report that confirmed our worst fears   It confirmed an earlier report of the New York City fire department study   Tens of thousands of firefighters and all the others who were there were not only exposed but were suffering from significant medical and mental health problems   We are seeing young men and women in the prime of their lives who were in excellent physical health experiencing asthma  bronchitis  persistent sinus sites  laryngitis   They are suffering from serious diseases  reactive airway disease  their lungs are collapsing  their livers are polluted   In fact  we are now seeing the first deaths          It is not enough to say we stand with the brave men and women who responded when we needed them   We have to do more          We appropriated  125 million and after a year and a half of struggle  money that was meant to go for the workers  comp system because so many of these people cannot work anymore  they are on disability  they are forced into retirement  and so many of them  about 40  of them  were screened at Mt  Sinai had no insurance so they can t even get the treatment which they now know they need  We have met with the Secretary of Health and Human Services who has promised to get the money released to begin treating these brave men and women  We have worked with Dr  John Howard  the Director of NIOSH  who has documented so many of the diseases and chronic conditions that we ve seen  But we have a long way to go  and we need to start now          I can t give you an exact amount of money that it will take to take care of these thousands of people   But we know it will be a lot more than the  75 million we re waiting to be released on October 1  That s why this amendment would authorize  1 9 million in grants to begin the process of setting up the system  and over the next five years implementing a system to take care of thousands of people who are getting sick and who are dying          We had a bipartisan  bicameral hearing in New York City last week  One of the witnesses  Steve Centore  who was a federal employee  sat before us  his skin yellowed from the diseasing of his liver  his memory shot  his lungs collapsing and described in detail how his government has let him down and left him behind  If we don t take care of these people now and start putting up a system that we can have in place for the next several years  we are going to betray a fundamental responsibility to those whom we salute whenever it is convenient  whenever it is political   But enough with that   They don t want our speeches  They don t want our flowery rhetoric   They want our help          My amendment uses rough estimates of about  5 800 per individual per year to provide for the continuing monitoring  but more importantly  the treatment of these individuals  These are the rough estimates  the best we have right now from the fire department and Mt  Sinai  but we already know that there are people on lung transplant lists who were on that pile   We already know that people who have been disabled are unable to work and therefore have no insurance any longer   We know that there are those who have died because of these exposures          Now  did everybody get sick   No  Will everybody who got sick die          No   Much of it depends upon where you were  what you were exposed to  what the intensity and the length of the exposure was   Some of it also depends on your predisposition  your susceptibility  your genetic make up          But take the case of Detective James Zadroga  a 34 year old detective who joined the NYPD in 1992   He did not smoke  He had no known history of asthma   He was an exemplary NYPD detective  the kind of detective they make TV shows about   Someone with a shelf full of commendations who put himself in harms way time and time again to protect the people of the City of New York   Spend time with his father Joseph  a retired police chief   You ll hear about the 450 hours that this decorated detective spent working on recovery efforts on the pile at Ground Zero in 2001   Filled his lungs with fiberglass  with pulverized concrete  with other toxic chemicals that destroyed his lungs   The stress and strain of his deteriorating physical condition was followed by the death of his wife  leaving him responsible for his two year old daughter  He died on the floor of his bedroom with his little girl trying to wake him up          I know this is an authorization bill and I know that it doesn t appropriate money but it does something equally important  it sets a marker  It makes a statement  It takes all of the words and claims to concern and puts them into action  It says that we re not only with you in word and deed but we will not abandon you in your time of need          If as we hear September 11 was a day that changed our nation forever  and it s one that Americans will always remember  then let us not lose sight of its lessons  Let us finally heed the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission by fully implementing them   Let us do everything we can to make our bridges  our tunnels  our transit systems  our rail lines  our entire infrastructure as safe as possible   But otherwise we re going to have a lot of autopsy reports like we had for James Zadroga and we re going to read about the death and disability of thousands and thousands of our bravest  most courageous men and women           And we re going to see construction workers who before 9 11 could lift three times their body weight in steel and do whatever was necessary to construct those sky scrapers bent over in pain unable to breathe and sleep   I don t think that s what we want as our legacy as a nation coming out of 9 11          The country has been very supportive of New York  and I am extremely grateful  but we were on the end of the spear when it came to absorbing the attack and reacting  And now we have to continue to keep faith with those who did our country proud in the hours  days  weeks and months following that horrific attack on our nation          Mr  President  I would ask for the consideration of this amendment to honor those who honored us and to create a system to make sure that they do not go without care  that they get the treatment they need  that their life can be saved and prolonged  that we don t lose any more 34 year old detectives  who in the autopsy report  the pathologist said   it is felt with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the cause of death in this case was directly related to the 9 11 incident   Let s not have any more victims of the terrorists  Let s not let Bin Laden and Al Qaeda claim any more Americans who died as a result of their evil attack on us  Let s band together and support those who need us in their hour  And I hope  Mr  president  that we can make such a statement with this amendment today          ,0

1732,"SENATE ADOPTS SENS. SANDERS, CLINTON JOB-TRAINING PROPOSAL
  As debate began on a comprehensive energy bill, the Senate today adopted a job-training proposal by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. 
   The measure would authorize resources to train workers for ""green collar jobs"" that involve the design, manufacture, installation, operation, and maintenance of technologies associated with energy efficiency and renewable, clean energy options. It also would authorize research on labor market trends.  
   ""One way to slow global warming is to use energy in a smarter way. An effective and economical way to cut consumption is to make homes and businesses more energy efficient. Trouble is, today you would have a hard time finding workers qualified to do the job,"" Sanders said. ""If we're smart, we can help people make their homes and offices more energy efficient and in the process create millions of good-paying 'green jobs.' ""
   ""To attack global warming, we need to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy,"" said Senator Clinton. ""Deploying these technologies is a win-win that will reduce pollution and create new, good-paying jobs. This important legislation will help to train workers to meet the needs of the growing clean energy sectors of our economy.""
   The Senate adopted their amendment by a voice vote after Sanders told colleagues why the program is necessary. ""In Vermont,"" he said, ""if a family wants to weatherize their home, it can take up to two years to make it happen because there are not enough workers out there. The same thing goes for installation of solar panels or wind turbines. The widespread adoption of these technologies is being stopped in its tracks because we simply don't have enough people to do the jobs.""
   A study last year by the National Renewable Energy Lab identified the shortage of training as ""a leading non-technical barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth.""
   Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, Public Citizen, The Sierra Club, The Union of Concerned Scientists and other environmental groups backed the amendment. So did labor and business groups.
   The National Association of Energy Service Companies, American Solar Energy Society, American Wind Energy Association, Renewable Fuels Association, and Solar Energy Industries Association wrote that ""across the country, our companies experience workforce shortages as one of the key barriers to growth. By establishing a pilot program specifically geared toward the renewable energy and efficiency industries, the Sanders-Clinton Amendment would enable us to build the workforce our industries need to achieve their maximum potential.""
   The Apollo Alliance, a coalition of labor, environmental and other groups, as well as the AFL-CIO also supported the measure.
   ""As Congress advances programs to enhance our energy security and address global warming, workforce shortages are emerging in the utilities sector that could stymie growth of the renewable energy and efficiency industries,"" Apollo Alliance President Jerome Ringo said. ""According to the American Public Power Association, half of current utility workers will retire within the next decade. However, our nation is not training enough new workers to fill their places.""

                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Calls on IRS to Extend Tax Filing Deadline by Two More Weeks for Impacted Residents Listen to audio of Senator Clinton s comments   Washington  DC   In anticipation of a request for federal assistance from New York s Governor Spitzer  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to quickly provide the necessary aid and assistance to the areas that have been hit by the recent Nor easter storm as soon as it is formally requested by the Governor  In a letter to President Bush  Clinton asked that as soon as he receives the request for disaster assistance from Governor Spitzer  the White House expedite FEMA s assessment of the storm damage and issue a Presidential Disaster Declaration consistent with the Stafford Act as soon as possible            This storm has wreaked havoc on many communities  leaving many people and their homes and businesses severely damaged  Governor Spitzer has already toured some of the devastated areas  As soon as the Governor requests the necessary federal assistance  I hope the President will grant his request so that residents  business owners  farmers and other can get on with the job of recovering and rebuilding their lives   Senator Clinton said   I know that New York and local officials are already working together to collect damage information in the interest of building the strongest case for federal assistance and when they do  I hope the President will be willing to help           Senator Clinton today also called on Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Mark Everson to grant a further extension of at least two weeks for the tax filing deadline to the 1st of May to enable the residents to ensure their families  safety and assess their damages and losses without fear of missing the IRS deadline  The IRS has announced a special 48 hour extension of time to file tax returns granted to victims of the April 16 storm in the Northeast            I also hope the IRS will consider a longer extension of the filing deadline to enable impacted families to take care of their homes  property and welfare without fear of missing the tax filing deadline  I appreciate that the IRS has already granted a 48 hour extension but I think that many families will need even longer than that         A copy of Senator Clinton s letters to President Bush and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Everson are attached       The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President       I write in anticipation of a request from Governor Eliot Spitzer seeking an Presidential Disaster Declaration for those counties in New York that were severely impacted by the recent Nor easter storm that ravaged parts of the northeast and urge your quick approval            The storm has caused excessive damage to infrastructure and private property   According to press reports  in New York City  the National Weather Service said  52 inches of rain fell on Central Park on Monday and 7 57 inches on Sunday  a record for that date  In Westchester County  approximately 8 inches was recorded in White Plains  The area is not expected to dry out completely until Friday   Homes and businesses remained without power Tuesday morning and across parts of New York basements are flooded  houses are threatened due to erosion and businesses are water damaged   States of emergency have been declared in the Columbia  Greene  Rockland  Putnam and Westchester counties with Mamaroneck  New Rochelle  and Yonkers among the most severely affected   Rivers in Westchester and the Hudson Valley overflowed their banks   Long Island witnessed flooding in coastal communities  including Copiague  Amityville  Lindenhurst  Lake Ronkonkoma and Babylon  which also face the threat of more flooding with the coming high tide   On Fire Island  some homes were clinging to the shoreline after waves eroded the sand          To recover  residents will need necessary federal assistance to repair their homes and small businesses   I also assume that local governments  already stretched by structural financial shortfalls  will need further assistance to restore infrastructure and to assist their citizens          Upon the request from Governor Spitzer  I urge you to expedite the Federal Emergency Management Agency s  FEMA  assessment of the storm damage and issue a Presidential Disaster Declaration consistent with the Stafford Act as soon as possible I look forward to working with you to help the citizens of New York recover from this storm          I thank you for your immediate consideration   Please do not hesitate to contact me directly should you need additional information          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton        Dear Mr  Everson       As you know parts of New York State were hit by a severe storm this past weekend that has resulted in significant flooding  power outages  dangerous travel conditions and other hazards in the affected areas            I am aware that the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  has granted an extension of the tax filing deadline by two days beyond today s date   I certainly appreciate the IRS s consideration of the ability of taxpayers affected by the storm to file timely returns   However  given the extensive nature of the disruptions caused by the storms  I believe that a longer extension is warranted   Indeed  the relentless rainfall  snowfall and other dangerous weather conditions brought by the storm have precipitated evacuations in some areas  not to mention the hundreds of millions  if not billions of dollars in damages to homes  businesses and other property to those affected   In light of these circumstances  at least a two week extension of the tax filing deadline to the 1st of May would enable the residents of New York to ensure their families  safety and assess their damages and losses without fear of missing the IRS deadline           I request that you give all due consideration to this request and please keep in mind the harsh conditions being faced by thousands of New Yorkers   I believe that extension of the tax filing deadline is reasonable and would tremendously benefit the residents of New York affected by this storm  while causing minimal disruption to the IRS  duties and timetables           Thank you for your attention to this matter          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton              Click here for disaster assistance information    UPDATE  IRS Gives Northeast Storms Victims Until April 26 to File Tax Returns         ,0

1877,"WEEK IN REVIEW, OCT. 26
  Senator Bernie Sanders announced his opposition to President Bush's nominee for attorney general. Legislative action heated up on global warming. A Senate panel took a hard look at how American toymakers' run sweatshops in China. Community health centers got a big boost, and lawmakers renewed an effort to help lower prescription drug prices.  
   The Department of Justice Michael Mukasey's nomination to be attorney general ran into trouble. Sanders questioned his commitment to civil liberties. ""Of course the United States government must do everything that it can to protect the American people from the dangerous threat of terrorism,"" Sanders stressed, ""but we can do that effectively consistent with the Constitution and the civil liberties it guarantees. We need an attorney general who does not believe the president has unlimited power. We need an attorney general who understands that torture is not what this country is about, and we need an attorney general who clearly understands the separation of powers inherent in our Constitution,"" Sanders added. ""Unfortunately, it is clear that Mr. Mukasey is not that person"" By week's end, two top Senate Democrats said their votes on the Mukasey nomination will hinge on whether he will say on the record that an interrogation technique that simulates drowning is torture. ""It's fair to say my vote would depend on him answering that question,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy told reporters late Thursday. ""This to me is the seminal issue,"" said Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
   Global Warming A Senate panel on Wednesday took up global warming legislation. To Vermont's own Bill McKibben, it was about time. ""Long after the Nobel-winning reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, long after Hurricane Katrina, long after 'An Inconvenient Truth, they're finally taking up the single biggest question that the planet faces,"" wrote the Middlebury College visiting scholar and nationally-known environmentalist. Senator Bernie Sanders, the sponsor of the strongest legislation on climate change, is on the subcommittee that held the hearing and is set to vote on a compromise bill next Thursday. ""Let me be as blunt as I can be in telling you where I am coming from on this bill,"" he said. ""On most issues, Congress goes through the time-honored tradition of working out compromises which both sides can end up accepting?That's not the dynamic we face today. The issue today is one of physics and chemistry and what the best scientists in the world believe is happening to our planet because of greenhouse gas emissions."" A writer for the environmental publication Grist declared that Sanders' legislation on global warming is ""the strongest bill"" and ""the one basically every enviro would choose to implement if given the keys to the American political system for one day.""

  Chinese Sweatshops A Senate subcommittee on Thursday held a hearing on Sweatshop Conditions in the Chinese Toy Industry. Americans spent $22.3 billion on toys and sporting goods last year, and China accounted for 86 percent of U.S. toy imports, according to Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee. ""Many parents in America would be shocked and disturbed if they knew of the abusive sweatshop conditions under which their children's toys are being made in China,"" he testified. Senator Bernie Sanders is a cosponsor of the Decent Working Conditions and Fair Competition Act that would make it unlawful to sell, trade, or advertise sweatshop goods. American companies like Mattel have exploited cheap labor while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has lobbied the Chinese Communists to block humanitarian labor standards. ""The United States Chamber of Commerce is telling the authoritarian Chinese government that they are giving workers too many worker rights,"" railed Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders. ""Can you believe that?"" To watch Senator Sanders at the hearing, visit[http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=286099].
   Community Health Centers The Senate on Tuesday passed the largest increase in the history of the Community Health Center Program. Sanders, a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is a leading advocate for the program and fought for the $250 million increase in funding. ""In Vermont in recent years, we have expanded the number of health centers from two to six, and my hope is that we can add an additional three or four more centers in the next three years. These centers now serve over 86,000 Vermonters. They provide quality health care, quality dental care, low cost prescription drugs, and mental health counseling in some 23 different locations around the state of Vermont. The centers are the medical home for 24 percent of Vermont's Medicaid beneficiaries and serve 19 percent of our uninsured,"" said Sanders. The increased level of support the Senate approved would finance roughly 500 new or expanded health centers, serving an additional 2 million people nationally. More than 16 million Americans currently benefit from these health centers. For an average federal grant expenditure of $124 per patient, per year, the centers offer comprehensive medical, dental, and mental health services to all, regardless of their ability to pay. The Office of Management and Budget has cited the program as one of the most efficient in the use of taxpayer dollars. The health center funding was included in an appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.
  Prescription Drugs Legislation that would require the federal government to negotiate prices directly with pharmaceutical companies for medications under the Medicare prescription drug benefit was introduced on Tuesday, Congress Daily reported. According to a report released the same day by Consumers Union and the Medicare Rights Center, private insurers do not negotiate significant savings for Medicare beneficiaries. Senator Sanders has been fighting to lower prescription drug costs since he became the first member of Congress to take his constituents across the Canadian border to buy their medicine at a fraction of the price they were forced to pay in the United States. He has stood up to the drug industry's powerful lobby that spent more than 900 million dollars during the past decade trying to influence Congress to keep drug prices high. Earlier this month, he introduced legislation that would eliminate market exclusivity for new drugs, but give developers large cash rewards from a ""Medical Innovation Prize Fund"" when products improved health outcomes. By eliminating monopolies and allowing generic competition, prices on drugs would fall dramatically, saving taxpayers, employers and consumers more than $200 billion per year.

1904,"THE ECONOMY - 'ROBUST' OR IN RECESSION?
  More than two-thirds of Americans believe the U.S. economy is either in recession now or will be in the next year, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey published Thursday. The American people know what President Bush does not. That is why the president needs a White House budget director who will make him face the facts, not fan his fantasies.  
   Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, on Thursday voted against the confirmation of former Rep. Jim Nussle to be the White House budget director. Sanders also placed a hold on the nomination. 
   President Bush is completely out of touch with the economic realities facing working families in America. He needs to hear the truth, not an echo,"" Sanders said. 
   ""While the president tells us how wonderful and 'robust' the economy is, the American people, through the reality of their lives, understand how wrong the president is,"" added Sanders, citing the Wall Street Journal poll. 
   Since the president took office, Sanders said, 5.4 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty; nearly seven million Americans have lost their health insurance; median household income has gone down by nearly $1,300; three million manufacturing jobs have been lost; the real earnings of college graduates have gone down by about 5 percent; entry level wages for male and female high school graduates have fallen by 3.3 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively; and three million American workers have lost their pensions. 
   Moreover, Sanders pointed out, home foreclosures are now the highest on record; the personal savings rate is lower than at any time since before the Great Depression; wages and salaries are at the lowest share of gross domestic product since 1929; and the top 300,000 Americans now earn nearly as much income as the bottom 150 million Americans combined. 
   ""The president's budget proposals to Congress have been disastrous for the middle class and working people while providing hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires,"" Sanders said. ""I am sick and tired of the president telling us how great the economy is when every working American knows that is not true."" 
   Nussle and Sanders were colleagues in the House of Representatives. ""I know Jim Nussle. I like him. He is smart,"" said Sanders. ""He just doesn't get the economic realities facing working people in our country. ""Sadly, when Nussle was chairman of the House Budget Committee, his budget resolutions were even worse than what the president submitted. I cannot, in good conscience, vote for this nominee,"" Sanders concluded.

Suspicious Katrina Contracts Highlight Need for CFO Oversight   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  today issued the following statement in the wake of reports of waste  mismanagement and fraud in the handling Hurricane Katrina rebuilding effort    Just a few weeks into the most expensive rebuilding effort of all time  we re already hearing reports of overcharges  underperformance  and mismanagement   said Obama and Coburn    Finding out after the fact that we re spending taxpayer money on no bid contracts and sweetheart deals for cruise lines is no way to run a recovery effort   We re already seeing examples that highlight the need for an independent CFO who will be in charge of every penny that goes out the door  The American public and the people of the Gulf Coast deserve no less       The Senate Federal Financial Management Subcommittee s investigation into a six month  192 million FEMA contract with Carnival Cruise Lines has discovered that taxpayers are paying  per evacuee  four times the amount a vacation cruise passenger would have to pay   Three Carnival ships are only half full and mostly occupied by relief workers   Carnival s overhead costs in the FEMA operation are far lower than during normal cruises   The Carnival ships are docked   No fuel is being used and no entertainment is being provided to the relief workers   Yet  taxpayers are paying  2 550 per guest per week  which is four times the cost of a  599 per person  7 Day Western Caribbean  Cruise from Galveston  TX   When the federal government would actually save millions of dollars by forgoing the status quo and actually sending evacuees on a luxurious six month cruise it is time to rethink how we are conducting oversight   A short term temporary solution has turned into a long term  grossly overpriced sweetheart deal for a cruise line   Obama and Coburn said    The Coburn Obama bill would create a Chief Financial Officer  CFO  to oversee all expenditures associated with the Hurricane Katrina relief and reconstruction effort  The Hurricane Katrina CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  staffed with experts from relevant federal agencies  and would have management and oversight over any agency using federal funds for the recovery  The CFO would issue monthly financial reports to Congress  and the Government Accountability Office would issue quarterly reports to Congress reviewing the work of the CFO and recovery activities    Richard Skinner  the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security said that FEMA officials awarding contracts  took a lot of shortcuts that may have resulted in a lot of waste    said Obama and Coburn   We should appoint a CFO immediately to ensure that rebuilding and reconstruction money gets to the people who need it the most   SUMMARY OF COBURN OBAMA  OVERSEE ACT   A Chief Financial Officer  CFO  would be established and would be responsible for the efficient and effective use of federal funds in all activities relating to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina   Unlike an IG which audits money after it has been spent  the CFO would review expenditures before they are approved  This is a better way to protect against waste  fraud  and abuse   The CFO would be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate  and located in the Executive Office of the President   The CFO office would be staffed with experts detailed from relevant federal agencies  would have management and oversight of each federal agency involved in the recovery effort  and would work in conjunction with the inspectors general in each of these agencies and the president   Every month  the CFO would issue financial reports to Congress on the use of federal funds  These reports would include information about the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to persons most in need  the extent to which federal funds have been distributed to companies that hire local workers  and the use of no bid and  cost plus  contracts   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  would issue quarterly reports reviewing the activities and expenses approved by the CFO  These reports would examine the accuracy of the CFO s reports and include information on the use of no bid or  cost plus  contracts  whether federal funds have been used for their intended purposes  and the extent to which federal funds have helped persons most in need and local workers                                     ,1

                   Without a Fix From Congress  AMT Could Impact Up To 2 9 million New Yorkers in the 2006 Tax Year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    As millions of working families across America file their tax returns  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on Senate leaders to protect middle income families from the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT   which could hit up to 2 9 million New Yorkers in the 2006 tax year  In a letter to Senator Charles Grassley  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance  Senator Clinton urged him to support a Senate backed temporary fix to reduce the impact of the AMT in the Tax Reconciliation bill currently under negotiation between the House and the Senate             New York already has the second highest percentage of AMT taxpayers in the country and without an adjustment  millions of middle class households will see their tax burdens suddenly increase     Senator Clinton said    If nothing is done to fix this situation  nearly 2 9 million hard working New Yorkers will be hit by the AMT in the 2006 tax year  While there is no doubt that we need to look at a long term  fiscally responsible approach to fixing the AMT  we cannot place this kind of sudden  added burden on middle income taxpayers             Senator Clinton believes that it should be Congress  s top tax priority to address the AMT for the middle class  Over the last several years  she has supported the   hold harmless    fixes to ensure that more middle income households are not affected by the AMT          While both the House and Senate versions of the Tax Reconciliation bill contained temporary fixes to the AMT situation  in her letter to Senator Grassley  Senator Clinton said she believed that  though not perfect  the Senate  s version better reflects the priorities of working families and should be mirrored in the final version of the bill currently under negotiation by the House and Senate Conference Committee          Read Senator Clinton  s letter below            April 17  2006         The Honorable Charles Grassley  Chairman  United States Senate Committee on Finance  135 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  D C  20510      Dear Chairman Grassley           As you continue the negotiations on the Tax Reconciliation bill  I would like to reiterate my strong support for the inclusion of a true   hold harmless    Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  fix in whatever bill is reported out of the conference committee            The AMT relief provision included in the Senate passed tax bill  which I supported  would ensure that as few families as possible lapsed into AMT liability   I am concerned that the AMT provision being proposed by the House conferees would leave as many as 600 000 more families exposed to the AMT for the 2006 tax year   I would urge you to continue to reject that provision and insist on the AMT relief that passed the Senate   As you know  the AMT is a growing problem for many working families throughout the United States   In my state of New York as many as 2 9 million households for the 2006 tax year will be subject to the AMT if nothing is done to fix it now   We should take every action to prevent this stealth tax from hitting middle class families in New York and throughout the country   Therefore  I believe that AMT relief should be Congress   top tax priority           Clearly  AMT relief is a higher priority than the extension of the capital gains and dividend tax cuts  which are not scheduled to expire until the beginning of 2009   In fact  the Senate was able to achieve a bipartisan consensus when it rejected the inclusion of the capital gains and dividend tax cut extensions in its tax bill and included a strong AMT relief provision  the extension of the college tuition tax deduction  the extension of the research and development tax credit and increased IRA contributions among other important provisions   The Senate tax bill  while not perfect  reflected the priorities of working families and the final bill should be similar in its priorities           While I hope to work with you on addressing a long term solution to the AMT problem  I would hope that as we move forward  with an ever watchful eye on the deficit and exploding debt  that we use our resources as prudently and practically as possible   This would mean  addressing the AMT relief provisions first  and leaving further capital gains and dividend tax cuts out of this tax bill                      Thank you for your attention to these issues           Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0

1949,"SEN. SANDERS CALLS FOR FULL FUNDING TO TREAT VETERANS SUFFERING FROM TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES
  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) today called for full funding to treat veterans returning from combat with traumatic brain injuries. Of the more than 23,000 troops who have been wounded in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, two thirds have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. In fact, some estimates show as many as 10 percent of the troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered from brain injuries, with many going undiagnosed and untreated. Sanders was joined at today's Burlington press conference by Gary DeGasta, head of the Veterans Administration Medical Center in White River Junction, and Trevor Squirrell, executive director of the Brain Injury Association of Vermont. 
   Sanders said, ""With thousands and thousands of U.S. Service members returning home with traumatic brain injuries, it is critical that the VA has the resources it needs to treat and care for our troops. Unfortunately, for the second year in a row, President Bush has proposed eliminating funding for the Traumatic Brain Injury program.""
   Despite the president's lack of action, this Congress has forged ahead to address this important issue. This past week, Sanders, along with the majority of members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, recommended that the Budget Committee include billions more than the President's request in next year's budget for veterans' care. Included in the proposal was an increase in funding to treat traumatic brain injuries in the amount of $303.4 million.
   Sanders said, ""As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee and the Budget Committee I am pushing to make sure that Congress approves this additional funding for traumatic brain injuries and for other critical veterans' health care needs. The brave men and women who have served this country deserve no less than the best care available.""

487,   Obama Opposes Effort to Keep U S  Troops in Iraq Indefinitely   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Opposes Effort to Keep U S  Troops in Iraq Indefinitely Tuesday  March 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Announces his opposition to amendment removing redeployment dates from supplemental  WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today released the following statement on an amendment that would remove the deadlines for redeploying U S  troops from Iraq from the supplemental appropriations bill   Obama is the sponsor of the Iraq De escalation Act  which sets March 31  2008 as the target date for redeploying U S  combat brigades from Iraq  the same target date as a provision in the supplemental   Senator Obama   s statement  submitted for the record  is below    We gather on another occasion to bring the Iraq War to its fateful end   While this effort may fall short again  we will continue to try to do what is in the national security of our country   The Iraq War should never have been authorized   I was proud to say so in 2002  but I am even more proud of the plan I have offered that calls for combat to begin redeploying on May 1st with the goal of all combat troops out of Iraq by March 2008   We also must make sure that we   re not as careless getting out of this war as we were getting in  and that   s why this withdrawal should be gradual  and keep some U S  troops in the region to prevent a wider war in the region and go after Al Qaeda and other terrorists   Those who would have us continue this war in perpetuity like to say that this is a matter of resolve on behalf of the American people   But the American people have been extraordinarily resolved   They have seen their sons and daughters killed or wounded on the streets of Fallujah  They have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on this effort     money that could have been devoted to strengthening our homeland security and our competitive standing as a nation   No  it has not been a failure of resolve that has led us to this chaos  but a failure of strategy     a strategy that has only strengthened Iran   s strategic position  increased threats posed by terrorist organizations  reduced U S  credibility and influence around the world  and placed Israel and other nations friendly to the United States in the region in greater peril   Iraq has been a failure of strategy and that strategy must change   It is time to bring a responsible end to this conflict because there is no military solution to this war   Before we send our best off to battle in the future  we must remember what led us to this day and learn from the principles that follow   We must remember that ideology is not a foreign policy   We must not embark on war based on untested theories  political agendas or wishful thinking that have little basis in fact or reality   We must focus our efforts on the threats we know exist  and we must evaluate those threats with sound intelligence that is never manipulated for political reasons again   We must remember that the cost of going it alone is immense   It is a choice we sometimes have to make  but one that must be made rarely and always reluctantly   We must remember that planning for peace is just as critical as planning for war   Iraq was not just a failure of conception  but a failure of execution  and so when a conflict does arise that requires our involvement  we must try to understand that country   s history  its politics  its ethnic and religious divisions before our troops ever set foot on its soil   We must understand that setting up ballot boxes does automatically create a democracy   Real freedom and real stability come from doing the hard work of helping to build a strong police force  and a legitimate government  and ensuring that people have food  and water  and electricity  and basic services   And we must be honest about how much of that we can do ourselves and how much must come from the people themselves  And finally  we must remember that when we send our servicemen and women to war  we make sure we   ve given them the training they need  and the equipment that will keep them safe  and a mission they can accomplish   And when our troops come home  it is our most solemn responsibility to make sure they come home to the services  and the benefits  and the care they deserve  The cause to defend our country and our interests around the world will never end   It will be one of country   s constant threads through the ages  It is our sacred trust to ensure that those moments  those times of great struggle  are the right ones   And when they are not  we must continue to try and end those conflicts for the sake of our country our service men and women and the ideals we hold dear   For these reasons  I strongly support the provision in the supplemental bill that calls for the withdrawal of American combat troops by March 31  2008  and I will oppose any efforts to strip that provision from the bill                                   ,1
1262,February 16  2006 Senator Clinton Urges EPA Chief to Rethink Federal Cuts to Funding For Long Island Sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    At a hearing of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works yesterday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton urged the head of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Stephen L  Johnson  to reconsider the massive funding cuts in the President  s Budget that will impact the Long Island Sound  The Budget included cuts to funding for the EPA  s Long Island Sound program and the National Estuaries Program and completely eliminated funds for the Long Island Sound Restoration Act          The Long Island Sound is a vital commercial and recreational resource for New York and yet this budget leaves New Yorkers virtually on their own to clean up and maintain this precious but vulnerable asset     Senator Clinton said    I was pleased to be able to make this case to Administrator Johnson  The Administration must hear how devastating these budget cuts will be and I hope that Administrator Johnson understands their potential impact  I will fight to restore these funds in Congress           The President  s budget cuts the EPA  s Long Island Sound program from  1 8 million to less than  470 000  jeopardizing the Agency  s ability to implement the Comprehensive Cleanup and Management Plan  CCMP  that has been developed for the Sound         While the Budget includes  1 7 million for the Corps of Engineers to begin work on a long term management plan for the environmentally sound disposal of material dredged from the harbors around the Long Island Sound  it completely eliminates funding for the Long Island Sound Restoration Act  which Congress funded at nearly  4 million last year   This important Act  which Senator Clinton fought to have reauthorized for five years  provides funding for projects to protect the water quality of the Sound  including nitrogen reduction projects  and upgrades to wastewater treatment plants         In addition  the EPA  s National Estuaries Program is cut by  5 3 million  further threatening the clean up of the Sound and the 27 other nationally important estuaries  including the Peconic Estuary             ,0

839,September 11  2007 Senator Clinton Questions General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker on Iraq at Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Senator Clinton  I want to thank both of you  General Petraeus  Ambassador Crocker  for your long and distinguished service to our nation  Nobody believes that your jobs or the jobs of the thousands of American forces and civilian personnel in Iraq are anything but incredibly difficult    But today you are testifying about the current status of our policy in Iraq and the prospects of that policy  It is a policy that you have been ordered to implement by the president  And you have been made the de facto spokesmen for what many of us believe to be a failed policy     Despite what I view as your rather extraordinary efforts in your testimony both yesterday and today  I think that the reports that you provide to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief     In any of the metrics that have been referenced in your many hours of testimony  any fair reading of the advantages and disadvantages accruing post surge  in my view  end up on the downside    I started my morning today at ground zero  where once again the names of the nearly 3 000 victims of the attack on our country were read solemnly in the rain     We have seen Osama bin Laden reappear on our television sets  essentially taunting us  We have the most recent reports out of Germany of terrorists plotting against American assets who have been trained in Pakistan  And we get very little comfort from the fact that the mastermind of that mass murder is at large  neither captured nor killed  and that the Taliban and Al Qaida are resurging in Afghanistan and their network is certainly  if not tightly organized  a loose confederacy that has grave consequences for us            With respect to Anbar province  a lot has been made of the coalition s work with the sheiks  but that was going on before the surge     General  in your testimony during your confirmation hearings you referenced the fact that the sheiks were coming over  that there was already a decision by a lot of the tribal leaders that they would no longer tolerate the extraordinary brutality of the Al Qaida elements in Al Anbar province     With respect to violence within Iraq  although the charts tell part of the story  I don t think they tell the whole story  If you look at all of the evidence that s been presented  overall civilian deaths have risen  The number of car bombings is higher  May was the deadliest month in 2007 with 1 901 civilian deaths    American military casualties are greater every month in 2007 than in the same month in 2006  leaving us with a total thus far  through August  of 739 Americans killed     The Iraqi reconciliation process is now described as relying upon bottoms up efforts  which are anecdotal  which have very little hard evidence to support what needs to be accomplished     Senator Warner s very specific questions about what is happening from top down certainly lead to the conclusion that not very much is occurring that can give us comfort that the Iraqi leadership is yet ready to put aside their sectarian  commercial and personal interests for some kind of greater Iraqi political reconciliation     Iraqi public opinion  according to an ABC  BBC  NHK poll released September 10th shows that since the escalation began  Iraqi opinion has starkly turned against the U S  occupation  as most Iraqis see deepening dissatisfaction with conditions in Iraq  lower ratings for the national government  growing rejection of the U S  role there     For example  65 percent to 70 percent of Iraqis say the escalation has worsened rather than improved security  39 percent say that their lives are going well  down from 71 percent in November 2005  and 47 percent now favor immediate withdrawal of U S  forces  a 12 point rise since March     Overwhelming majorities give negative ratings to electricity  jobs and access to health care     So I give you tremendous credit for presenting as positive a view of a rather grim reality  And I believe that you  and certainly the very capable people working with both of you  were dealt a very hard hand     And it s a hand that is unlikely to improve  in my view     General  I want to ask you what    about what appeared to be a contradiction in your testimony  Earlier today  you were asked by Senator Biden if  in fact  the circumstances on the ground are exactly what they are today in March of next year  will you recommend the continuation of somewhere between 130 000 and 160 000 American troops being shot at  killed  and maimed every day     Your answer  I would be very hard pressed to recommend that at that point in time     In response to Senator Collins  who asked  I thought  a very important question about what if in a year from now  there has been very little progress  your answer was  Well  we would have to consider what to do at that time     General  don t you think the American people deserve a very specific answer about what is expected from our country in the face of the failure of the Iraqi government to pursue its own required political agenda that they have essentially been unwilling or incapable of doing so            General Petraeus  Senator  I don t see quite as big a difference in the answer     But  I mean  I will stand by the answer that I gave earlier  which is that I would be very hard pressed  at that time  to recommend a continuation     As you know  this policy is a national policy that results from policies put forward at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue  with the advice and consent and resources provided at the other  And I would  obviously  provide recommendations to that     And again  I would just say  I would be very hard pressed at that time  It s an awfully big hypothetical  And it is not something that I would want to try to determine right here  right now  about a point a year from now  without some sense of all the other variables that  I think  understandably  would go into a huge recommendation like that    Senator Clinton  Ambassador  it s not only the Iraqi government that  in my view  has failed to pursue a coherent strategy  I think our own has as well     You ve been tasked  as I understand it  with carrying the only contact with the Iranians and others in the region  And many of us have long advocated that our government needed to be much more engaged in a robust diplomatic effort     Do you believe that  if the full force and effect of the American government were brought to bear on the region and  more broadly  on countries that have a stake in the future of Iraq  even beyond the region  that there were some process established that could begin to try to sort out what was or wasn t possible  that that would be an additional benefit to your efforts  going forward in Iraq    Ambassador Crocker  Senator  engaging the region and the international community more broadly in support of Iraq is important  And that is ongoing and it s accelerating    This fall  we ll have at least two ministerial level meetings on Iraq  the one that I mentioned involving the neighbors  plus the P 5 and the G 8 in Istanbul    And then  in a little less than two weeks in New York  the secretary general of the U N  and Prime Minister Maliki will jointly chair an international ministerial level meeting to review progress on the International Compact with Iraq and also to focus on how the new United Nations mandate for Iraq    the expanded mandate for Iraq can most effectively be implemented     So I think we re seeing an increase in regional and international diplomacy in support of Iraq  We re also starting to see  I think  some change in attitudes  I talked a little bit earlier about some positive developments among some of Iraq s Arab neighbors  I think we re also seeing a new look at Iraq on the part of  at least  some of the European states     During a 10 day period  for example  at the end of August  we had the visits of Bernard Kouchner  the foreign minister of France  and then right after that  Carl Bildt  the foreign minister of Sweden    the first time  really  since 2003  we have seen major European states kind of send their foreign ministers into Iraq to kind of assess where Iraq is and how they can perhaps more effectively engage for the future     So I think we re seeing that kind of diplomatic initiative now gain some further momentum

1978,"IRAQ WAR DEBATE RESUMES IN SENATE
  The Iraq War debate resumed in the Senate on Monday with the defense authorization bill the new focus of a growing movement to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq. Significantly, several senior Republicans, including Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the former Foreign Relations Committee chairman, in recent days have openly broken with Bush on the war. ""There is a real possibility that there will be a day when Republican senators march to the White House and say to the president that it is time to end the war, an on that day the war ends,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders said to cheers at a town meeting on Sunday in Montpelier.  
   Republican senators earlier this year threw up parliamentary roadblocks to efforts by Sanders and others to set a timeline for withdrawal from Iraq. But on Sunday news programs, their disenchantment was clear. Lugar said on Late Edition on CNN that most U.S. forces should be pulled out of Iraq by no later than mid-2008 ""and probably before that time."" Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press, Senator Chuck Hagel said, ""We have no good options in Iraq now.""
   It remained unclear precisely how the rhetoric would translate into reality when roll call votes are cast on the Senate floor on amendments to the $648.8 billion defense measure. The bill would, for the first time, authorize funding for the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the Pentagon's regular activities for the fiscal year that begins October 1. Previously, Bush resorted to emergency spending bills to bankroll his war.
   Sanders is a cosponsor of two amendments to the defense bill. One of the first expected to come up for a vote is by Senator Jim Webb, a former Navy secretary. It would impose new troop-readiness requirements. Active duty soldiers could not be sent back into combat until they had been home for as long as their previous deployment. Now, soldiers may be deployed for fifteen months after twelve at home. Another amendment by Senator Russell Feingold would set a timeline for beginning the redeployment of troops out of Iraq within four months and require completing the withdrawal by no later than March 31, 2008. The Senate this week also may take up an amendment to effectively rescind the resolution that Congress passed in 2002 (over Sanders' opposition) authorizing the use of force in Iraq. That amendment by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Robert C. Byrd calls for the original war resolution to expire on October 11, 2007, the fifth anniversary of when Congress gave Bush the green light to invade Iraq.

Volunteers  and Others Whose Health Has Been Impacted                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Continuing their fight to secure adequate funds to assist with the treatment and monitoring of the firefighters  police officers  paramedics  first responders  building and construction trades workers  students  residents  volunteers  and others whose health is suffering because of the September 11th attacks in New York  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  and Edward M  Kennedy called on the President to include funds in his upcoming Fiscal Year 2008 Budget  The President  s Budget is due to be released in February          In a letter to the President today  the Senators also asked that the Department of Health and Human Services be prepared to provide funding for any gap between funding currently flowing to existing programs for medical and mental health monitoring and treatment until such time as Congress passes legislation to address the long term needs  The Senators have introduced legislation called the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006 and will reintroduce legislation next year when the 110th Congress convenes calling for  1 9 billion in funding to address these ongoing needs          A five year study conducted by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Ground Zero first responders found that almost 70 percent of WTC responders had new or substantially worsened respiratory symptoms following their work at the WTC site   Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9 11  61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC site  Studies published by the New York City Fire Department  FDNY  also show that over 90  of FDNY rescue workers had new respiratory symptoms following their work at WTC  over 30  continue to have respiratory and or mental health symptomatology  the average decrease in pulmonary function in the first year after WTC was 372ml  12 times the annual decline in the five years pre WTC   25  of those tested who were present during the morning of the attack have objective evidence for airway hyper reactivity consistent with asthma  and nearly 700  5  of exposed workforce  have qualified for respiratory disability pensions            These are alarming statistics and it is because of the severity of the problem that we want your Administration  s full commitment to ensure that our nation will not abandon those who responded in our time of need or who were victims of the attacks     the Senators said in their letter    Therefore  we ask that you and your Administration pledge full cooperation and support to find a solution to this problem by including funds in next year  s budget and to work with Congress on legislation           A copy of the Senators   letter follows       December 1  2006  The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States of America  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC 20500      Dear Mr  President       In anticipation of the 2008 budget we write to ensure that you make a significant commitment to the men and women who risked their lives and health in responding to the attacks of September 11  2001   It is clear that many different people were exposed to toxins at Ground Zero  Fresh Kills  and in the surrounding areas as a result of the collapse of the Twin Towers   Now  many are feeling the impact of that exposure through medical and mental health problems and our nation must provide a mechanism to treat these individuals now and into the future                      Funding for medical monitoring and treatment has been inadequate to date   As you know  Congress restored funding that was to be eliminated by last year  s budget to provide some initial funding for medical treatment and for ongoing monitoring   We have met with Secretary of Health and Human Services Leavitt and he assured us that HHS is working to find a solution to this problem and to get a handle on the true population suffering from exposure to toxins and other pulverized material which has directly impacted individual lung capacity   From our initial investigation  we know that police officers  firefighters  paramedics  first responders  building and construction trades workers  students  residents  volunteers  and others represent those individuals suffering because of the attacks   Unfortunately  their suffering is likely to worsen and their ability to do their work is threatened                      A five year study conducted by Mount Sinai Medical Center of Ground Zero first responders confirmed suspicions about the effects of having worked at the World Trade Center  WTC  site   According to the findings  almost 70 percent of WTC responders had new or substantially worsened respiratory symptoms following their work at the WTC site   Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9 11  61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC site                      Reports published by the New York City Fire Department  FDNY  show that over 90  of FDNY rescue workers had new respiratory symptoms following their work at WTC  over 30  continue to have respiratory and or mental health symptomatology  the average decrease in pulmonary function in the first year after WTC was 372ml  12 times the annual decline in the five years pre WTC   25  of those tested who were present during the morning of the attack have objective evidence for airway hyper reactivity consistent with asthma  and nearly 700  5  of exposed workforce  have qualified for respiratory disability pensions                      These are alarming statistics and it is because of the severity of the problem that we want your Administration  s full commitment to ensure that our nation will not abandon those who responded in our time of need or who were victims of the attacks   People from all across the United States came to assist New York and we know that some of those Americans were likely exposed as well   We are grateful for the work of Dr  John Howard of NIOSH who has been instrumental in helping Congress ascertain the true extent of this health crisis   However  it is clear from our initial understanding of the problem that significant  dedicated funding is needed in the short and long term                      We have introduced legislation called the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006 and will reintroduce that legislation next year when the 110th Congress convenes   This bill would provide  1 9 billion in grants for ongoing medical and mental health treatment and monitoring   In addition  the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee plans to hold hearings on this problem  and we will work with our colleagues to move this or other legislation through the Committee to address the problem                        Therefore  we ask that you and your Administration pledge full cooperation and support to find a solution to this problem by including funds in next year  s budget and to work with Congress on legislation   Further  we ask that the Department of Health and Human Services be prepared to provide funding for any gap between funding currently flowing to existing programs for medical monitoring and treatment until such time as Congress passes legislation that you can sign to address the long term needs                      We thank you for your attention to this matter and look forward to working with you          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles E  Schumer                                                            Edward M  Kennedy    Cc              Joshua

                  At a Meeting in Washington  DC Senator Clinton Presses Entergy CEO on Deadline for Sirens  Independent Inspectors and Safety Measures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today met with Entergy CEO J  Wayne Leonard in her office in Washington  DC to discuss several important issues relating to Indian Point    Specifically  Senator Clinton expressed her concerns to Mr  Leonard about Entergys failure to have the new siren system in place and asked for a progress report on the prospect of the company making the new deadline for operable and effective sirens  The Senator also asked the CEO to report on the status of Entergys efforts to identify and contain leaks of radioactive water at the plant  Finally  the Senator called on the CEO to commit to independent assessment of the plant that she and others have called for     At the meeting  Senator Clinton also presented Mr  Leonard with a letter outlining her concerns  pointing out that the steady drumbeat of problems have eroded public confidence in Indian Point    The litany of recent problems at Indian Point has eroded public confidence in the plant at a time when Entergy is beginning its re licensing process  Senator Clinton said  I urged Entergy to commit to an independent safety assessment at the plant so that concerns about safety and emergency preparedness can be addressed to the satisfaction of the community   In addition  I stressed the importance of getting the sirens operational on time       A copy of Senator Clintons letter is attached     July 19  2007   Mr  J  Wayne Leonard  Chief Executive Officer  Entergy   Dear Mr  Leonard    Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss Entergy s Indian Point Energy Center in Buchanan  New York      Since September 11th I have worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  Despite improvements in both Entergys management of Indian Point and NRC oversight  problems have persisted at the plant   For example  repeated failures of the sirens have raised questions about emergency preparedness  and leaks from spent fuel pools have prompted safety questions   The steady drumbeat of these and other problems have eroded public confidence in Indian Point      Concerns about these and other issues led me to call for the NRC to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment  ISA  at Indian Point   The NRC refused my request  and I have subsequently introduced legislation to require an ISA at the plant   I will continue to push that legislation  but I believe that it is in the best interests of the community  the NRC  and Entergy to begin such a review now  so that it can inform the re licensing process   With that goal in mind  I ask that you join in my call to have the NRC conduct an ISA at Indian Point   I believe that the best way for Entergy to demonstrate its confidence in Indian Point is to invite independent inspectors inside to examine the plant alongside the NRC      The ISA would be particularly valuable because the re licensing process does not review aspects of Indian Point operations that are the subject of routine inspection by NRC  nor does re licensing evaluate emergency preparedness   Residents and officials have expressed concerns about these and other lacks in the re licensing process to the NRC  and are pressing the NRC to address them   I share many of their concerns      As Entergy moves forward and begins meeting with New Yorkers to discuss re licensing  one of the most visible signals about Entergys competence and progress at Indian Point will be whether the company meets its commitment to have the new siren system in place by August 24th   As you know  I added a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to install a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated failures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power   That provision was signed into law in August of 2005  and the NRC set a January 2007 deadline for having the system operational   Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th  and subsequently missed the deadline   NRC fined Entergy  130 000  and Entergy has since committed to have the system operational by August 24th   It is critical that Entergy meet this deadline      Thank you again for meeting with me to discuss these concerns   I ask that you give strong consideration to my request that Entergy back an ISA at Indian Point       Sincerely     Hillary Rodham Clinton     Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Indian Point         ,0

1849,"SEN. SANDERS URGES PRESIDENT BUSH TO VISIT VERMONT
  Vermont has gotten a lot of attention this past week. ABC News talked about cheese and maple syrup. CNN called Vermont ""a picture-perfect place"" where the ""rivers and mountains and covered bridges are a draw to some 10 million visitors a year."" Both network news outlets noted, however, that of all the places President Bush has traveled since he became president almost seven years ago, Vermont is not on the list. In fact, Vermont is the only one of the 50 states Bush has not visited since taking office. 
   Senator Bernie Sanders has urged the president to visit Vermont. ""He'll have a good visit,"" the senator told CNN. [He] might be able to learn something,""

                            Obama Calls On Bush to Release Information on Private Security Contractors in Iraq Monday  September 24  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent President Bush the following letter  calling on him to immediately compile and release information on the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of the contracts  and the number of contractors killed or wounded   With an estimated 48 000 private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following    Last week  Obama filed an amendment to the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which requires federal agencies to compile and report information on security contractors to Congress   Obama originally offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674  in February  The text of the letter is below  Dear Mr  President  I am writing to express my concern about the lack of transparency and accountability in the U S  government   s use of private security contractors in Iraq   I was disturbed by recent press accounts describing a firefight in which Blackwater USA security contractors killed at least 9 people and wounded many others   This recent incident  which is under investigation by the Department of State  raises larger questions about the role of private security contractors and the impact their use has on our military efforts in Iraq    Little is known about what functions these security contractors are performing  how much their services are costing  and what rules of engagement they are following   Moreover  according to press accounts  Blackwater has been exempt from military regulations governing other security companies  such as restrictions on the use of offensive weapons  requirements to report shooting incidents  and compliance with a central tracking system that allows commanders to monitor the movements of security companies on the battlefield   In February  I introduced the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674    This legislation would require federal agencies to report to Congress on   the total number of security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  the total cost of the contractors  the number of contractors killed or wounded  information about the military and safety equipment provided to contractors  and a description of disciplinary action taken against contractors   The bill also would improve coordination between security contractors and U S  armed forces by requiring the issuance of rules of engagement  clarify the legal status of contractors  and require investigation of criminal misconduct committed by contractors     I have offered an amendment that includes several provisions drawn from S  674 to the FY 2008 Defense Authorization bill  which is currently before the Senate  and similar provisions have been included in the House version of the bill    With tens of thousands of private security employees operating in Iraq  and more than 1 000 contractors killed since 2003  the U S  government should immediately compile and release this critical information required by my legislation   The American people deserve to know how their taxpayer dollars are being spent abroad  whether American civilian contractors are adequately protected  and whether these contractors are abiding by American law  Accordingly  I request that you direct the appropriate federal agencies to compile the following information about private security contracts and provide it to Congress in a timely fashion    1  The number of persons performing private security work in Iraq and Afghanistan under contracts entered into by federal departments and agencies  including the Department of Defense  the Department of State  the Department of the Interior  the United States Agency for International Development  and the elements of the intelligence community  respectively   2  The companies awarded such contracts and subcontracts   3  The total cost of such contracts   4  The total number of persons who have been killed or wounded performing work under such contracts   5  A description of the military equipment and safety equipment provided for the protection of contractors under such contracts  and an assessment of the adequacy of such equipment   6  The policies and procedures through which federal departments and agencies instruct and inform contractors of the applicability of the laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan to their activities   7  The policies and procedures through which federal departments and agencies monitor contractors on their adherence to the laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan   8  The laws  if any  determined to have been broken in the performance of such contracts  including laws of the United States  Iraq  and Afghanistan  and  9  A description of the disciplinary actions that have been taken against persons performing work under such contracts by either the contractor concerned or the governments of

404,   Obama Says  1 Billion Shortfall in VA Health Care Budget Requires Emergency Funding   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Says  1 Billion Shortfall in VA Health Care Budget Requires Emergency Funding Tuesday  June 28  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  June 28  2005 OBAMA SAYS  1 BILLION SHORTFALL IN VA HEALTH CARE BUDGET REQUIRES EMERGENCY FUNDING WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama Tuesday told Veterans  Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson that the more than  1 billion shortfall in the VA health care budget requires emergency funding   I don t think anyone wants to look a returning soldier in the eye who fought and bled for our country and say  Sorry  but when it comes to getting health care  you re on your own    said Obama   We recently passed a budget where we had no problem finding billions and billions of dollars to give away in tax cuts  but when it comes to health care for veterans  the VA is forced to scrape for dollars by pilfering their rainy day funds   In a letter to Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison  R TX  on April 5  2005  VA Secretary Nicholson wrote   I can assure you that VA does not need emergency supplemental funds in FY 2005 to continue to provide the timely  quality service that is always our goal   At today s hearing  Secretary Nicholson reiterated his belief that the  1 billion shortfall in the VA health care budget does not constitute a crisis  Senator Obama told Secretary Nicholson that the  1 billion shortfall is a crisis for our nation s veterans  and that Congress should immediately provide the VA with the funding it needs to meet their health care needs   When we learn that the VA health care budget is more than  1 billion short  we shouldn t tell our veterans that there isn t a crisis  we should tell them that we will do what it takes to make sure that they get the health care services they earned  said Obama   That is why I once again am joining my colleagues in an effort to provide the VA with the funding it needs to fully meet the health needs of our veterans  Senator Murray s emergency supplemental funding bill is necessary to avoid what is clearly an on coming crisis in the VA health system   On March 26  2005  Senator Obama voted to add an additional  2 85 billion to the VA health care budget  but the amendment was defeated  Senator Obama is a member of the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee                                               ,1

582,   Obama  Durbin  Hare Introduce Bill to Improve Student Behavior in Schools   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Durbin  Hare Introduce Bill to Improve Student Behavior in Schools Tuesday  October  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Christina Mulka  Durbin   or Tim Schlittner  Hare  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Dick Durbin  D IL   and Representative Phil Hare  D IL  today introduced the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act  H R  3407  S  2111   which directs resources to innovative programs designed to teach positive behavior as a way to improve school climate and make it easier for students to learn   Positive Behavior Support  PBS  programs define and support appropriate behaviors by explicitly teaching students about good behavior and including it as part of the curriculum    PBS programs have resulted in improved school climate and more time spent on learning   For example  at Lincoln Elementary School in Chicago Heights  the number of students sent to an administrator   s office for fighting dropped by half over the course of a year   At Springfield High School in Springfield  out of school suspensions decreased by 38   allowing students to learn more by reclaiming 180 school days that would otherwise have been lost to suspensions  At Mark Twain Primary School in Kankakee  disciplinary referrals decreased dramatically  from 268 before PBS compared to 38 last year  at the same time  ISAT reading and math scores are at an all time high       America   s teachers deserve our long term commitment so that they can provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed     said Senator Obama      Positive Behavior Support programs have proven successful in Illinois and throughout the country   They teach good behavior and reduce the need for discipline in the classroom  in turn allowing more time for teachers to teach   We must expand these innovative programs to teach our students about positive behavior   Let s give our teachers this additional tool to support their teaching  and let   s give our children the benefit of high expectations and supports for good behavior   These programs would not only strengthen our schools  but would bolster our nation   s competitiveness by providing the best possible learning environments for our next generation of leaders        When students act out  the classroom environment is damaged making it more difficult for students to learn and teachers to teach     said Durbin      Good behavior is a skill that can be learned and should be taught   Unfortunately  in many cases  children do not receive this lesson at home  Illinois is one state that has developed a system to address this problem in the classroom   These Positive Support Behavior programs can serve as a national model to improve student behavior   The bill that Senator Obama  Congressman Hare and I are introducing today will give teachers the resources they need to improve their classroom environment and allow more time for academic instruction        The old formula of attempting to yield good behavior and academic performance by threatening students with detention or other punishment has run its course     Hare said     The PBS approach rewards students for doing the right thing while recognizing that success in school is contagious  My visit to Monmouth Roseville Junior High in February convinced me that many students in PBS programs are motivating each other to reach new heights  As a member of the Education and Labor Committee  I felt compelled to introduce the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act   I look forward to working with Senator Obama and the Illinois PBIS Network to ensure this bill is included in the soon to be reauthorized No Child Left Behind law     In PBS schools  the adults act together to set common expectations  not just for learning  but for the behaviors that support learning   In any given school  the problem might be a general lack of discipline  too much bullying  or a loss of instructional time due to suspensions   Schools can address any of these problems  using proven practices  supported by a collaborative network of researchers  schools  and teachers  along with universities and resource centers that work with over 6 700 schools in 38 states  More than 700 schools in Illinois already use PBS      Illinois leads the nation in implementing school wide PBIS with over 700 schools in 179 districts supported by the Illinois PBIS Network     said Lucille Eber  Ed D   State Director of the IL PBIS Network      These schools are experiencing decreases in discipline problems  increases in academic achievement  and improved measures of school safety   Additionally  schools that achieve full implementation show greater capacity for success with students who have more serious behavioral learning needs   More importantly  we have seen these results increase and sustain over the past nine years in Illinois schools     Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act  To support PBS efforts  the Positive Behavior for Effective Schools Act amends Elementary and Secondary Education Act  ESEA  to make PBS an allowable use of funds  and proposes an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services  More specifically  the Act  Provides flexibility for use of Title I funds  State agencies may use these funds to provide technical assistance and support to schools as they implement PBS   Schools may use funds to improve school climate and academic achievement  Amends the needs assessments for use of Title II funds  so that they may take into account improvement of school climate in awarding subgrants for professional development  Amends the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities provision to include support for programs  such as PBS  that improve school climate and reduce discipline problems  Amends school counseling provisions  to ensure that applications for grants should include information on the need for behavioral intervention services  such as PBS  Amends the Department of Education Organization Act  to establish an Office of Specialized Instructional Support Services   This office would coordinate the federal role in supporting counselors  school social workers  and others  who help teachers by providing academic and behavioral support for students  This legislation is supported by the American School Counselor Association  The Arc of the United States  National Association of State Directors of Special Education  and 23 other organizations                                     ,1

736,July 10  2007 Clinton Calls on Secretary Michael Chertoff to Explain Inadequate Homeland Security Funding for New York City and Long Island                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator will Raise Concerns about Homeland Security Funding at a Neeting with Chertoff this Week   Recent Figures Show Department of Homeland Security Still Does Not Take Threats Against New York Seriously                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC  In anticipation of a meeting with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff this Thursday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Secretary to explain the Departments reasoning behind the continual short changing of the New York metropolitan area when it comes to national homeland security funding  This year  New York will receive  134 million  which represents a 7 7  increase from last years funding but is far short of the  207 million it received in 2005   Senator Clinton emphasized that New York continues to be a top terrorist target and this repeated under funding threatens New York s ability to maintain its necessary high level of vigilance      I am shocked at the Department of Homeland Securitys continual disregard for the level of threat that New York is under and very disappointed that the Department still has not learned from its past mistakes on this critical issue  I am meeting with the Secretary on Thursday in the hopes that he will be forthcoming about why his department appears to be so blind to the threats facing the area and to express my very serious hopes that these reported figures do not reflect the actual amounts that New York will receive from the federal government  said Senator Clinton     Recent reports indicate that the New York metropolitan area  which includes New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties  will receive  134 million from the Department of Homeland Security under its Urban Area Security Initiative grant program for 2007  which represents a 7 7  increase over the  124 million awarded in 2006  but is still nowhere near the  207 million received in 2005  An announcement on the final amount is expected from the Department of Homeland Security shortly     Last year  Senator Clinton  along with Congressman Peter King  forced that Department of Homeland Security to reverse their massive cuts to homeland security funding for New York despite the fact that no state has been more affected by terrorism or is a greater target of a potential terrorist attack  Clinton and King questioned how the Department of Homeland Security could possibly claim that New York has only four places of national financial significance and no national monuments and icons and launched a postcard program urging New Yorkers to send Secretary Chertoff postcards of New York landmarks to remind the Secretary of the state s highly visible and recognizable icons and landmarks  and encouraged New Yorkers to follow suit   See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 256448    A copy of Senator Clintons letter is below     July 10  2007   The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C  20528   Dear Mr  Secretary    In advance of our meeting this week to discuss the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   I am writing to alert you that I intend to raise with you my concerns related to the disturbing reports that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  in its latest round of homeland security grants plans to only minimally increase the New York City Regions Homeland Security Grant funding for Fiscal Year 2007   Of particular concern is news that DHS will allocate only  134 million in Urban Areas Security Initiative  UASI  funding to New York City  a mere 7 7 percent increase from last years inadequate and dramatically reduced funding level      Last year the New York City region received  124 5 million under the UASI program  a 40 percent reduction from the allocation the region received in FY 2005   At the time  the Department stated that the regions application contained numerous flaws and as a result  poor grades were given to the application   The notion that the quality of a grant application somehow lessens the threat that the New York City Region faces is absurd   More disturbing was the Departments explanation that the New York City region lacked significant national monuments or icons     In the Conference Report that accompanied the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act  P L  109 295   it states that the Department should continue its efforts to evaluate UASI grant applications on the basis of risk and on how effectively these grants will address identified homeland security needs   The report goes on to state that in those areas where the risk is very high  the Department shall work aggressively to ensure these applications are produced in a manner in which appropriate levels of funding reflect the level of threat   Working under the assumption that the Department followed the instructions outlined in the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act  what is the explanation for the modest increase in homeland security funds for the New York City area   The Act also required the Department to announce these grants allocations by May 16  2007   If the recently reported figures  which are nearly two months after the deadline  are inaccurate  I hope that the Department corrects this error and allocates the funding needed by New York City and the surrounding region    You have repeatedly stated that homeland security funding should be targeted to the most at risk areas of the country   This was one of chief recommendations of the 9 11 Commission   As you well know  New York City is an area where the risk is particularly high   The recent threats and attacks in London and Glasgow indicate that the threat of attack is still ever present and that large urban areas continue to be most at risk   However  the Departments allocation to the New York City region last year and the proposed allocation for FY 2007  are wholly inconsistent with the threats the New York City region continues to face  as well as the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission    I look forward to our meeting this week and to your response to the questions and concerns that I have raised    Sincerely yours  Hillary Rodham Clinton        ,0
1873,"SEN. SANDERS SEEKS WEATHERIZATION FUNDS
  Sen. Bernie Sanders said today that he would fight to restore $38 million that the Bush administration wants to cut this year from a program that helps working people cope with high energy bills while protecting the environment.  
   The administration wants to reduce funding to $205 million for the program that supports state and local efforts to help families insulate their homes in order to reduce heating and air conditioning bills. Last year, $242.2 million was allotted. 
   ""At a time when this country has got to be extremely aggressive in terms of energy efficiency and addressing the crisis of global warming, I find it incredible that President Bush would actually lower the budget for the weatherization program,"" Sanders said. 
   ""I will do all that I can to reverse that course and make sure that lower income Vermonters and all Americans have the resources they need to insulate their homes, cut their heating bills and protect our environment,"" the senator added. 
   Sanders said he will seek to restore funds in a supplemental spending bill that the Senate takes up this week. 
   In Vermont, hundreds of homes have been retrofitted with insulation, storm windows and other improvements so that low-income people, including many seniors, do not waste large sums of money through energy inefficiency. 
   The program also helps the environment by decreasing the need for energy and making homes more energy-efficient. Sanders said that instead of building new power plants, and producing more energy, we should make certain through the weatherization program and other initiatives that the energy we produce is used more efficiently. 
   More than 5 million homes have been made more energy-efficient since 1979 through government weatherization programs. Unfortunately, more than 20 million low-income homes are still waiting for weatherization services.

1814,"SEN. SANDERS TO CREATE COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE U.S. WARTIME CONTRACTING ABUSES IN IRAQ, AFGHANISTAN
  The Senate reached final approval on Monday of a major Department of Defense policy bill that includes a provision cosponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders to create a commission to investigate U.S. wartime contracting abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""There is already a lot of evidence that they have overcharged the taxpayers of this country. Money that should've been going to our soldiers has been going to make very wealthy people even wealthier,"" Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. 
   The Commission on Wartime Contracting addresses rampant corruption and other problems with private companies operating in Iraq. The authority of a special inspector general will be expanded to monitor all wartime contracts in Afghanistan as well as Iraq. In Iraq alone, it was the special inspector general who discovered that $9 billion in reconstruction funds simply had vanished. 
   ""The evidence is clear that taxpayers are being ripped off for billions of dollars in no-bid contracts awarded to Halliburton and other firms,"" Sanders said. ""Astonishingly, we know that $9 billion spent on private contractors in Iraq is missing. We owe it to taxpayers to take a long, hard look at the conduct of contractors."" 
   Halliburton, the giant defense contractor that Vice President Cheney once headed, is an example of the private companies that have been awarded huge, no-bid contracts in Iraq. ""More than ever before in our history, the Bush administration has doled out millions and millions of dollars worth of no-bid contracts to Halliburton and other private firms operating in war zones,"" Sanders said.
   The commission also will identify new safeguards for companies that provide private security guards, such as the security contractor Blackwater USA, which is under investigation in the shooting deaths of 11 Iraqis last month and over a 2004 ambush in which four of its staff were killed.
   The legislation to create the commission - originally sponsored by Senators Sanders, Jim Webb, Claire McCaskill and other freshmen senators - was inspired by the World War II-era work of the ""Truman Committee."" Named for then-Senator Harry S Truman, the committee conducted hundreds of hearings and investigations into government waste and is credited with saving taxpayers more than $15 billion in 1943 dollars. 
   In the current conflict in Iraq, which already has dragged on for longer than World War II, the United States to date has spent $610 billion on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some 160,000 contractors work in Iraq today, 20,000-30,000 working on private security. The commission would investigate waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement of the contracts and contractors.
   The legislation was supported of taxpayer watchdog groups, such as the Project on Government Oversight, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Government Accountability Project, OMB Watch, and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.

                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized  76 5 million for defense projects and military construction benefiting the Capital Region   The  48 1 million for defense projects will include  5 million for Superpower  s High Temperature Superconductor Generators   32 4 million for the M777 Howitzer which benefits Watervliet Arsenal   2 5 million for Benet Labs  s ATLAS Raven   3 million for MTI Microfuel Cells   Hybrid Advanced Soldier Power program   2 million for Plug Power  s Fuel Cell for Continuity of Operations program  and  2 million for Starfire System  s FIRST program  In addition  the Committee approved  28 4 million in military construction funding for the region  including  5 5 million for the Army National Guard Readiness Center in Latham   3 million for the Army National Guard Readiness Center in Leeds and  19 9 million for the Navy Joint Reserve Center in Albany        The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2006 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill   The bill will now be sent to the Senate for approval          The Capital Region is already taking advantage of tremendous development opportunities for civilian and defense companies alike  This funding will only add to the region  s potential to support our troops and stimulate economic development     Senator Clinton said    I will continue to work to generate these meaningful investments so that we can build on the region  s potential to generate economic growth while supporting our national security           Superpower    High Temperature Superconductor Generators   5 Million  SuperPower is working to achieve commercial scale manufacturing of second generation High Temperature Superconducting  HTS  wire using yttrium barium copper oxide  2G wire  beginning in 2006  2G wire can provide immense benefits in electric power devices such as generators  motors  power cables  and transformers   HTS generators can produce the equivalent amount of electrical power as conventional generators  while requiring drastically smaller size and weight   The Navy has made a decision to implement electric drive on the next class of surface combatants and over the longer term to move towards all electric surface ships and submarines in future ship classes  The resulting electric plant architecture will enable electric warships to quickly divert a ship  s propulsion power for use by state of the art electrical based weapons and advanced long range sensors   The reduced size of the HTS generators is of particular relevance to the Navy for this application because it allows increased flexibility in ship architecture and enhanced power density and transient response  improving overall ship performance and survivability        Watervliet Arsenal    M777 Howitzer   32 4 Million  The M777A1 will be replacing the current M198 howitzer that had been in service for over 25 years   The M777 is a joint program for the U S  Marine Corps and the U S  Army   This technology will provide increased mobility  accuracy  and armament   Watervliet Arsenal produces the tubes for the M777 Howitzer  This funding increase will provide for and additional 14 M777 howitzers        Benet Labs    ATLAS Raven   2 5 Million  Funding of  2 5 million was authorized for the Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS  Raven Benet Labs at Watervliet Arsenal  ATLAS supports the current Army Vision by setting the basis for the development of ultra lightweight combat vehicles that will significantly enhance the ability of all services to rapidly deploy to trouble spots worldwide with a suite of extremely lethal  agile  and survivable vehicles  The ATLAS system will provide the enabling technologies for unprecedented reductions in the weight  up to 50   of large caliber high muzzle energy cannons  These weight reductions in the gun system will in turn bring the vehicle weight well under the 14 ton limit required for air transportability        The weight reductions will be achieved through the use of the Sonic Rarefaction Wave Gun  Raven   which has been demonstrated to reduce recoil impulse by 75  and bore heating by 50  with no loss of muzzle energy  The Raven concept functions just like a high velocity cannon until the projectile has traveled a predetermine distance down bore  At this time the breech is opened allowing the propellant gases to vent out the breech through a diverging nozzle thus generating forward thrust canceling much of the recoil force  Funding supported by this request would be utilized to define the materials and design requirements  perform initial engineering analysis  and develop composite materials  optimize manufacturing technologies and develop demonstrators of ATLAS structures        MTI Microfuel Cells    Hybrid Advanced Soldier Power   3 Million  Recognizing the fact that no single power source  battery nor fuel cells  will provide acceptable man portable power to meet the 72 hour operational requirement of many Department of Defense initiatives  funding will go towards the development of a hybrid fuel cell battery portable system   While a unique concept  this hybrid fuel cell battery concept is currently in use on a limited production basis in the commercial arena   The current program will incorporate advances in both Fuel Cell and Lithium Ion batteries to demonstrate a   real world    power system appropriate for 72 hour autonomous operation missions and with the flexibility to support currently fielded soldier systems  The successful completion of the Hybrid Advanced Soldier Power program will provide the critical portable power technology needed to meet increased mission requirements and weight limitations of today  s Armed Forces   This technology will also provide solutions for future portable power and associated logistical issues driven by the proliferation of electric devices unique to soldiers        Plug Power    Fuel Cell for Continuity of Operations   2 Million  The Department of Defense has a comprehensive and effective Defense Continuity Program  DCP  that ensures that Component Mission Essential Functions  MEF  continue under all circumstances across the spectrum of threats  including terrorist attack or grid failure   DCP planning relies on the use of dispersed locations  which require a unique portable power solution to support operations  one that not only provides extended run power but also can be safely operated indoors    To optimize fuel cell technology for this application  Plug Power will help develop and deliver to DOD  s Counter Terrorism Technology Support Office prototype fuel cell power generators for testing and evaluation   Demonstrations will be a part of the activity and the participants will establish procedures for monitoring  data collection  testing  evaluation  and reporting    The project report will evaluate the capability of fuel cell technology to meet identified DOD continuity requirements        Starfire Systems    FIRST program   2 Million  The Functionally Reactive Surfaces Technologies Program  FIRST  is continuing a Department of Defense initiative that would establish a  one stop shop  for research  development  systems integration  and technology transfer of surface reactive technologies into functional materials and devices for specialized clothing  sensors  tools and materials structures operating in hazardous environments  The technologies would be able to detect and automatically ameliorate the threat of any injury to the soldier on the battlefield as well as allow first responders to operate unimpeded or with enhanced capability for longer periods of time in the presence of biological  chemical  and fire threats  Functionally enhanced  renewable  biosurfaces in textile fiber or multifilm form will not only be able to neutralize bio and chemical attack but will also perform tissue repair and serve as an interface for enhanced sensory perception        The limiting factors that prevent this capability today are the lack of miniaturized wearable electronic components   The individual sensor  integral power  and active fabric technologies all need to be integrated  monitored wirelessly  and be intelligently controlled by an electronic circuit using minimal power   The goal of this step in the project is to demonstrate a level sufficient to fabricate a prototype integrated multi sensor package that can be evaluated in actual garment testing for soldiers   The textile patch hybrid circuit will support the integration and control of diverse technologies such as temperature sensors  chemical sensors  active features for physical comfort  and a textile based rechargeable battery  all integrated into a fire protective textile garment for both soldiers and domestic first responders        Latham Army National Guard Readiness Center   5 5 million  The Armed Services Committee bill includes  5 5 million to provide a readiness

1969,"GET HIRED GUNS OUT OF WAR ZONES
  Legislation that would phase out the use of private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan was unveiled Wednesday by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Jan Schakowsky. The bill would restore vital military functions to the military, reducing the reliance on unaccountable private security contractors in the war zones. As many as 48,000 heavily armed guards are among the private security contractors now operating in Iraq, performing sensitive functions that should be undertaken by U.S. military personnel. These jobs include protecting diplomats, training military and police officers, repairing and maintaining weapons systems, conducting interrogations and gathering intelligence. ""The Bush administration has made radical and dangerous changes in the structure of our military, and Congress needs to take a very hard look at that,"" Sanders said.
   ""To my mind, it is wrong and unacceptable for private companies to perform mission critical functions outside of the chain of command of the United States military and United States government in Iraq,"" Sanders said. Every time a Blackwater employee kills an Iraqi citizen, every time a security contractor assaults Iraqi nationals, America's standing with the people of Iraq dramatically worsens,"" Sanders said. 
   Military officers in the field have said military contractors operate like ""cowboys,"" using unnecessary and excessive force uncharacteristic of our enlisted soldiers. High-profile killings of innocent Iraqis, like the September 16, 2007 incident in which Blackwater guards killed 17 Iraqis and wounded 24, have severely damaged the U.S. mission in Iraq. Because many Iraqis do not differentiate between private security contractors and the U.S. armed forces, the behavior of private contractors has caused Iraqis to lose confidence in our military. 
   The Stop Outsourcing Security (S.O.S.) Act would:
   * Restore vital military functions to the military and reduce the reliance on private security contractors in the theater of battle. 
   * Require that all diplomatic security in Iraq be undertaken by U.S. government personnel within six months of enactment. Existing security contracts would be phased out by January 1, 2009, in places where Congress has authorized the use of force. The White House could seek exceptions, but any contracts remaining in effect after that date would be subject to congressional oversight. 
   * Allow Congress to view any current security contract exceeding $5 million. Agencies with military contractors would have to report the number of contractors employed in Iraq and Afghanistan, disclose the total cost of the contracts, the numbers of contractors wounded or killed in Iraq and Afghanistan, and make public any disciplinary actions against employees of the private firms. 
   ""The use of private security contractors in Iraq has undermined our presence there, weakening the valiant efforts that our soldiers are making to build strong and positive relations with the Iraqi people,"" Sanders said. 
   ""Iraqis, understandably, are not able to distinguish between American soldiers, who operate under strict rules and careful regulations, and private contractors, who don't follow such rules and v regulations. Astonishingly, contract employees, unlike American soldiers, are not held responsible for what they do to Iraqi citizens. 
   I also find it troubling when personnel employed by private contractors are paid far more than soldiers in the U.S. military who are putting their lives on the line every day. This is wrong from a position of equity and it is also wrong in terms of the long term future of our military both in terms of lowering morale and in attracting the best people in our armed forces.
   ""Every day approximately 170,000 American soldiers risk their lives in Iraq. Meanwhile, while some of our soldiers qualify for food stamps and their families struggle to survive economically, some employees of such companies as Blackwater, DynCorp International and Triple Canopy earn as much as $1,000 a day. Not even four-star generals earn as much as Blackwater employees. 
   ""It is time to let our capable American military do what they are supposed to do - train the military and police, guard convoys, repair weapons, administer military prisons, and perform military intelligence. 
   ""It is time to end this two-tier pay system developed by the anti-government, pro-privatization agenda of Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld.
   ""The Stop Outsourcing Security Act will restore vital military functions to the military, reducing our reliance on unaccountable private security contractors in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   ""It will require that all mission critical and emergency essential functions be carried out by American troops, not private operatives. 
   ""It will ensure that State Department personnel will be guarded by American troops, not by private contractors from Blackwater and other security firms. If the President and Vice President of the United States can be protected by the federal employees of the U.S. Secret Service, so can the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq. 
   ""It will also give Congress oversight on the contracts with security contractors. And it will fix a major problem: no longer will any private contract employee accused of a crime be spirited out of 
   ""This is good and needed legislation. I am glad Jan Schakowsky is introducing it today, and I am proud to be introducing it in the Senate.""

1565,December 19  2007 Senator Clinton Reintroduces Legislation to Link Congressional Pay Raises to Increase in the Federal Minimum Wage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that she has reintroduced her legislation to link Congressional pay increases to increases in the federal minimum wage   In addition to gradually raising the federal minimum wage  the bill would also require the federal minimum wage to be increased by the same percentage amount as Congressional salaries every year     If we in Congress can give ourselves a raise  surely we can raise the pay of working families struggling to make ends meet   Even as Congress gave itself pay increases year after year  it took Congress ten long years to increase the minimum wage for the rest of America   My bill would ensure that working families faced with a rising cost of living each year are not forced to wait another ten years for an increase in the minimum wage   This is the right and fair thing to do for hardworking Americans  said Senator Clinton    The bill  the Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act of 2007  was inspired by an idea submitted to SinceSlicedBread com  the Service Employees International Unions contest that asked Americans for bold ideas that would make life better for working families    In 1989  Congress passed legislation that provided for an automatic salary increase for its Members every year tied to an inflation adjusted cost of living allowance  COLA   Congress can decline to accept the pay raise and has done so five times since the automatic increase was put into effect   Pursuant to this new law  Congress in 1991 also gave itself a 25 percent salary increase to make up for past years when its salary remained unchanged     In the decade since Congress last increased the minimum wage  Members of Congress raised their own salaries by  31 600  while refusing to raise the pay of millions of hardworking parents who were struggling to make ends meet on the minimum wage     Senator Clinton is a strong advocate of increasing the minimum wage  Senator Clinton was an original cosponsor and vocal supporter of legislation that was introduced by Senator Kennedy and enacted into law earlier this year to increase the federal minimum wage to  7 25 per hour over a two year period         ,0

1752,"SEN. SANDERS ISSUES STATEMENT ON FISCAL 2008 BUDGET RESOLUTION
  Statement By Sen. Bernard Sanders:
   Let me begin by thanking Chairman Conrad and his staff for their very hard work in crafting this important Budget Resolution. 
   Mr. Chairman, as you know, a budget is more than just a long list of numbers. A budget is a statement about our values and our priorities, and the time is long overdue for the United States Congress to get its priorities right, to begin to stand up for the middle class and working families of this country, rather than multinational corporations and the wealthiest people who, year after year after year, have had their way on budget initiatives. 
   Mr. Chairman, when we analyze the merits of a federal budget, we have to begin by taking a very serious look at the economic reality facing the American people. In other words, what is really going on in the lives of our people? 
   On many occasions our committee has heard testimony from a representative of the Bush Administration. And over and over again each and every person tells us that the economy is doing great; to use Treasury Secretary Paulson's word, it is just ""marvelous.""  
   Well, I can tell you with a good deal of certainty that the people in my State of Vermont don't think this economy is ""marvelous,"" and I don't believe that the middle-class and working families of this country share that view either. 
   In fact, the economic reality facing the vast majority of our working people is that the middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing and tens of millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages than they used to. In Vermont and throughout this country, parents are wondering why, despite a huge increase in technology and worker productivity, there is a strong likelihood that, for the first time in the modern history of our country, their kids will have a lower standard of living than they do - the American dream in reverse. 
   Mr. Chairman, how can the economy be doing great when more than five million Americans have slipped into poverty since the President has been in office, including over one million children? 
   How can the economy be doing great when median income for working-age families has declined for five years in a row and when the personal savings rate is below zero - something which has not happened since the Great Depression? 
   How can the economy be doing great when almost seven million Americans have lost their health insurance since President Bush has been in office and when, according to the USDA, 35 million Americans in our country struggled to put food on the table last year and hunger in America is increasing? 
   How can our economy be doing great when college students are graduating with about $20,000 in debt and some 400,000 qualified high school students don't go to college in the first place because they can't afford it? 
   How can our economy be doing great when home foreclosures skyrocketed to the highest level in nearly four decades according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, and when we have lost over three million manufacturing jobs since President Bush has been in office, including about 10,000 in my State of Vermont? 
   How can our economy be doing great when 3 million fewer American workers have pension coverage today than when President Bush took office and half of private sector American workers have no pension coverage whatsoever? 
   Mr. Chairman, when the President and his Administration tell us the economy is doing great, the truth is that he is right - in one sense. While the economy is not doing well for the middle class or working families of our country, it is doing well for the wealthiest people in this country. That is true. The wealthiest people in our country are becoming wealthier - much wealthier. That is the reality. 
   The reality is that the upper 1 percent of the families in America today, have not had it so good since the 1920s. According to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the wealthiest 400 Americans increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 trillion. The 400 wealthiest Americans are worth $1.25 trillion. 
   Mr. Chairman, I've given this outline of the economy in order to place the debate about the budget in context. If the rich are becoming richer while the middle class is shrinking and poverty is increasing, how do we respond to that through the budget process? 
   The President, in his budget proposal, has given us his answer. 
   Despite the growing health care crisis, he has proposed to cut Medicare and Medicaid by $280 billion over the next decade and to inadequately fund the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Despite the reality that we have 23,000 wounded in Iraq, and tens of thousands more who will be coming home with PTSD or Traumatic Brain Injury, the President has, once again, inadequately funded the needs of our veterans - as he has year after year. In fact, since President Bush has been in office an estimated one million veterans have been denied access to health services at the VA. 
   Despite a horrendous crisis in child care access and affordability for working families, the President has, in his budget, reduced the number of children receiving child care assistance by 300,000 and cut funding for Head Start. 
   Despite millions of homeowners paying outrageously high property taxes the President has, in his budget, further retreated from the federal commitment to special education and cut funding for that program. This will result in a lowering of the quality of education and increases in property taxes. His proposed budget would also make it harder young people can go to college without going deeply into debt. 
   Somehow, while cutting programs and ignoring the needs of the working families of our country, of veterans, of children and our seniors, the President has reached the conclusion in his budget that we do have enough money as a government to provide enormous tax breaks to the wealthiest people in our society - $739 billion in tax cuts for households earning more than one million per year over the next decade. 
    Part of the President's budget calls for the complete elimination of the Estate Tax - a tax which now applies only to the wealthiest 3/10th of 1 percent of our population. The elimination of this tax would provide an estimated trillion dollars in tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires between 2012 to 2021. One multi-billionaire family, the Walton family which owns WalMarts, would receive an estimated $32 billion in tax relief. 
   Cut-backs for the needs of working families and the poor, and huge tax breaks for billionaires is what the President's budget is really all about. 
   While the Budget Resolution prepared by Chairman Conrad that we will be debating today is far from perfect, it is much more responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans than the President's. Instead of cutting back on the educational needs of this country, this Budget Resolution provides over $6 billion more than the President's request for education, including significant increases for Pell Grants, Head Start, Title I, and special education. 
   Instead of cutting back on health-care, this Budget Resolution provides an increase of $2.8 billion over the President's request for health-care including strong funding for community health centers and the National Health Service. 
   Instead of cutting back on the needs of our veterans, this Budget Resolution provides a $3.3 billion increase over the President's budget for our nation's veterans, one of my top priorities. 
   But, Mr. Chairman, I think that, over the long-term, we can and must do much better in establishing our budgetary priorities than this budget does. This is a good start but we have a very long way to go. 
   Last week, I introduced the National Priorities Act which would expand the middle class, reduce the gap between the rich and the poor and lower the poverty rate. The basic premise of that legislation is pretty simple. We raise $130 billion in new revenue by rescinding the tax breaks that President Bush gave to the wealthiest 1 percent, spend $100 billion on the needs facing ordinary Americans and provide $30 billion to lower the deficit. 
   If, as a nation, we are serious about addressing the long-neglected needs of the working people of this country and creating a more egalitarian society, we have got to change our national priorities. The wealthiest people in this country are doing just fine. It's time that we acted on behalf of working families and the middle class. 
   Mr. Chairman, while I appreciate all of your hard work and the work of your staff, I do have one area of serious concern that I feel compelled to raise and that is the level of mandatory veterans funding provided in the bill. 
   On the discretionary side of veterans programs, you deserve tremendous credit for providing a funding level that begins to meet the needs of those who have served this country. Your funding is very much in line with the View and Estimates that were unanimously approved by the majority on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. As a member of that committee as well, I want to thank you for working with us to deal with the severe under-funding that veterans have experienced in health care and other areas over the years. 
   Your funding level is also very much in line with the Independent Budget, the annual recommendations developed by some of our nation's leading veterans service organizations. From my experience, this is the first time in a long time that we have seen a budget resolution that seriously addresses the needs of veterans that are funded by discretionary veterans programs. 
   As you know, however, the Views and Estimates provided by the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee also provided a list of much-needed amendments to a relatively small number of veterans programs that are funded with mandatory spending. The proposed changes totaled some $252.5 million in FY 2008. 
   Given the large number of reforms that could be enacted on the mandatory side, the Senate Veterans Committee proposed only a small number of the most pressing changes. Let me give you an idea of what those changes are: 
   The first would undo a long-standing practice that cuts the disability benefits of disabled veterans by some $20 million a year to help lower the deficit by rounding down the disability payment the veteran would otherwise be entitled to. As part of the new majority, we should reject this practice which effectively helps balance the budget on the backs of disabled veterans 
   In addition, the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee recommends that we increase the burial benefit and plot allowance - which are currently at levels originally approved in 1973 - so that veterans' family get back at least some of their lost purchasing power. In a $3 trillion budget is there really not the funding to give veterans families more than $300 to purchase a burial plot? 
   We also want to make sure that veterans' widows who have minor children get back the purchasing power they have lost since 2005 because they have been denied a cost of living increase in their Dependency and Indemnity Compensation transitional benefit since that time. 
   We need to make sure that value of grants that help disabled veterans modify their homes and cars are updated so that these American heroes can live active and dignified lives when they return to their communities. We are talking about veterans who have suffered a disability in the service of their country. We hear a lot about increasing care at Walter Reed, but what happens when these veterans return home and don't have the money to modify a car so they can remain active in their often rural communities. 
   Also, we want to make a very small increase in the amount of life insurance that totally disabled veterans can purchase, and we need a small increase to maintain current services for state approving agencies that are responsible for making sure that education and training programs in the various states are legitimate. This state approving agency funding is needed to maintain current service due to the expiration of an extended ceiling in the amount of mandatory funds available for this program. Finally, after all these years, we need to keep our promise to those remaining Filipino veterans who served in the United States armed forces during World War II but who have been denied promised benefits. 
   Mr. Chairman, I understand the very difficult task that you and your staff have in putting together a budget that will pass the United States Senate. And I know that you personally support all these changes. Mr. Chairman, as tight as this budget is, and recognizing how much you have done for veterans in this bill, we have to find room in this budget to accommodate these very, very modest fixes that will help our disabled veterans, and their widows and families. I sincerely hope that we and our staffs can work out some agreement on how to address these issues during this mark-up process so we can produce a budget that we can all support.

                     Harkin  Hagel  Obama Take Action to Prevent Suicide Among Active Duty Soldiers Thursday  January 31  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Jennifer Mullin  Harkin    Jordan Stark  Hagel   or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Washington Post reports today on record number of soldier suicides last year   highest rate since 1990 Washington  D C    As news reports reveal growing numbers of suicide among soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Iraq  U S  Senators Tom Harkin  D IA   Chuck Hagel  R NE   and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced major legislation aimed at preventing suicide among active duty members of the military  The Senators  bill  the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act  would direct the Department of Defense  DoD  to create a comprehensive suicide prevention program including annual training for soldiers  improved instruction for field medics and post deployment assistance  The legislation authorizes six million dollars for implementation of the programs  A companion measure will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Leonard Boswell  D IA   Today s Washington Post reported that Army statistics show that 121 soldiers committee suicide last year   a 20 percent increase from 2006  This is the highest rate of Army suicides recorded since the Army started collecting this data in 1980  The Post also reported that last year about 2 100 soldiers  injured themselves or attempted suicide  compared with about 350 in 2002    These startling statistics should serve as a wakeup call that suicide among soldiers and veterans is more than a problem  it is an epidemic   said Senator Harkin   Thankfully  our push to provide America s veterans with a suicide prevention program was heard last year  when the President signed the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act into law  But there is more work ahead   especially in serving our active duty military personnel  We can and must act quickly to save our soldiers who are so bravely fighting for our country     Since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan there has been a significant increase in suicides among active duty soldiers   This is a reality our country must face as we are engaged in two conflicts   This legislation will enhance and strengthen the Defense Department s suicide prevention programs for all active duty military personnel   It is critical for our service members to be provided with the necessary mental health services they deserve   There can be no higher priority for America than our soldiers and their families   said Senator Hagel   Our nation s heroes deserve our greatest support and commitment  and we must immediately address the tragic increase in suicide rates among our active duty service members   said Senator Obama   The men and women who serve our country should expect nothing less than world class medical care  treatment  rehabilitation  and counseling services   Suicide can be prevented  and we must do everything we can to help those who are suffering   This bill will help ensure there are comprehensive suicide prevention programs throughout the military  and I commend Senator Harkin s leadership on this needed legislation   Specifically  the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act will   Conduct a service wide mental health campaign to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues  encourage people to seek help when needed  and increase awareness that mental health is essential to overall health and that treatments can promote recovery from mental illness   The campaign should raise awareness about assistance for substance abuse issues  as well as relationship and financial difficulties   An outreach campaign should also focus health professionals both on and off military installations to raise awareness of the health needs of returning military personnel    Implement annual suicide prevention training of all active duty  Reserve  and National Guard members and involve military leadership in outreach efforts by incorporating suicide prevention training in officer and senior enlisted training courses    Strengthen basic lifesaver training and training for military medics and medical personnel to incorporate recognition of risk factors for suicide  identification of signs and symptoms of mental health issues  and protocols for responding to crisis situations involving members of the Armed Forces who may be at high risk for suicide     Utilize crisis response teams within units to prevent and respond to traumatic events   Such teams will consist of key personnel such as medical staff  chaplains  family support staff  and peers      Provide post deployment follow up and assistance for family members and peers of members of the Armed Services on mental health problems  substance use  and financial and relationship difficulties  including information on resources to address these issues       Provides resources to the Department of Defense to examine innovative and effective strategies to recruit qualified uniformed mental health professionals    Provides resources to the Department of Defense to examine innovative and effective ways to fight the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment    Late last year  Harkin s push for the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to provide a comprehensive suicide prevention program for returning soldiers became a reality through the enactment of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Action   named after Joshua Omvig  a soldier from Grundy Center who took his own life after returning from Iraq  Harkin s legislation directs the VA to integrate mental health services into veterans  primary care  and step up counseling and other mental health services for returning war

622,   Kennedy  Maloney Fight for Workplace Flexibility for Families   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Kennedy  Maloney Fight for Workplace Flexibility for Families Thursday  December  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                   CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   Meghan O    Shaughnessy  Maloney   Jamie Radice  Dodd   Sarah Gegenheimer  Clinton   Amy Brundage  Obama   or Aaron Albright  Miller  WASHINGTON  DC    Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Representative Carolyn Maloney introduced the Working Family Flexibility Act  which will give working Americans the right to request flexible work options in order to balance the demands of their jobs and home life  Senators Dodd  Clinton  Obama  and Congressman George Miller are co sponsoring this bill    This legislation will allow employers and employees to engage in constructive dialogue over modifying where and when employees work so they can find the best solutions to the work life challenges they face    Attached are three letters of endorsement for this legislation from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  the National Partnership for Women   Families  and the Center for Law and Social Policy   Senator Kennedy said     Our working families deserve a 21st century answer for these 21st century job challenges   Greater flexibility is an essential part of the response   More than 80  of workers would like more flexibility in their jobs   Almost half of them  however  worry that asking for such flexibility will jeopardize their careers   The Working Families Flexibility Act we   re introducing today will give employees the ability to ask for flexible arrangements without fear        This bill would be a big step toward helping employees create a more flexible work schedule and strike a better work family balance   We need to recognize that most American families do not have the luxury of having a stay at home parent  With both parents working  and millions of single parents working  we need workplaces that can help people be both good employees and good parents  Countries that have already introduced balanced work family policies find they are a win win   they help create stable families  a more productive workforce  and positive economic outcomes     said Congresswoman Maloney     This legislation marks the beginning of an important conversation about the needs of American workers as they try to juggle the demands of their job with the needs of their families     said Senator Dodd      I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy in introducing a bill that will help make this juggling act a little easier   Flexibility meets the needs of employees and employers alike and is an essential element of any successful work environment      Between trying to make ends meet and carving out time to care for their young children and aging relatives  parents across America are often stretched thin and need flexibility at work   Senator Clinton said   I m pleased to join Senator Kennedy in introducing this important piece of legislation to support our nation s working families    We ve heard a lot of talk about family values but this important legislation would actually help families with the increasingly challenging job of earning a living and raising kids or caring for an ill relative   Senator Obama said   The demands of the global economy mean that Americans are working harder and harder  If we re going to have strong families  we need to make it easier for Americans to work more flexible hours      American workers shouldn   t have to choose between their financial security and the important needs of their family   Family friendly policies work for both workers and their employers by increasing recruitment and retention rates  decreasing absenteeism  and improving productivity     said Congressman Miller   SUMMARY OF WORKING FAMILIES FLEXIBILITY ACT   The Working Families Flexibility Act gives employees the right to request flexible work options   This legislation will ensure that working Americans can ask their employer for modified schedules so they can balance the demands of their jobs and their home life   The legislation is patterned on similar laws in Europe that have been implemented with great success   Under this legislation  An employee may request to modify his or her hours  schedule  or work location  Employees and employers will engage in an interactive process to discuss the employee   s needs and how to address them with no or minimal disruption to the employer   s business   Employers who deny a request must explain the grounds for the denial   Employees who make requests are protected from retaliation   Small businesses are exempt from the law   The Department of Labor will develop regulations to smoothly administer the process  while ensuring the protection of employees    legal rights

1120,June 14  2007 Senate Armed Services Committee Approves Clinton Measures to Help Wounded Servicemembers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Bill Now Goes to Senate Floor                Washington  DC  The Senate Armed Services Committee today approved a series of amendments offered by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  to strengthen the committees bill to address problems facing our wounded servicemembers   The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act was approved today by the Senate Armed Services Committee and will now go to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate   A cosponsor of the legislation  Senator Clinton had succeeded in including a number of provisions in the bill from her Heroes at Home Act of 2007  Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act and Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act  among others  Read More   Noting Senator Clintons leadership  Senator Carl Levin  D MI   Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  today noted that Senator Clinton has introduced more legislation to address the problems facing wounded servicemembers than any other Senator    We have gone a long way today toward meeting our responsibility to our servicemembers to provide the healthcare and support they need   I am proud that the Senate Armed Services committee has approved measures I put forward to improve screening for Traumatic Brain Injury  the signature wound of the war in Iraq  address problems servicemembers are facing as they transition between DoD and VA healthcare systems  and cut red tape preventing wounded servicemembers from receiving needed disability benefits   These are urgently needed steps for our servicemembers and their families  said Senator Clinton      Senator Clinton today secured approval of an amendment to give the Department of Defense a 180 day deadline for implementing a screening protocol for Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI    This builds on a measure Senator Clinton secured in the bill  first introduced as part of her Heroes at Home Act of 2007  to improve detection of mild and moderate TBI by developing an objective assessment tool to measure cognitive functioning of solders both prior to and after deployment   The bill approved today by the Committee also includes elements of another Heroes at Home Act of 2007 proposal to provide needed advice and training for families struggling to take care of a loved one with brain injuries and psychological injuries      In addition  Senator Clinton today won approval of an amendment to ensure that active duty and veterans healthcare services are available to all current and former members of the Armed Services who were injured after October 7  2001  not just those injured after implementation of the bill   Senator Clinton also cosponsored an amendment approved today to make sure that active duty and veterans health care services includes VA benefits so that active duty servicemembers receiving care at VA facilities are not denied access to VA benefits that can facilitate their rehabilitation and recovery   Senator Clinton first called for providing a two year overlap of active duty and medically retired health care services and benefits for injured members and former members of the Armed Services as part of her Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act following reports that soldiers were experiencing problems receiving the healthcare they need as they transition from Department of Defense to VA care     The Senate Armed Services Committee also approved an amendment today offered by Senator Clinton to make sure that efforts underway by the DoD and VA to create a joint electronic medical record result in a DoD VA medical record that is compatible and synchronized with the national efforts to develop a nationwide coordinated health IT infrastructure  an issue on which Senator Clinton has been a leader   This measure builds on provisions  which would provide oversight and leadership for a joint DoD VA interagency office  that Senator Clinton secured in the bill from her Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act   The SASC bill approved today also includes a measure from Senator Clintons Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act that would reform the current flawed disability rating system for wounded servicemembers by ending the flawed DoD rating system and having military departments adopt the VA disability rating system        Senator Clinton today also secured approval of an amendment to ensure needed oversight of the disability rating system for wounded servicemembers by continuing Government Accountability Office  GAO  reviews of treatment of wounded servicemembers   The amendment also will ensure that disability benefit determination cases under review are prohibited from being reduced by a new determination   Senator Clinton proposed similar measures as part of her Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act   The SASC bill approved today also includes two other measures from her Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act  a measure to help make sure servicemembers receive disability benefits they need and deserve by requiring an independent review of disability benefit ratings below 20 percent and increasing disability benefits as warranted and a provision to require that the shortage of Physical Evaluation Board liaison officers and attorneys be addressed by the DoD and VA    Finally  the Senate Armed Services Committee today approved an amendment offered by Senators Clinton and Collins  co chairs of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimers Disease  to require that any longitudinal studies on members of the Armed Forces with TBI also identify early signs of Alzheimers disease  Parkinsons disease and other neurodegeneration   Head injuries  after age and family history  are one of the leading risk factors for an individual developing Alzheimers disease   This amendment builds on a provision for a 15 year longitudinal study on long term health and mental health consequences of TBI that Senator Clinton got enacted in the FY2007 John Warner National Defense Authorization Act     The final bill also includes a proposal from the TBI Access to Options Act  introduced by Senator Clinton along with Senator Evan Bayh  D IN  to provide medical advocates for traumatic brain injured servicemembers in the transition from DOD to VA medical treatment  preventing them from getting caught in bureaucracy and red tape       As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need  She has introduced legislation to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families  Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits  She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform  She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing and was recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need  She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families    Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning

1441,October 17  2007 Clinton  Delauro Introduce Bill to Strengthen America s Child Care Workforce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today joined with child care providers  labor leaders  and advocates to introduce legislation to strengthen Americas child care workforce   The Quality Child Care for America Act invests in quality child care by funding workforce development initiatives and workforce enhancement for child care providers  who all too often lack the training and resources they need to ensure high quality care for our children     When we neglect child care  we are neglecting our children   By failing to provide the resources needed to attract and keep people in the field and improve training  we risk failing children in their formative years  as well as parents who rely on child care to go to work to support their family  said Senator Clinton   The Quality Child Care for America Act will help these children succeed by helping child care providers succeed           The Quality Child Care for America Act is not only about helping parents find peace of mind  the knowledge that their child will be safe and sound in the hours they cannot be with them  and about creating a strong foundation to ensure every child has a fair shot to achieve his or her dreams  but also about helping child care providers receive the benefits they are due  said Congresswoman DeLauro   To make quality childcare available and to make that investment pay off  our nation needs a well trained and educated child care workforce   This is about investing in the future of our country  in our workforce and in our children  With this legislation  Senator Clinton and Congresswoman DeLauro are insisting upon a greater investment in quality child care and the professionals who do this important work  These men and women have committed their lives to providing quality care for our children and families   Its time for our nation to match their commitment   And the way to do that is by passing the Quality Child Care for America Act  said Gerald McEntee  President of the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  AFSCME   By seeking a comprehensive solution to the child care crisis  this bill recognizes the critically important contribution child care providers make every day to ensure kids can get the quality early education they need to grow and learn  said Service Employees International Union  SEIU  Secretary Treasurer  Anna Burger  Child care workers  who are almost one hundred percent female  can have a critical impact on the successful development of the children in their care   Yet they are among the lowest paid workers in our society  they often lack health insurance or other benefits  and all too often are forced to hold second jobs  said Nancy Duff Campbell  Co President of the National Womens Law Center   The Quality Child Care for America Act begins to address these serious concerns by providing additional federal resources to states to fund initiatives aimed at supporting the child care workforce and improving child care quality  Strengthening Americas child care workforce is a critical investment in our children and families   Every week  more than 12 million children under six years old are in child care   Approximately half of these are three years old and younger   High quality  developmentally appropriate child care has been shown to increase a childs chances for success in school later in life and although many child care providers in centers and in homes across the country are providing high quality care  too many lack the support needed to improve child care quality   At the same time  too many child care providers cannot afford to stay in the profession  rarely have access to healthcare or benefits and receive little or no training   The lack of affordable  high quality child care not only affects children  it is also an important factor in workers capacity to maintain employment   High turnover remains an issue for the child care field   Thirty five percent of employed child care providers in 2005 were no longer employed the following year  The Quality Child Care for America Act will help address the child care crisis by investing in child care professionals   The bill amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act to create a  200 million set aside fund for child care centers and home based providers to improve quality as well as compensation and support for child care professionals   States will be able to distribute these funds to public and private child care centers and home based child centers  with a maximum of 30 percent of funding directed to non center based providers   Funding can be used towards compensation or benefits for child care providers  as well as continuing education and training   Providers will be required to maintain the expenditures put toward child care in the previous fiscal year  but funding provided under the

353,   Obama Urges Bernanke  Paulson to Fight Foreclosures  Hold Homeownership Summit   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Urges Bernanke  Paulson to Fight Foreclosures  Hold Homeownership Summit Thursday  March 22  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson urging them to immediately convene a homeownership preservation summit with key stakeholders to fight foreclosures driven by growth in the subprime mortgage market  The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson  There is grave concern in low income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures   Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market  I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders  investors  loan servicing organizations  consumer advocates  federal regulators and housing related agencies to assess options for private sector responses to the challenge  We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes  And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending  both must act and act quickly   Working together  the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger   Rampant foreclosures are in nobody   s interest  and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices  preserving homeownership  and stabilizing housing markets   The summit should consider best practice loan marketing  underwriting  and origination practices consistent with the recent  and overdue  regulators    Proposed Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending   The summit participants should also evaluate options for independent loan counseling  voluntary loan restructuring  limited forbearance  and other possible workout strategies  I would also urge you to facilitate a serious conversation about the following    What standards investors should require of lenders  particularly with regard to verification of income and assets and the underwriting of borrowers based on fully indexed and fully amortized rates  How to facilitate and encourage appropriate intervention by loan servicing companies at the earliest signs of borrower difficulty  How to support independent community based organizations to provide counseling and work out services to prevent foreclosure and preserve homeownership where practical  How to provide more effective information disclosure and financial education to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly and that deception is never a source of competitive advantage  How to adopt principles of fair competition that promote affordability  transparency  non discrimination  genuine consumer value  and competitive returns  How to ensure adequate liquidity across all mortgage markets without exacerbating consumer and housing market vulnerability  Of course  the adoption of voluntary industry reforms will not preempt government action to crack down on predatory lending practices  or to style new restrictions on subprime lending or short term post purchase interventions in certain cases   My colleagues on the Senate Committee on Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs have held important hearings on mortgage market turmoil and I expect the Committee will develop legislation   Nevertheless  a consortium of industry related service providers and public interest advocates may be able to bring quick and efficient relief to millions of at risk homeowners and neighborhoods  even before Congress has had an opportunity to act  There is an opportunity here to bring different interests together in the best interests of American homeowners and the American economy   Please don   t let this opportunity pass us by    Sincerely  U S  Senator Barack Obama                                  ,1

1801,"VERMONT VETERANS
  A Vermont program that reaches out to troops after they return home from tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan will receive $3 million in the coming year. The funding was included in legislation already signed by President Bush. Another $3 million is set aside in the bill for pilot projects in other states. ""This funding will enable us to do everything we can to help National Guard and Reserve members and their families receive the help they need as they readjust and transition back to life here at home,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said. ""At a time when returning soldiers across the country are suffering from extremely high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, these funds should play a vitally needed role."" A member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Sanders fought for the funds for both programs.  
   Sanders thanked Senator Patrick Leahy for helping to preserve the funding as the legislation moved through Congress. ""The men and women of the National Guard have answered every call to duty with skill and sacrifice, and they have a right to expect the equipment they need in the field and the support they and their families deserve at home,"" Leahy said. ""In between drills after long deployments, it is important to keep in touch with returned soldiers and offer them any counseling or help they might need. I have been glad to work with Senator Sanders to secure additional funding for the Vermont Guard's program.""
   Sanders was joined at a press conference in his Senate office in Burlington by Vermont National Guard Adjutant General Michael D. Dubie, and Jim MacIntyre, coordinator of the Vermont National Guard Outreach Team.
   It is important that Vermont expand this program so that it becomes a model for the nation, Sanders said, because:
   * According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, the number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who experienced PTSD increased by 70 percent - or by 20,000 cases - during the last year. 
   * A Defense Department Task Force on Mental Health found 38 percent of soldiers and 31 percent of Marines report psychological concerns, such as traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder, after returning from deployment. The Associated Press added that among members of the National Guard, the figure is much higher - 49 percent - with numbers expected to grow because of repeated deployments. 
   * A CBS news investigation found that in 2005 there were at least 6,256 suicides in 45 states among those who served in the armed forces. One age group stood out: veterans aged 20 through 24 who have served during the war in Iraq. They had the highest suicide rate among all veterans, estimated between two and four times higher than civilians the same age. 
   * Two signature injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan are PTSD and traumatic brain injury. Some have one or the other, some have both. Many of these injuries are invisible from the outside. Symptoms include nightmares and other sleep disorders, trouble concentrating, anger, recklessness, and self-medication with drugs and alcohol. From 125,000 to 150,000 U.S. troops may have suffered mild, moderate or severe brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan 
   * As the Disabled American Veterans reports, data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs show that of the 1.5 million troops who served in Iraq or Afghanistan, 720,000 (48 percent) are now veterans in the civilian population. Of these, 202,000 have filed claims for VA disability benefits. The VA granted benefits in more than 90 percent of the cases processed so far, and will grant more upon appeal or presentation of additional evidence. In other words, real statistics show that one out of four veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan is disabled in military service. 
   Congress responded by passing a funding bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs that would provide $43.1 billion in discretionary spending. This is the largest increase in veterans' benefits spending in the VA's 77-year history.
   ""This funding alone is not enough,"" Sanders said. ""We could have the best services in the world for our returning veterans but if they don't know about them or can't access them then they are not serving their purpose. That is what this program in Vermont is all about. What we are trying to do here is develop a model outreach program which connects service members and their families who need assistance to programs that can provide help.
   ""That may mean help with general health problems, mental health counseling, marriage counseling, financial problems, services for children and substance abuse awareness and treatment,"" he added. ""We are finding out that veterans and their families are in need of a wide variety of assistance when they get back. Some of that help can be found at the VA; National Guard Family Assistance Centers; local and state social service programs, and charitable and non-profit organizations. The outreach specialists help connect and refer these service members and their families to whatever the most appropriate help is. What we are also doing here is leveraging the resources and expertise that the various entities in our state have. There is no need to reinvent the wheel here, but rather we need to connect those needing help with those that already provide it.
   ""We all know that service members and their families, especially those from the National Guard and Reserves, often are not aware of the services and benefits available to them or do not know how to access them. This program provides some of that education. This is also especially important for service members who live in rural areas like many parts of Vermont that may not be near an active duty base, VA facilities, or other avenues of assistance.
   ""This outreach also helps work around the reluctance some service members have in asking for help. By using other veterans to do the outreach, we tap into the fact that many service members are more comfortable talking to someone who shares their experiences. Additionally, certain health problems or needs for other assistance do not arise for months after our men and women in uniform return from deployment. These outreach programs, focused over a longer period of time, will allow service members to get help with the problems that surface down the road.
   ""So what we see here is that certain issues just are not going to come up right away. When people come back they are just happy to be home, see their family and friends. After some time passes, however, problems may boil to the surface. That is why it is very important that we have this kind of proactive outreach and follow up with these service members because they might not know what kind of help they are going to need right when they come back but after a few months the needs and the questions may be more clear.""

1081,December 14  2005 Senator Clinton Says Republican Budget Plan Fails to Keep Faith With the Priorities of the American People                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    In a speech on the Senate floor today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton took aim at the budget plan being debated by the Senate calling it   a fatally flawed plan that finances further irresponsible tax breaks on the backs of Americans who struggle to pay college tuition  provide health care coverage for their families and keep their homes warm this winter               This budget plan has been written in the full spirit of the   Grinch Who Stole Christmas     But instead of taking away the presents  the decorations and other vestiges of Christmas like the Grinch did  the Republican majority in Congress is instead ringing in the holiday season by taking away Medicaid benefits  food stamps  child support enforcement  child care programs and student loan benefits      Senator Clinton told her colleagues     But one of the big differences is that at the end of the story the Grinch sees the errors of his ways and had a change of heart  I can only hope that the members of this chamber experience a similar revelation              In detailing the devastating budget cuts  Senator Clinton noted the irony of the majority  s willingness to finance corporate tax breaks while taking a budget axe to programs critical to working families             Consider this  the  2 6 billion in new tax breaks for oil companies contained in the Energy Bill  one in a series of irresponsible corporate tax giveaways  would cover the health care costs of an additional 1 7 million kids nationwide     Senator Clinton said     The Republican majority is also proposing an approximately  700 million cut in food stamps   Simply reinstating the superfund polluter tax  which forces companies that pollute to bear the expense of clean up instead of average taxpayers  would alone generate  7 3 billion over the next ten years    more than ten times the cost of the food stamp cut               And if we simply took the  18 billion revenue raising package adopted by the Senate in its tax bill    which repeals  among other loopholes  another  4 3 billion tax giveaway to oil companies and cracks down on abusive corporate tax transactions  such as setting up offshore in tax havens like Bermuda to avoid paying U S  taxes    we would be able to avoid the painful increases in costs to students striving to better themselves through a college education     Clinton added    Instead  we are looking at the largest cut to aid in the history of the student loan program   An average student saddled with  17 500 in student loans would pay up to  5 800 in additional payments under the Republican plan   Approximately 472 000 New York students would see an increase in costs             Clinton concluded by stating    What the Republican majority has proposed is not what is best for America  because it undermines our long held tradition of supporting families by providing the tools they need to make American the best it can be   The economic policies of the majority and this Administration defy both arithmetic and reality   It  s time that we go back to a conservative fiscal policy that pays as you go  doesn  t spend what you don  t have  and produces balanced budgets and surpluses that will enable us to prepare for the future  And it  s time that we return to policies that truly value all American families                ,0

1860,"SEN. SANDERS OFFERS AMENDMENT TO COMBAT POVERTY IN AMERICA TO MINIMUM WAGE BILL
  Sen. Bernie Sanders today offered an amendment on the Senate floor to combat pervasive poverty in America as part of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007. The amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that we have a moral obligation to improve the lives of the nearly 37 million Americans living in poverty, eradicate childhood poverty, and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. A full copy of Senator Sanders' floor statement is attached.  
   Sanders said, ""Despite the fact that the United States is the richest country in the history of the world, nearly 13 percent of our citizens are living in poverty and we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country in the industrialized world. In my opinion we have a moral responsibility to end child poverty in this country and reduce the gap between the rich and the poor."" 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the childhood poverty rate is nearly 18%. The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent and the CEOs of our largest corporations now earn over 800 times what a minimum wage earner makes. Sanders' amendment would call on the President to submit a plan to Congress which eradicates childhood poverty over the next decade and reduces the gap between the rich and the poor. 
   Sanders said, ""We have got to come up with a plan to address persistent poverty in this country. Increasing the minimum wage is a great first step, but we have got to do more, and that is what this amendment is all about.""

1859,"DELEGATION ANNOUNCES $1.3 MILLION FOR VERMONT HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE
  U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Congressman Peter Welch today announced the release of $40 million in home heating assistance. 
   The latest round of emergency heating aid included $1.3 million for Vermont, where a new layer of snow was falling and the low temperature tonight was predicted to be around 17 degrees in Burlington.  
   The White House is still sitting on another $120 million in emergency funds that President Bush has not released to states during a cold winter when heating oil prices have soared to record highs around $3.40 a gallon.
   ""The good news is that help paying home heating bills is going to states like Vermont where the need is greatest,"" Sanders said.  ""I strongly encourage the White House to release the remaining funds because the high price of home heating fuel is stretching the budgets of seniors on fixed incomes, families with children and people with disabilities."" 
   ""It is a good thing that this help is on the way to families across the state that are feeling the pressure of high heating costs,"" Leahy said.  ""But the need is great, and I urge the administration to release the additional $120 million that Congress has made available.  No family should be forced to choose between heating bills and putting food on the table.""
   Welch said, ""The continued high cost of heating fuel is crippling Vermonters' already tight budgets and threatens the well-being of many of our neighbors struggling to get by.  This release is welcome news, but with oil at record high prices again this week, we need energy policies that will bring the excessive cost of fuel under control.""
   The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program provides critical help to 5.8 million senior citizens on fixed incomes and low-income families with children, including approximately 20,000 households in Vermont.

Clinton  D NY  today to urge the Department of Veterans Affairs to keep comprehensive medical services at the Montrose VA Campus and to consider local proposals for the site    James Nicholson  the departing Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  is expected to rule on a plan for the V A  Hudson Valley Health Care System  which includes the Montrose Campus  before he leaves on October 1st   Changes being considered as part of the VAs ongoing Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  process involve potentially moving the domiciliary services currently provided at the Montrose site to the facility in Castle Point    As you review the options for the Montrose campus  we want to strongly emphasize our desire to see it remain dedicated to serving the needs of local veterans  the New York legislators wrote in a letter to Nicholson   We are therefore strongly urging that your final decision ensure the provision of comprehensive medical services at the Montrose VA site    The lawmakers expressed concern that a study used by the V A  to determine the future of Montrose does not adequately reflect the increasing number of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and their likely needs    As the number of wounded warriors returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continues to increase  services need to be added to the Montrose campus instead of taken away  said Hall  who is Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs   Montrose needs to be a world class health care facility for our veterans    The Montrose VA campus is critical to serving the needs of veterans in the Hudson Valley  said Lowey   The facilities and land must remain dedicated to serving the needs of local veterans if we are to care properly for those who have served this nation    Engel said  It is essential that we keep our promises to our veterans  promises made for their service to our country  It is not only enough to have help available for them  but it must also be close enough so they can take advantage of it  Sadly  the increasing number of wounded veterans coming from Iraq and Afghanistan make this facility even more necessity that it had been  We must make the Montrose facility all it can be    I have had the honor of standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans at Montrose to fight against the closings and cuts proposed under the CARES process  Now  as we come to this critical point in the process we should not forget that these decisions will directly affect our veterans in the Hudson Valley for many years to come  That is why it is essential that any decision made reflects an understanding of the long term needs of our veterans  including those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan now and in the future  said Senator Clinton  I urge the Secretary to consider the very real impact of the available options  and to do what is best for our veterans by choosing to allow Montrose to remain dedicated to serving those who have so bravely served our country    Its critical that we maintain vital medical services at the Montrose campus  said Senator Schumer  We should be fighting tooth and nail to preserve the Montrose campus as a top notch facility where veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan can receive world class medical treatment  As the Secretary considers proposals for the future of the campus he needs to remember the priority is servicing our vets  We cannot accept anything less    Westchester County Executive Andy Spano and Cortlandt Town Supervisor Linda Puglisi recently submitted a proposal for areas designated for reuse at the Montrose campus  which the lawmakers asked Nicholson for a full and fair evaluation of   They also requested that any decision made by Nicholson not preclude Westchester County  the Town of Cortlandt  and other regional stakeholders  from developing the Montrose campus for targeted veterans use until the Department has had an opportunity to hear and consider their proposal    A copy of the letter is below    September 14  2007   The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  NW   Washington  DC 20420   Dear Secretary Nicholson    We have monitored the CARES process regarding the VA Hudson Valley Health Care System with great interest and have actively participated in the Local Advisory Panel meetings held by the VA   As you review the options for the Montrose campus  we want to strongly emphasize our desire to see it remain dedicated to serving the needs of local veterans   We are therefore strongly urging that your final decision ensure the provision of comprehensive medical services at the Montrose VA site     With the commencement of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom  the number of combat veterans is increasing   Advances in medical technology have resulted in fewer deaths  but a much higher rate of servicemembers returning with serious injuries  both physical and psychological  that will require life long care   We are concerned that the VAs projections for veterans needs in the Hudson Valley do not adequately reflect both the increasing number of veterans of Iraq  Afghanistan and potential future conflicts and their likely needs   It is important that any decision made regarding the future of Montrose be grounded in a comprehensive and accurate projection of the number of veterans who could rely on this facility in the years ahead    The Montrose campus affords an opportunity to look broadly at the needs of our veterans   The enhanced use leasing of the Montrose campus mandated by CARES will have a significant impact on this regions veterans and the communities surrounding Montrose   Westchester County Executive Andy Spano and Cortlandt Town Supervisor Linda Puglisi recently presented to us a proposal for areas designated for reuse at the Montrose campus   We ask that you meet with them to give their proposal a full and fair evaluation   Further  we ask that no decision be made that would preclude Westchester County  the Town of Cortlandt  and other regional stakeholders  from developing the Montrose campus for targeted veterans use until the Department has had an opportunity to hear and consider their proposal       In closing  we again express our strong belief that the Montrose campus should remain dedicated to meeting the needs of local veterans   The CARES process should provide world class healthcare to our veterans and any future development of the facilities at Montrose should first and foremost be geared to serving their needs and honoring their service to our nation     Thank you for your consideration   John Hall  Member of Congress Elliot Engel  Member

1973,"SEN. SANDERS JOINING CELEBRATION OF HEALTHY EATING AND SMALL FAMILY FARMS IN BARRE
  The summer salad greens are crisp. The rhubarb is red. This season's first strawberries and fresh green spinach from Vermont farms are out of the fields and into the market bins. Vermont artisanal cheeses and our famous cheddars are on display. Markets that connect Vermont farmers with Vermont families are an important part of our way of life. A new Vermont Fresh Market - specializing in produce, dairy and meat from Vermont farms - opens this weekend in Barre, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is joining the celebration of healthy eating and small family farms. 
   ""Preserving family farms makes sense from an economic standpoint, from an environmental standpoint, from a food safety and nutrition standpoint, and from a national security standpoint,"" he said.
   In Barre, Ariel Zevon converted a vacant building that used to house a department store into a market and caf? specializing in Vermont-grown produce and supplies. Markets in towns and cities all over the state also supply shoppers with fresh, healthy, home-grown Vermont farm products.
   Meanwhile, Sanders is working in Congress to rewrite a farm bill to encourage access to healthy fruits and vegetables. He joined other senators in urging the Agriculture Committee to increase support for farmers' markets, let schools request local food for their lunch and breakfast programs; and protect farmland from encroachment by sprawling cities and suburbs.

1837,"NOT RICHISTAN
  Judy Daloz is the nurse at St. Johnsbury Elementary School. Every day she sees children who show up for school hungry. She knows parents who dread eye exams because they cannot afford to take their kids to see eye doctors, let alone buy them glasses. She knows some families have trouble scraping together the $15 fee for a birth certificate needed to enroll each of their children in the Dr. Dynassaur program. Nurse Daloz talked about her experiences at a town meeting on poverty that Senator Bernie Sanders held earlier this month in the Northeast Kingdom. Other panelists described similar realties, including how more and more Vermonters need to use food shelves in order to survive. This is not Richistan.  
   ""There is something very wrong in our country when poverty is increasing and the middle class is shrinking at exactly the same time as the wealthiest people are becoming much wealthier. That growing economic divide is not what America is supposed to be about,"" Sanders said.
   ""It's not just the Northeast Kingdom,"" he added. ""Recently, I met with a group of young people in Burlington, mostly college graduates in their twenties. They spoke about how they're struggling to pay off college loans, secure decent health insurance and find affordable housing on wages that are just not doing the trick.
   Despite what we're hearing from the Bush administration, the truth is that the economy is not doing well for the middle class and working families of Vermont or the rest of the country. Sometimes it seems like Bush is the president of Richistan. 
   Richistan is not really a place. It's the name of a book by Robert Frank, a Wall Street Journal reporter. He writes about the world of the super rich and how much they spend on fancy watches and jewelry and - to relieve the pressure from all the tough choices they must make about where to spend their millions - on spas. 
   Frank wrote on his blog that ""the title comes from a chance meeting I had a few years ago at a yacht show in Florida. I was walking along the docks, marveling at hundreds of giant boats parked in the marina. I had seen plenty of yachts before, but never so many at once. I got to talking with a yacht owner from Texas, and as he looked out over the boats he said: 'You look at all these boats and you'd think everyone was making loads of money. It's like it's a different country.'
   ""The words stuck with me. The wealthy weren't just getting wealthier -- they were forming their own virtual country. They were wealthier than most nations, with the top 1 percent controlling $17 trillion in wealth. And they were increasingly building a self-contained world, with its own health-care system (concierge doctors), travel system (private jets, destination clubs) and language. (""Who's your household manager?"") They had created their own breakaway republic -- one I called Richistan.""

1467,July 18  2007 Senator Clinton Speaks on the Senate Floor on Higher Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered remarks on higher education on the floor of the Senate today as the debate begins about the Higher Education Reconciliation Bill of which Senator Clinton is a co sponsor      A transcript of Senator Clintons remarks is below      I am delighted to come to the floor and talk about this extremely important piece of legislation   And I thank our leader and a great advocate on behalf of education  the Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  Senator Kennedy      This bill really represents a tremendous victory for students  for their families  for higher education  for the future of the American economy  for millions of families who still struggle to pay for college and for millions of young people who will not only carry forth from their education a degree  but on average  more student debt than any graduates who came before them     Most of all  this bill is a victory for that young boy or girl who is thriving in school  who might one day wish to attend college and fulfill his or her God given potential  but worries that such a wish is beyond his or her reach  that it s just too expensive to realize     I want to commend the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle for the great work that has been done bringing this bill to the floor  I was thrilled with many of the provisions  some of which I ve worked on ever since I came to the Senate  particularly focusing on nontraditional students who more and more are becoming the norm  older students  married students  single parent students  who often have found that there were barriers to their accessing whatever help was available from the federal government programs to continue their education     I m also personally just thrilled at what we ve done for homeless and foster youth   This has been a passion of mine going back to my years as a law student when I first started representing abused and neglected children   children who ended up in the foster care system  all the way through my time in the White House  where we were instrumental in working with the Congress in passing landmark legislation to make adoption easier  to try to make the foster care system more responsive to the needs of the child and to accelerate decisions being made as to whether or not a child would ever realistically be able to return to his or her biological family   to my years in the Senate  where we have continued to try to help students who are in the foster care system as they age out      As Senator Murray pointed out  when you turn 18 or graduate from high school  whichever comes first  still in many states in our country  you are no longer eligible for the foster care system   And what that has meant is that a social worker usually shows up at the foster home with a big black garbage bag and tells the young man or woman to put his or her belongings into that bag because they are no longer able to live in a foster home with state support      For many young people whom I ve been privileged to know  some of whom have interned for me  have worked for me in my office here or in my office in the White House  they were the lucky ones   You know  they had the right combination of personal resilience and ability combined with mentoring and some breaks along the way that enabled them to complete high school and often go to college at great cost   Many of them had nowhere to go during summer vacations or Thanksgiving or Christmas or any other break in the academic schedule   Some of them hid themselves in the dorm   Some of them stayed in bus stations or airports   Some of them prevailed upon a friendly professor or fellow student to take them in   So by recognizing the special needs of these special students  we really do a very important piece of legislative business that has a big heart in it   And I thank my colleagues who worked with me and others to make this happen     When we think about the importance of college  it s hard to really grasp the fact that most young people in our country will not go to college and graduate   The college going rate has been pretty stagnant now for about 20  30 years   And as the cost of higher education has gone up  it s become even more difficult for young people to work their way through to afford the increases in tuition  room  and board   But the investment in college still remains a very good one   Each additional year of education after high school increases an individual s income by 5 to 15 percent   A college degree will enable an individual to earn close to  1 million more in the course of a life s work than those who have only a high school diploma   It is no coincidence that the rise of the American middle class coincided with the explosion of college attendance  It unlocks economic potential and it gives students access to the American dream  to a career and a life that they then can build      But  as I say  unfortunately in the past 25 years  the cost of college has risen faster than inflation   College costs have tripled over the past 20 years  and as the costs spiral upward  so does the size of the loans and the loan payments that are necessary   Students who borrow take out loans averaging  15 500 while attending public colleges and universities and almost  20 000 while attending private schools  twice what they would have borrowed just ten years ago   At New York University in Manhattan  60 percent of students graduate owing an average of  27 639   At Idaho State University  69 percent of students graduate owing an average of  29 467   And at the University of Miami in Florida  whose President served with such distinction in this town as the Secretary of Health and Human Services for eight years  58 percent of the students graduate owing an average of  31 723      Now  this debt limits students  options and damages their financial futures   It really is a chain around their ankles as they end their education and go out into the world of work   With this reconciliation bill  we are cutting that chain   This bill will provide  17 3 billion in student aid  the largest increase in student aid in more than a decade   And it will provide this aid without raising federal taxes one dime      First  the Higher Education Reconciliation Bill increases the purchasing power of the Pell Grant  which helps the lowest income students offset the cost of college   It s no secret to anyone in this chamber the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has declined dramatically from nearly 60 percent of the cost of a public school 20 years ago to only 36 percent today   This legislation provides the largest Pell Grant increase in more then a decade  increasing the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 immediately and to  5 400 by 2011     Now take my state  for example   This initial boost will provide over  200 million in increased grant aid to New York students for the 2007 2008 school year alone and  1 7 billion by 2013    The legislation also raises the income cut off for Pell Grants from  20 000 to  30 000  making many more students from many more families eligible to receive a Pell Grant     Second  I m very pleased that the Higher Education Reconciliation Act tackles an issue addressed in legislation I sponsored in the last Congress  called the Student Borrowers Bill of Rights   It provides protections for student borrowers while they repay their loans   It does so by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of the borrowers discretionary income and providing several important protections to members of the armed forces and public service employees during repayment   This is critical to helping students manage their debt especially in the first few years after they graduate     Third  I am pleased that the reconciliation bill also creates a new loan forgiveness plan through the direct loan program for public service employees      I hear from many students in New York and around the country who would love to be teachers or police officers or firefighters or nurses or social workers or public defenders  but sadly they are so saddled with debt that such careers in the public arena seem like an impossibility for them  That is the wrong policy   We want to encourage more young people to go into public service   Our policies should respect that choice  not denigrate it     Under the Loan Forgiveness Program the remaining loan balance on a loan is forgiven for a borrower who has been employed in a public sector job and making payments on the loan for 10 years   These jobs are essential to the communities they serve and I believe this program will encourage public service and provide an incentive for borrowers to pursue low paying  perhaps  but vital professions to our country      Mr  President  when I was getting ready to go to college many years ago  my father who was a small businessman    a very small business    said that he had saved enough money for me to go to college and he could pay tuition  room  and board  but if I wanted to buy a book I had to earn the money   And that was fine because I had worked ever since I was 13 in the summer and during vacations  So I worked my way through college with my family s help and when I graduated I decided I wanted to go to law school   I told my father that and he said that is not part of the bargain   If you want to go to law school you have to pay for it yourself   So I got a little scholarship and I continued to work year round and I borrowed money directly from the federal government  the National Defense Education Act  something which many of us in this chamber took advantage of when we were pursuing our education   And the interest rate was very low   The repayment schedule was something I could handle   I didn t have to worry about anyone raising the rate on me or changing the terms on me   I just worked  first  for the Children s Defense Fund as a young lawyer  and then in public service here in Washington  working for the Congress  and then teaching law at the University of Arkansas and running a legal aid clinic   And during all those years when I was doing public service and academic work I could handle what my repayment obligations were     I want that available for young people today   I think it s important  especially as we look at what s happening in government service and other public service professions to see how there is an aging that is going to eventually result in the loss of a lot of very experienced people     I spent Monday at Binghamton University in New York  where we have the only PhD program in rural nursing   And I met with the nursing faculty and some of the nursing students   And it s a wonderful program  but the average age of a nurse in America is over 45   And the average age of a nursing faculty member is 54     And we have many  many people who want to go to nursing school who don t have places for them even though they re qualified and we have a lot of others who worry about how they can pay for their education   And you can replicate that across every single profession that really falls into the service professions  the caring professions that we are seeing shortages of people going into because there s a disconnect between the salary that they are paid and the debt they have to incur in order to get the credential to be able to perform the public service     So I believe in the long run this increase in student aid will pay for itself  Not only do college graduates earn more and therefore are able to pay back to society  but they are less likely to draw on public resources and they re much more likely to really make a contribution     This bill has had great bipartisan support and I m very proud to have worked on it and to see the positive changes that it includes   Clearly  this is something that I hope we will be able to pass by acclamation  Mr  President   I hope that after the difficulties and the debate and the disagreements of the last week over the very difficult issue of Iraq  I hope we come together around a fundamental American value  namely education     We have the best higher education system in the world  it is a system filled with second chances for people who decide at the age of 18 or 80 that they want to pursue an education at a community college or a technical college or a four year college or a university   This is one of the really important aspects of American society and it s instrumental to the further development of our economy and the hope of a return to shared prosperity for our people     Mr  President  I highly urge that all of our colleagues come together to support this Higher Education Reconciliation Bill to make higher education more affordable   It is good social policy   It is good economic policy   It is certainly good budgetary policy  and it makes a big difference to

1043,October 13  2006 Senator Clinton Visits Cathedral Candle Company in Syracuse to Celebrate Recent Victory for U S  Candle Makers Over Unfair Trade Practices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Clinton was Part of Congressional Delegation that Fought Against Candle Imports Unfairly Circumventing U S  Trade Laws                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Syracuse  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton visited the Cathedral Candle Company to celebrate a home grown industry that that has a proud history in Syracuse and a recent victory over the unfair trade practices that threatened this industry  s welfare  Senator Clinton  who toured the factory and spoke to workers during her visit  was a key member of the Congressional Delegation that had been fighting actions by candle producers and importers from China who were unfairly circumventing U S  trade laws            This company is really a great example of a tradition of commitment to local roots  the local economy and the local community   But that tradition has been under threat for some time now from overseas producers and importers who have been unfairly circumventing our trade laws     Senator Clinton said    Manufacturers like Cathedral Candle Company deserve a level playing field and we owe it to them to make sure that others can not get away with unfair trade practices               I am pleased that the Department of Commerce heeded our call to take action and recognized the importance of this decision to local producers and I am pleased that I can be here today to celebrate this victory for the Syracuse candle making industry     Senator Clinton said    I hope that we can continue this proud candle making heritage  right here in Syracuse  for generations to come             According to the National Candle Association  the Chinese candle producers and U S  importers have engaged in widespread and aggressive efforts to circumvent the Antidumping Duty Order on petroleum wax candles from China   Since 1998  the wide spread efforts by China producers and U S  importers have more than tripled the import of Chinese candles that should be subject to the Antidumping Duty Order  based on their composition          Last year  Senator Clinton joined her Congressional Colleagues in support of a National Candle Association petition alleging that candles imported from China were avoiding a 108 3  antidumping duty rate imposed on petroleum wax candles by the Department of Commerce  because they claimed to be primarily composed of palm and vegetable based wax  when the primary ingredient was petroleum wax          Knowing that continued circumvention of the Antidumping Duty Order would cause irreparable harm to these companies and to domestic candle producers in general  and in support of companies like Cathedral Candle Company and others in Syracuse  Senator Clinton and her colleagues urged the U S  Department of Commerce to take immediate action on the allegations          Just last week their efforts were rewarded with a decision by the U S  Department of Commerce to require Chinese candle producers to comply with the Antidumping Duty Order on their mixed wax imported candles and pay a 108 3  duty on those imports  The Department of Commerce  s final determination effectively orders a 108 3  duty margin on mixed wax candles that contain up to 87 80  of palm and or other vegetable oil based waxes  The 108 3  duty will be retroactive to February 25  2005  which was when the investigation commenced          Cathedral Candle Company  opened in 1897  is owned and operated by the fourth generation of Steigerwalds  Cathedral still makes only church candles  The original factory  on Kirkpatrick Street in Syracuse  remains the core of today s expanded manufacturing facility  Assembly lines of molds  presses  and inventive automation devices built to Jacob Steigerwald  s specifications still operate there today  along side modern state of the art candle manufacturing equipment built to Cathedral  s specifications          ,0

257,   Obama Joins Levin and Coleman to Introduce Bill to Stop Misuse of U S  Companies   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Levin and Coleman to Introduce Bill to Stop Misuse of U S  Companies Thursday  May  1  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                          Contacts  Tara Andringa  Levin   LeRoy Coleman  Coleman   or Michael Ortiz  Obama   WASHINGTON   Today Senator Carl Levin  D Mich    Senator Norm Coleman  R Minn    and Senator Barack Obama  D Ill    Chairman  Ranking Minority Member  and Member of the U S  Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  introduced the Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act to help law enforcement stop the misuse of U S  corporations  Currently  nearly two million corporations and limited liability companies  LLCs  are formed within the United States each year   The States generally form these corporations without asking for the identity of the corporation s beneficial owners  and numerous law enforcement problems have resulted when some of these corporations have become involved with money laundering  tax evasion  or other misconduct   The bill being introduced would require the States to obtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations formed under their laws and to provide access to this information to law enforcement upon receipt of a subpoena or summons    Criminals are hiding behind U S  corporations while committing all sorts of crimes   from terrorism to money laundering  fraud  and tax evasion   said Levin    Law enforcement has told us for years that they need the names of the true owners behind a corporation to find out who is responsible for the illicit activity  but they can t get it  because the States don t bother to ask   The bill we are introducing today will strike a blow against corporate secrecy  strengthen law enforcement  and curb the misuse of U S  corporations       Criminal activities that exploit the lack of transparency in U S  corporation registrations are more costly than ever   said Coleman   As our work on the Subcommittee has shown again and again  law enforcement has been frustrated by the ability of money launderers and tax cheats to hide behind privately held corporations and LLCs   This bill will shed light on these illegal activities  in a fair and reasonable manner that does not burden the states with an unfunded mandate and protects individual privacy     It is unacceptable for American companies to be used by criminals and terrorists as shields for tax evasion  terror financing  and financial crimes   said Obama    We must ensure our law enforcement agencies have the ability to properly investigate any financial criminal wrongdoing   This important legislation promotes transparency  fairness  and public safety  and sheds light on the people behind corporate entities so that criminal and terrorist activities can be deterred or detected more effectively   The Subcommittee has been pursuing this issue since 2000  when Levin requested the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct an investigation into an individual who set up over 2 000 Delaware shell companies and then established bank accounts for those companies  without revealing their identities  moving  1 4 billion dollars through the bank accounts   In April 2006  the GAO prepared another report in response to a Levin Coleman request entitled   Company Formations  Minimal Ownership Information Is Collected and Available    This GAO report reviewed the legal requirements in all 50 states to set up corporations and LLCs  found that most states failed to request beneficial ownership information  and reported that the absence of this ownership information impeded law enforcement investigations of suspect corporations  In November 2006  the Subcommittee held a hearing in which the GAO report was released  and officials from the Department of Justice  DOJ   the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   and the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  FinCEN  testified about an increase in the use of U S  shell companies for illicit activities  and the problems caused by the lack of beneficial ownership information   The Subcommittee has collected numerous examples of these law enforcement problems  including the following  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  reported that a Nevada based corporation received more than 3 700 suspicious wire transfers totaling  81 million over 2 years   The case was not prosecuted  however  because ICE was unable to identify the corporation s owners     FinCEN found that  between April 1996 and January 2004  financial institutions filed 397 suspicious activity reports  involving a total of almost  4 billion  U S  shell companies  East European countries  and U S  bank accounts      The Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  reported that U S  shell companies are being used to launder as much as  36 billion from the former Soviet Union   The FBI also reported that they have 103 open cases investigating market manipulation  most of which involve U S  shell companies      The IRS described a scheme involving three individuals who set up U S  shell companies to conceal nearly  9 million in taxable income in secret accounts in the Turks and Caicos Islands and other foreign countries      DOJ reported that Russian officials used shell companies in Pennsylvania and Delaware to unlawfully divert  15 million in international aid intended to upgrade the safety of former Soviet nuclear power plants      On April 22  2008  in response to a written question by Senator Levin  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff wrote    In countless investigations  where the criminal targets utilize shell corporations  the lack of law enforcement s ability to gain access to true beneficial ownership information slows  confuses or impedes the efforts by investigators to follow criminal proceeds       In July 2006  the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering  which is the leading international organization combating money laundering  issued a report criticizing the United States for failing to comply with a FATF standard requiring beneficial ownership information to be obtained and urging the United States to correct this deficiency by July 2008    In response  the United States has repeatedly urged the States to strengthen their incorporation practices by obtaining beneficial ownership information for the corporations and LLCs formed under their laws   The States  however  have not changed their incorporation practices    U S  corporations are getting a bad name  not only because they are being used to commit crimes  but because U S  law enforcement can t find out who owns them   said Levin    Right now  a person forming a U S  corporation typically provides less information to a State than is needed to obtain a bank account or driver s license   That doesn t make sense  and it invites misuse of U S  corporations   It s time for the United States to meet its international anti money laundering commitments  and that means getting beneficial ownership information for U S  corporations   All 27 countries in the European Union are already required to obtain beneficial ownership information for the corporations they form                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1

292,   Obama to Propose Aid for Katrina Children   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama to Propose Aid for Katrina Children Thursday  February  2  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 2  2006  Obama to Propose Aid for Katrina Children   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Thursday introduced legislation to help low income children from Hurricane Katrina affected areas by temporarily extending the Child Tax Credit to low income parents in counties affected by the storm    The legislation was introduced as an amendment to a  70 billion tax cut bill    This achieves two goals  First  it helps keep a promise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   Obama said   Second  in a  70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy and well connected  it sets aside less than 1 percent for our neediest children     On September 15  2005  President Bush stood in the ruins of New Orleans and vowed to  do what it takes  to help the region recover  He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said   We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action    Five months later  the President has not followed through with bold actions  while the neediest families struggled to put their lives back together    This uses a cost effective and proven tool in our tax code  the Child Tax Credit  to extend aid to low income working families affected by Hurricane Katrina   Obama said     Since it was established in 1997  the Child Tax Credit has helped millions of parents with tax credits of up to  1 000 a year per child  However  the benefit is currently skewed so that many families who need it the most cannot get it  Because the credit does not begin to go into effect until a parent makes at least  11 000 a year  someone who works full time at minimum wage is ineligible to receive any of the credit  Millions more low income families can only receive a partial credit   Across the country  17 million chilX Eon Dm  dm31 Return Path  in Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama did not receive the full credit    Senator Obama s amendment would temporarily extend the Child Tax Credit for parents in counties declared disaster areas in the storm   It would allow these parents to begin receiving the credit with the first dollar of earned income  instead of the current  11 000 floor   A parent who earns  10 000 a year  the equivalent of full time employment at minimum wage  would receive the entire  1 000 credit    We should send a simple message  if you work  your kids get a benefit   Obama said   That s a common sense way to support families with children  especially families that have experienced the devastation of a natural disaster      The amendment is narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible   It is aimed at families affected by the Hurricanes  and it provides short term support  expiring in 2008   Costs are offset by not extending the tax breaks on the investment income of people who earn more than  100 million a year    Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama  Hurricane Katrina Child Assistance Amendment  Senate Floor  February 1  2006   Mr  President  I rise to speak about an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill that I intend to offer at the appropriate time     The Amendment achieves two goals   First  it helps keep a promise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   Second  in a  70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy and well connected  it sets aside less than 1 percent for the neediest in our society    Two weeks after Katrina made landfall  President Bush stood in the ruins of New Orleans and vowed to  do what it takes  to help the region recover  He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said   We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action    Five months later  the President s timid actions have not matched his bold rhetoric   He has not lived up to his promises    My amendment uses a cost effective and proven tool in our tax code  the Child Tax Credit  to extend aid to low income working families affected by Hurricane Katrina     Enacted in 1997  the Child Credit allows families with qualifying children to receive a credit of  1 000 per child against their federal income tax   Unfortunately  the credit is skewed so that many families who need it the most can t get it     Under current law  families that earn less than  11 000 get no benefit from the refundable child credit   That means that a child is left out of the credit even if her parent works full time at minimum wage  which has not increased since 1997   And the child doesn t get the full benefit of the  1000 credit until her parent earns close to  18 000  or even more if the child has siblings       What s worse  if her parents  incomes stagnate  are disrupted for any reason  or the economy stalls and work hours or wages are reduced  the value of the credit drops or even disappears   Under current law  almost 17 million children get less than the full credit     We all know what happened to the families on the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Katrina  and it will be a long time before these families can rebuild their lives    Many of the families in the affected states were evacuated to other areas  and many of them cannot even afford to go back   And the federal response so far has been inadequate to get these families effectively back on their feet     We need to do better  At a time when we are debating  70 billion of tax breaks  many of which will benefit those who need the least help  it is critical that we remember the worst off and the most vulnerable members of our society    When I went to Houston after the Hurricane  I met an evacuee from New Orleans who said to me   we had nothing before the hurricane  and now we ve got less than nothing    Life was hard for many families even before Katrina hit   In Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama  for example  more than 900 000 children under 17 years old were so poor that they got no child tax credit or only a partial credit   These states had among the highest rates of children too poor to get the full credit   In fact  more than 1 3 of the children in Mississippi and Louisiana didn t get the full benefit of the child tax credit     This amendment  at a cost of less than 1 percent of the overall Tax Reconciliation bill  will provide necessary assistance to many of these families   The amendment eliminates the income threshold that excluded all children in families with less than  11 000 of income     My amendment sends a simple message  if you work  your kids get a benefit   It provides a partial credit starting with the first dollar of a parent s income for families who lived in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina       The amendment is simple   it says that the children of low income working parents affected by Hurricane Katrina will no longer be denied the child credit   You work  your kids get a benefit   If you don t work  no benefit   And if you want the full benefit  you have to earn at least  10 000  which is just about the income of a full time job at minimum wage     That s a common sense way to support families with children  especially families that have experienced the huge cost   psychological and financial   of a natural disaster     My amendment is also narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible   It is aimed at families affected by the Hurricanes  and it provides short term support  expiring in 2008    With this amendment  hundreds of thousands of this country s most disadvantaged children will see an increase in their credit

817,May 11  2005 Senator Clinton Urges Department of Veterans   Affairs to Reconsider Transfer of Services from Montrose

                 Transfer of Psychiatric and Long Term Care Inpatient Services from Montrose to Castle Point Could Undermine Care for Area Veterans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Senator Clinton today urged the Department of Veterans   Affairs to rethink the ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care inpatient services from the Montrose VA hospital to the Castle Point facility   Senator Clinton underscored her long standing opposition to consolidating the facilities in testimony conducted by telephone today for a Local Advisory Panel hearing held as part of the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  project          I oppose the VA  s ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care in patient services from the Montrose campus to the Castle Point campus   At this time  when we are seeing so many sacrifices  injuries and difficulties by our brave troops serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  I think it sends the wrong message to propose drastic changes in veterans   health care               Senator Clinton noted that her office had received information indicating there are still substantial waiting periods for certain services that veterans living in this region experience at VA Hudson Valley Health Care System facilities   This underlines the strain the system is experiencing and underscores the need for additional analysis before closing these in patient services at Montrose and shifting additional patient care to Castle Point          I hear from many of our veterans about significant delays in getting services at our already overstressed facilities and I don  t believe that we are prepared to make these changes without additional analysis             Senator Clinton underscored the importance of ensuring that VA s planning process for the Montrose and Castle Point VA hospitals is fully transparent   As a result of the Clinton Enzi CARES amendment  the Consolidated Appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2004 expressed concern that the recommendations of the CARES commission may lead to a reduction in long term care  domiciliary care and mental health services   The VA was expected to expedite the strategic planning process for these services  and Congress urged that no closures or reduction in these services take place until the full analysis was completed   However  the VA is moving forward with plans to shift inpatient mental health and long term care services from Montrose to Castle Point  apparently without having completed the strategic planning process for mental health care and long term care  or without having released the plans to the public if they have been completed        Senator Clinton also urged that the transportation challenges faced by seniors and disabled veterans in the Hudson Valley take a prominent role in the CARES deliberations   Many who rely on the Montrose VA for services could have great difficulty making the trip to the Castle Point VA            I urge the panel to take into account all of these factors and listen to the voices of New York veterans           Senator Clinton has fought for New York s veterans throughout the CARES process  Last month  Senator Clinton met with VA Secretary Nicholson to reiterate her serious concerns regarding the VA CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study yet more changes in New York s VA facilities  Secretary Nicholson agreed to consider the points she raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Montrose and Castle Point VAs         Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York s veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care and to keep New York VA hospitals open                   A copy of Senator Clinton  s testimony submitted to the hearing is attached       Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton   Before the Local Advisory Panel of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project   May 11  2005  Montrose  New York    Introduction    Distinguished members of the Panel  let me thank you for allowing me to present testimony on the consequences the Department of Veterans Affairs Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project  CARES  would have on the veterans of New York and the people who serve their needs at these institutions   As I will explain more fully below  I oppose the VA  s ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care inpatient services from the Montrose campus to the Castle Point campus        At this time in our nation  s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation  Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care        As a starting point  our bottom line goal should be the delivery of high quality health care services to our veterans  delivered as efficiently as possible  Veterans   health care is too important an issue to require an adherence to artificial deadlines and hasty recommendations   With literally the lives of veterans at stake  the panel should not engage in a rush to judgment over closing or reducing services at VA facilities and should not elevate financial considerations over the needs of our veterans       Listening to Veterans    On April 19th  I met with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson and handed him a letter in which I reiterated my serious concerns regarding the VA  s CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study further changes in New York  s VA facilities   He agreed to consider the serious concerns I raised regarding the Montrose and Castle Point VA  s        I must underline at the outset how absolutely essential it is that during this next phase in the process  the VA s planning process for the Montrose and Castle Point VA s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process  It is the veterans who must remain at the center of this process   I cannot stress strongly enough how essential it is that full community involvement be central to the process from beginning to end  With the full involvement of the community in these decisions  the VA will help to maximize the possibility that that our veterans will get the highest quality health care they deserve       VA CARES Process    There have been several stages to the CARES process  which in my view has been a rushed process that did not adequately heed the voices of New York  s veterans   The Draft National CARES Plan recommended eliminating all inpatient services at Montrose VA hospital and transferring inpatient beds to Castle Point   I strongly opposed that plan        The CARES Commission recommended that inpatient psychiatric and nursing home beds be moved from Montrose to Castle Point  but that domiciliary based residential rehabilitation programs and ambulatory care services stay at Montrose        Former VA Secretary Anthony Principi  s CARES Decision Document  VA Decision Document   issued in May 2004  directed VA to   transfer acute psychiatric  long term psychiatric  and nursing home beds from the Montrose to the Castle Point campus  To accomplish this consolidation  VA will augment the mission at the Castle Point campus with new construction and reduce the footprint on the Montrose campus through an enhanced use lease for assisted living and other compatible uses or divestiture of property     including a possible joint effort with the National Cemetery Administration   The Decision Document also states that by consolidation at Castle Point    VA can build one new state of the art and appropriately sized nursing home    and   develop plans for the size of the new nursing home using its long term care and mental health strategic plans      At the Montrose campus    VA will continue to provide outpatient  domiciliary  and residential rehabilitation services                Proposed Consolidation of Services between Montrose and Castle Point VA  s    I have long opposed ill considered proposals to move inpatient psychiatric and long term care beds from Montrose to Castle Point  and have maintained that a decision to follow through on this recommendation would be a serious blow to veterans who currently rely on the Montrose VA hospital for their care         The Decisions Document explicitly calls for the development of plans for a new nursing home using   its long term care and mental health strategic plans      Unfortunately  it appears the VA has either not yet completed its strategic planning process for long term care and mental health care  or  if either plan has finally been completed  VA has failed to release it to the public        In the absence of strategic plans  proceeding with these changes at New York s facilities calls into question the VA s commitment to follow congressionally expressed intent regarding CARES  As the result of the introduction of the Clinton Enzi CARES amendment to the Fiscal Year 2004 Senate VA HUD appropriations bill  the House Senate conferees specifically stated in the Fiscal Year 2004 Consolidated Appropriations conference report that they  are concerned that the realignment recommendations of the CARES Commission may lead to a reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services  The VA is expected to expedite the strategic planning process for these services  Based on the Secretary s statements the conferees urge that no closures or reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services  will take place until the full analysis is completed   In addition  in November 2003  former Secretary Principi pledged  no net reduction in VA s capacity to provide inpatient mental health and long term care prior to completion of a comprehensive assessment of veterans  need for these services         Moreover  moving inpatient services from Montrose to Castle Point will no doubt require substantial sums of federal funding   My office is not aware of any analysis showing how veterans will get services if future budgets do not include enough funds for the transition        Moreover  the challenges of travel faced by seniors and disabled veterans in the Hudson Valley should take a prominent role in your deliberations   Many who rely on the Montrose VA could find it extremely difficult to make the trip to the Castle Point VA         In light of these concerns and the failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to issue its strategic planning for mental health and psychiatric care  the Montrose closure should be reconsidered   According to information provided to my office by the VA Hudson Valley Health Care System  there are still substantial waiting periods for certain services that veterans living in this region experience at VA Hudson Valley Health Care System facilities  This underlines the strain the system is experiencing   Clearly  additional analysis is necessary before closing in patient services at Montrose and shifting additional patient care to Castle Point       Conclusion     In meeting with veterans and hearing the comments that veterans and other stakeholders have provided to my office  I have learned a tremendous amount about the value of these facilities and the quality of health care that is delivered there   Our nation  s veterans have served their country with distinction   Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces    a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system   Yet the VA  s ill considered decision to consolidate the Montrose and Castle Point VA  s threatens to undermine our commitment to our nation  s veterans   I urge the Panel to take into account the proper factors and input from veterans  I believe that if you listen to the voices of New York  s veterans  you will make the right decisions for our veterans        Thank you                 ,0
1955,"GLOBAL WARMING BILL ADVANCES TO FULL SENATE
  For the first time, a bill calling for mandatory limits on greenhouse gases was approved by a Senate panel. The Environment and Public Works Committee voted 11 to 8 for legislation to cap emissions of heat trapping gases. The measure was strengthened by provisions added by Senator Bernie Sanders, including a $300 billion commitment over the next four decades to encourage the development of renewable sources energy like solar, wind and geothermal power.
   ""With that kind of federal funding, sustainable energy will become far more widespread than is currently the case,"" Sanders told The Burlington Free Press. A member of the committee, Sanders said the bill would spur ""an incredible burst forward"" toward greater use of cleaner sources of energy. 
   The bill also set more stringent emissions standards than an earlier version of the legislation.
   ""If we can overcome politics as usual, if we utilize the knowledge and technology that is available today, not only can we reverse global warming, but we can create millions of good-paying jobs,"" Sanders said.
   At the outset of what turned out to be a day-long the committee meeting, Sanders called the bill ""an important step forward in the fight against global warming."" He continued:
   ""What the leading scientists of the world are telling us in more and more urgent tones is that global warming is a catastrophic crisis facing our planet and that if we do not act boldly and aggressively our nation and the entire world face a very dire future impacting the lives of billions of people. It will be a future of massive floods, droughts, loss of drinking water and farmland, extreme weather conditions and international conflicts fought over limited natural resources. It will be a future of very significant economic dislocation. That is not my opinion. That is the opinion of the most knowledgeable scientists in this world, many of whom have just won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on global warming.
   ""What these scientists are now telling us is that the problem is even more severe than they had previously believed and that if we, industrialized nations responsible for most of the emissions, do not cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80 percent by the year 2050 there is a 50 percent chance that we will reach a tipping point at which time massive damage will be unavoidable. That is the bad news.
   ""But there is also some very good news. If we can overcome politics as usual, if we utilize the knowledge and technology that is available today, not only can we reverse global warming but we can create millions of good jobs in the process. 
   ""In other words, we are not helpless in this conflict. The tools and knowledge are there and, if we summon up the political courage, we can make great strides forward and lead the world in reversing global warming. 
   ""What should we be doing?
   ""First, in terms of sustainable energy, there is almost unlimited potential. In that regard I want to thank Senators Boxer, Lieberman and Warner for revising the legislation that came out of the subcommittee and putting into the bill we're considering today a suggestion that I made which will specifically provide, from the auction process, some $300 billion for sustainable energy - including wind, solar, and geothermal. With effective cooperation between the federal government and the private sector, a very substantial part of the energy needs of this country will, within the next few decades, come from such clear and sustainable technologies - and they will be less expensive than the conventional fuels we use today.
   ""Second, the potential for cutting carbon emissions through strong energy efficiency efforts is extraordinary. If we raise CAFE standards for our vehicles and create a first-class rail and public transportation system, if we retrofit our homes, offices and factories and create strong energy efficient building standards for new construction, we can save massive amounts of energy and substantially cut greenhouse gas emissions.
   ""Many of us on this committee have children and grandchildren. We owe it to them, and to all the children of this world, to reverse global warming and leave them a planet they can fully enjoy. The truth is that we now have the knowledge and technology to accomplish that goal. What has been lacking is the political will. I hope today that we can, in fact, develop that will. Thank you.""

1835,"ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, GREENER ENVIRONMENT
  The Senate passed an energy bill that Sen. Bernie Sanders helped shape as a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. ""While this energy bill is not as strong as I would like, it is certainly a major step forward in breaking our dependence on fossil fuels and moving us toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy,"" Sanders said.  
  ""The sweeping energy legislation?would mandate the first substantial change in the nation's vehicle fuel-efficiency law since 1975 despite opposition from auto companies,"" the Washington Post reported. According to The Wall Street Jounral, the bill would ""increase fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, provide tax incentives for development of alternative fuels and require far greater use of ethanol and other so-called renewable automotive fuels.'
  In addition to raising fuel economy standards, the bill includes a Sanders' proposal to provide block grants to states and local governments for energy efficiency projects.
  Another provision Sanders added to the bill in committee would support energy-saving projects at colleges and universities.
  The bill also includes a job-training provision to train workers for green-collar jobs, language the Senate adopted on June 12 in an amendment by Sanders and Senate Hillary Clinton. A study last year by the National Renewable Energy Lab identified the shortage of training as ""a leading non-technical barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth.""
  ""I am very excited about both the economic opportunities in front of us and the possibility of Vermont playing a leadership role in breaking our dependence on fossil fuel, moving towards energy efficiency, moving to sustainable energy,"" Sanders said.
  The bill also would:
  * Raise fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon. Automakers are now required to meet an average of 27.5 mpg for cars and 22.2 mpg for SUVs and small trucks. 
  * Require that half of the new cars manufactured be able to run on 85 percent ethanol blends by 2015.
  * Authorize grants, loan guarantees and other assistance to promote research into fuel efficient vehicles, including hybrids, advanced diesel and battery technologies. 
   * Require production of 36 billion gallons a year of ethanol, as a substitute for gasoline, by 2022, from corn, prairie grass and wood chips.

1340,April 17  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to Reassess the Potential Human Health Hazard Posed by the Uranium  Radium  and Thorium Waste at the Tonawanda Landfill

                      Urges Corps to Ensure the Thorough Remediation of the Tonawanda Landfill Property and Vicinity

                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a new assessment of the Tonawanda Landfill under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program  FUSRAP  to ensure that the remnants of radioactive materials in vicinity of the property are not hazardous to residents   As part of its FUSRAP program  The U S  Army Corps of Engineers has worked to assess the health risks associated with the radionuclide waste in the landfill and concluded the levels to be within acceptable U S  Environmental Protection Agency guidelines   However  in a letter today to the Buffalo District Engineer of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  Senator Clinton emphasized that the Tonawanda area has been impacted by a legacy of FUSRAP sites in their community and the health concerns due to these sites contaminated with the remnants of Manhattan Engineer District  MED  materials deserve to be answered   Senator Clinton said that it was imperative that the Corps reassess its conclusion that the Uranium  Radium  and Thorium waste at the site are unconnected to the Linde site or other MED activities and ensure proper remediation action  The Senator urged the USACE to respond to the needs of the community and their concerns for the future health and safety of their children           The close proximity of homes and Riverview Elementary School makes the comprehensive remediation of the Tonawanda Landfill Vicinity Property absolutely essential to insuring the health and safety of Tonawanda residents  The Corps must verify that radioactive materials have not migrated through the soil or the groundwater outside of the Landfill Vicinity Property   said Senator Clinton  I am deeply concerned that the U S  Army Corps of Engineers would neglect to survey these neighborhoods and allow these materials to migrate into the backyards and homes of Tonawanda  The cooperation and expertise of the Corps will provide the community with critical information to better assess the future of this land         A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below       Lieutenant Colonel  EN  John S  Hurley  P E   District Commander  Department of the Army  Buffalo District  Corps of Engineers  1776 Niagara Street  Buffalo  New York 14207      RE  The Town of Tonawanda Landfill Vicinity Property      Dear Colonel Hurley       I write in regard to the United States Army Corps of Engineers work at the Tonawanda Landfill under the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program  FUSRAP             The people of Tonawanda have suffered enough as a result of the remnants of Manhattan Engineer District  MED  materials and other manufacturing wastes  which have left a legacy of FUSRAP sites in their community   They deserve to know with absolute certainty that it is safe for them to live and work in their own community  and for their children to play in their own backyards   Unfortunately  the Corps  proposed cleanup plan does not provide these assurances  and I ask that you make a number of improvements to the plan          First  to ensure that proper remediation action is taken  it is imperative that the Corps reassess its conclusion that the Uranium  Radium  and Thorium waste at this site are unconnected to the Linde site or other MED activities          Second  the plan should include an expanded Human Health Risk Assessment   In light of proposed recreational use of this land after site remediation is complete  I strongly urge the Corps to work with City and State officials to ensure that the Tonawanda Landfill Vicinity Property is completely surveyed and that the most stringent federal standards are applied in assessing the human health risk posed by the materials present at this site to the residents and children of Tonawanda   In addition  because the landfill is in close proximity to more than 700 residential homes as well as the Riverview Elementary School  the Corps should conduct sampling on neighboring properties to ensure that these families are not at risk   The Corps must verify that radioactive materials have not migrated through soils or hydrology outside of the Landfill Vicinity Property and into the backyards and homes of Tonawanda          Thank you for your consideration             Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0

                                       CONTACT  Ashley Glacel  Kohl  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Report Released in Advance of Tomorrow s House Energy   Commerce Hearing   WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today joined with Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  and Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA   Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance  were joined by Rep  John D  Dingell  D MI   Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  Rep  Joe Barton  R TX   Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  and other Senate and House colleagues in by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  on the consumer protections states have in place for those who purchase long term care insurance  LTCI     Due to the rapid aging of America s population  the marketplace for long term care services is expected to expand significantly   Private LTCI has emerged as one possible way individuals can prepare for their long term care needs later in life   In their request to GAO  members of Congress expressed their interest in examining the frequency with which consumers are experiencing denial of benefits and exorbitant rate increases   In light of such practices  the GAO report examined the robustness of states  rate setting standards and the rules for settling of benefit denials  Congressional requesters expect to use the report findings as a guideline for determining the future viability of LTCI and to consider what  if any  regulatory steps could be taken on the federal level to strengthen consumer protections   Tomorrow at 10 00 a m  in 2123 Rayburn House Office Building  Rep  Bart Stupak  D MI   Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  will hold a hearing entitled   Long Term Care Insurance  Are Consumers Protected for the Long Term    This hearing is the second in the subcommittee s series to explore issues of long term care service delivery and financing issues  GAO found that rate increases for LTCI policies fluctuate widely from state to state and plan to plan   For example  one company cited in the report repeatedly raised premiums  resulting in a cumulative increase of more than 70 percent since 1991  while another company has raised premiums only once since 1975   According to the report  rate stability standards  which are designed to protect consumers against sharp premium increases  have now been adopted by more than half of all states   However  because many states have not yet adopted these standards  a vast number of consumers are still left unprotected   Additionally  because the rate standards are so new  state regulators are unsure of how successful they will be in moderating future premium increases  GAO also reviewed claims settled by LTCI companies in ten states by evaluating consumer complaints   The report found that standards for the timely payment of consumer claims varied significantly by state  with  timely  being defined as five days in one state and 45 days in another   One state did not have a timeliness requirement at all   GAO also noted that some states are considering implementing an external appeals process for adjudicating disputed claims  The federal government expects that as many as 30 states will have Long Term Care Partnership programs in place by the end of this year   These programs encourage the private purchase of LTCI and feature state approved plans that combine private LTCI with possible add on Medicaid coverage in policies that allow consumers to protect some portion of their accumulated financial assets   Many state officials  as well as LTCI providers  are enthusiastically supporting rollout of these Partnership programs   As programs of this nature unfold across the country  the GAO report s findings make it clear that consumers who are urged by state governments to purchase these plans must have access to comprehensive  accurate information about Partnership approved plans to determine whether they are a sound and affordable choice for them  The report was requested jointly by the following   Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA   Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance  Rep  John D  Dingell  D MI   Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  Rep  Joe Barton  R TX   Ranking Member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  Senator Byron Dorgan  D ND   Senator Amy Klobuchar  D MN   Senator Barack Obama  D IL     We need to make sure we get some of these already troubling issues resolved  especially since state governments are partnering with long term care insurance companies   said Senator Kohl    Congress is doing the right thing by taking a close look at long term care insurance to make sure consumers are protected    Affordable and comprehensive long term care is critical for the health  safety and independence of America s seniors   said Senator Obama    Many Americans are spending thousands of dollars on private long term care insurance  and yet when they need help the most  they often face lengthy waiting periods and wrongful denials of claims   We must take steps to strengthen oversight of this industry  ensure claims processes are consistent and fair  and guarantee that benefit packages offer the financial protection promised   I commend Chairman Kohl for his leadership on this important issue  and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address the findings of this report     The very high costs of long term care make it smart public policy to help people manage their financial risk with long term care insurance policies   It s also important to make sure these products are viable and don t leave consumers with big premiums and little security   This new report provides helpful information for federal and state lawmakers  regulators and consumer watchdogs in meeting that challenge   Senator Grassley said   The GAO s findings and our own Committee staff s investigation have identified troubling weaknesses in the states  ability to protect consumers from abusive practices   said Rep  Dingell    If the insurance industry is not up to the task of correcting these problems swiftly and treating vulnerable policyholders and their families fairly then Congress will need to consider steps to ensure strong  uniform national standards   Our oversight hearing tomorrow will lay the groundwork for urgently needed reforms in the industry and at the state and federal levels    As more and more Americans choose to purchase private long term care insurance to prepare for future needs  we must ensure that the product is fair and accessible   Companies  in partnership with government  should offer fair pricing  transparency in premium increases  and timely responses to complaints   I am proud that my state of New York was a pioneer in the Long Term Care Partnership program  and also holds some of the highest standards in the country for these types of consumer protections  As this GAO report makes clear  however  the federal government has a role to play  we need to take steps to ensure that seniors have the resources and information they need to make the right choices about long term care   said Senator Clinton   When planning for their long term care  people want the peace of mind that their insurance premiums won t be increased in dramatic and unpredictable ways  and that they ll have timely access to care   said Senator Dorgan    This type of basic stability for long term care will protect consumers and provide better healthcare access for those who need it    This report underscores the need for a new approach to long term care insurance to ensure that as the baby boom generation ages  standards will be in place to help people plan for their health care needs   said Senator Klobuchar    Long term care insurance will be critical to ensuring that our seniors have the care they need to live independently and stay in their own homes as long as possible    The GAO has identified significant gaps among the states in their abilities to protect consumers from abusive practices by their insurance companies   Rep  Stupak said    We look forward to hearing more tomorrow from GAO  other experts  state regulators and the industry itself about these issues  and to hearing their ideas for addressing the problems that policyholders face when they need to use the insurance they have struggled so hard to pay for     The GAO report can be found here                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts

1717,"FEED THE HUNGRY
  Vermont, like other states around the country, is struggling to fulfill the growing needs of people who are hungry. The Vermont Food Bank has said its supply of food had fallen by 50 percent from last year. Burlington's food shelf has seen a dramatic increase in employed clients in need of help this year. As winter closes in and the president persists in blocking assistance with rising home heating bill, still more Vermonters are turning to the food support network in Vermont for help. Senator Sanders signed onto legislation that would increase support for food banks.  
   This legislation offers $40 million in emergency funding for the Department of Agriculture's Emergency Food Assistance Program. It would be a temporary fix. The farm bill, as it currently stands, would increase funding of this program from $140 million to $250 million.
   The food shortage crisis appears to be the result of a perfect storm; all at once there is rising demand, declining donations of food stuffs from grocery stores and wholesalers, and higher commodity prices. Rob Meehan, the new director at Burlington's Chittenden Emergency Food Shelf, told the Free Press there also has been a recent increase in for-profit businesses which compete for inexpensive foods with food shelves.
   Today, 45 percent of clients at Burlington's food shelf are employed, a 10 percent increase from 2006. Thirty-six percent of their clients are children. Some 5,500 meals are served and 1,800 households receive groceries from CEFS each month.

                     Senators Say Immediate Action is Needed to Defeat Likely Spring Offensive by Taliban Washington  DC    On the heels of a four day trip to Iraq and Afghanistan  U S  Senators Evan Bayh  D IN  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  today wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates urging him to deploy more troops to Afghanistan to maintain progress there and help the Afghans against a likely Taliban offensive in the spring              The Taliban   and its al Qaeda partner   remains a pernicious enemy  and a failure to defeat it decisively in the spring risks undermining public confidence in the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai     Bayh and Clinton wrote in their letter     It would be tragic if we fail in Afghanistan because of an unwillingness to deploy a manageable size of additional troops to aid an important and willing ally during a time of true need             In their letter  Bayh and Clinton  both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee  described meetings at which American military commanders expressed concern that there would not be enough U S  troops to fight insurgents and requested an increase of approximately 2 300 U S  troops   The Senators also highlighted the continued shortage in Intelligence  Reconnaissance and Surveillance  ISR  capabilities  including Predator unmanned aerial vehicles  and the importance of helping a country that has proven to be a willing partner in the fight against terrorism            Unlike in Iraq  we have a government in Afghanistan committed to promoting national interests over sectarian ones  is making tangible progress in governance  sincerely wants more U S  help  and is fighting the enemy that brought us September 11th     Bayh and Clinton wrote          During their recent trip to Afghanistan  Bayh and Clinton attended a lunch hosted by Afghanistan  s President Hamid Karzai and later met in Lahore  Pakistan  with General Pervez Musharraf  the President of Pakistan   In Afghanistan  they also met with Major General Benjamin Freakley  Commanding General of the 10th Mountain Division and Fort Drum  had breakfast with U S  troops at Bagram Airbase  and visited with U S  troops stationed at Camp Eggers   In addition  Bayh and Clinton met with U S  Ambassador Ronald Neumann and Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry  commander of Combined Forces Command    Afghanistan          The full text of the letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates follows           January 17  2006      The Honorable Robert Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301    Dear Mr  Secretary       We recently returned from an important fact finding trip to Iraq  Afghanistan and Pakistan   Our trip has been extraordinarily useful in helping us assess the situation on the ground in each country and in giving us another opportunity to thank the brave men and women of the United States military for their service   While we hope to soon discuss with you our impressions of the deteriorating situation in Iraq  we write this letter now  and with utmost urgency  about the need to expand our stabilization presence and increase the number of U S  troops in Afghanistan before the likely Taliban offensive in the spring          In our discussions with commanders in Afghanistan  they explained to us that they expect a large offensive by the Taliban in southern Afghanistan this spring and the urgency of a decisive victory against the Taliban and its supporters   The commanders expressed their concern that there would not be enough U S  troops to conduct all necessary counter insurgency operations in the already volatile south and east of the country   Specifically  the commanders told us there is an urgent need to maintain and then expand our presence in Afghanistan by two infantry battalions  and possibly a third battalion for a total commitment of approximately 2 300 troops   We understand one way this can be accomplished is by having one battalion stay in country longer  and having at least one other battalion prepared to be sent to the field immediately   A third battalion would be ready for deployment should the situation so warrant          The Taliban   and its al Qaeda partner   remains a pernicious enemy  and a failure to defeat it decisively in the spring risks undermining public confidence in the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai    It would be tragic if we fail in Afghanistan because of an unwillingness to deploy a manageable size of additional troops to aid an important and willing ally during a time of true need          We also were told by the commanders that there is an overall shortage of Intelligence  Reconnaissance and Surveillance  ISR  capabilities in Afghanistan   In particular  the commanders told us they need more Predator unmanned aerial vehicles   More than five years after 9 11  this is unacceptable           Unlike in Iraq  we have a government in Afghanistan committed to promoting national interests over sectarian ones  is making tangible progress in governance  sincerely wants more U S  help  and is fighting the enemy that brought us September 11              We know that you share our goal of defending the nation against radical extremism and terrorism   It is in this context that we respectfully ask that the commanders   requirements in Afghanistan be met  and that this happen with the highest urgency             Thank you for your consideration           Sincerely       Evan Bayh  Hillary Rodham Clinton       Read Senator Clinton s trip report from Iraq and Afghanistan

                                    Senators Laud Energy Security Leadership Council Call for Increase in Fuel Economy Standards Wednesday  December 13  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama contact

Standards Plan Echoes Senators  Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Fuel Economy Standards   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Dick Lugar  R IN   and Joe Biden  D DE  today praised the Energy Security Leadership Council for recommending that the United States greatly reduce its dependence on foreign oil by enacting a proposal to increase fuel economy standards that is nearly identical to legislation they introduced in July  Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Tom Harkin  D IA   Norm Coleman  R MN   Dick Durbin  D IL   Gordon Smith  R OR   Arlen Specter  R PA   Maria Cantwell  D WA  and Chuck Schumer  D NY  are also cosponsors of the legislation    The Energy Security Leadership Council is an effort by a collection of prominent business leaders and retired senior military officers to build support for a comprehensive  long term policy to reduce U S  oil dependence and improve energy security  To read a copy of the report  visit this website  http   www secureenergy org     The true danger of America s dependence on foreign oil is best explained by enemies like Al Qaeda  who have said that oil      is the umbilical cord and lifeline of the crusader community    Obama said    It is clear that the Achilles heel of the most powerful country on earth is the oil we import and cannot live without  and that is why we must increase the fuel efficiency of our cars with technology we already have on the shelf       Leadership by private industry  the military  and across sectors and levels of government is an essential component in making meaningful progress   Lugar said   I m pleased that the Council and SAFE have made an important contribution to our ongoing policy debate   Increasing fuel economy is one facet of a comprehensive energy strategy that the United States must adopt in the interest of our national security      If it was not clear before  it is now  Domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Joseph R  Biden   For our national security we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without making progress on fuel economy by upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with predictable increases in fuel efficiency standards for cars  SUVs and light trucks       The bipartisan legislation  the Fuel Economy Reform Act of 2006  seeks to break the decades long logjam on increasing fuel economy standards by taking a new  more flexible approach  The bill charges the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration  NHTSA  to create regular annual increases in fuel economy with a target of approximately 1 mile per gallon each year  The experts at NHTSA will base these standards on attributes of a vehicle such as size and weight  and will be able to revise the annual increase if they conclude that the target cannot be reached with current technology or without compromising the safety of the entire fleet  or is not cost effective when compared to the economic and geopolitical value of a gallon of gasoline saved    This legislation flips the current debate about increasing fuel economy standards on its head  from a debate about whether standards will be raised to presumption that they will be raised    In order to enable domestic manufacturers to develop more fuel efficient vehicles  the legislation also provides generous tax incentives for companies to retool parts and assembly plants  This would strengthen the U S  auto industry by allowing them to compete with foreign hybrid  E 85 and other fuel efficient vehicles  The bill would also allow more Americans to benefit from a tax credit for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles by lifting the current cap that only makes eligible the first 60 000 buyers per manufacturer each year    If this 4 percent per year improvement is maintained for 20 years  this bill would reduce gasoline consumption by 549 billion gallons  If gasoline were just  2 50 per gallon  consumers would save  1 372 trillion at the pump by 2028    The Fuel Economy Reform Act would also provide fairness and flexibility to domestic automakers by establishing different standards for different types of cars  Currently  manufacturers have to meet broad standards over their whole fleet of cars  This disadvantages companies like Ford and General Motors that produce full lines of small and large cars and trucks rather than manufacturers that only sell small cars                                     ,1
1549,December 19  2007 Clinton  Schumer  Lautenberg  Menendez  Maloney  Nadler  Fossella Announce Final Congressional Passage of  108 Million to Expand Health Coverage for 9 11 Emergency Responders and Others

         Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  and Robert Menendez  along with Representatives Carolyn Maloney  Jerrold Nadler  and Vito Fossella today announced final Congressional passage of an additional  108 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  The money builds on the  50 million that was provided in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that was signed into law earlier this year  bringing total funding for the year to  158 million    The latest funding increase was approved as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill and includes  51 5 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill and  56 5 million in additional emergency spending  The omnibus bill  which includes 11 appropriations bills  will now be sent to the President for signature    As a nation we can accept nothing short of unwavering federal support for these ailing heroes of September 11th  Our brave responders who risked all to save others  and those residents and workers who immediately began rebuilding our shattered city  faced great adversity with calm determination six years ago  We must show the same resolve now in standing with them as they grapple with the lasting medical problems that are the legacy of that tragic day  Senator Clinton said  I welcome this new funding as an important step that will sustain these programs while we work on a bipartisan  long term solution in the Senate    It is high time that the first responders and residents of Lower Manhattan that were exposed to toxins six years ago receive the treatment they need and deserve  I am pleased that this essential funding for the men and women who are now suffering from the effects of the attacks has been approved  and promise to continue to fight for the full funding they need  said Senator Schumer    First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero  Its time we give these heroes the treatment they deserve  said Senator Lautenberg    Senator Menendez said  This is the type of federal commitment that puts the mantra We will never forget into action  and its the type of commitment that had been lacking in previous Congresses  With major investments in the health of those who inhaled the toxic air around Ground Zero  we can help address the needs of all those who deserve their government s attention and resources  whether they developed symptoms in the days after 9 11 or in the years after 9 11  Moving forward  we cannot rest until all of those who inhaled the toxic dust around Ground Zero are examined and those found to be sick are treated   This landmark bill would for the very first time ensure a full years funding for federal 9 11 health clinics  said Congresswoman Maloney  In addition  these funds will help provide care not only to 9 11 responders  but to lower Manhattan residents  workers and students  as well  The New York delegation worked hard to make sure that in 2008  9 11 health clinic doctors wont have to worry about keeping their doors open  I urge the President to support this funding and sign this important bill    This landmark funding is a tremendous step toward caring for those who  six years later   are still suffering as a result of the 9 11 attacks on our nation  said Congressman Nadler  As Abraham Lincoln said  we must care for him who shall have borne the battle  We must also continue fighting for comprehensive health benefits for all those who have become sick as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Center  whether they be first responders  local residents  office workers  or students  And we must ensure a full and proper clean up of all affected areas  so that no more innocent people will be harmed by the environmental scars of 9 11    This funding will finally provide medical monitoring and treatment to all the unsung heroes of 9 11  including 9 11 responders  area workers  residents and others  It is also an important step forward in fulfilling our responsibility to help all those who are sick today as well as those who become ill in the future  said Congressman Vito Fossella    The  108 million in new funding will go towards monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The  51 5 million portion in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill also includes statutory language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mount Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    The lawmakers said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed         ,0

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Continuing her efforts to mitigate the ongoing problems New Yorkers are experiencing with the new Medicare prescription drug program  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she is cosponsoring two new pieces of legislation to address a gap in coverage  known as the   doughnut hole     that will strike millions of beneficiaries across the country in the coming months   During this gap  enrollees have no drug coverage and have to pay full price for their medications   To add insult to injury  enrollees are still responsible to pay their monthly drug premiums during this time            It is outrageous that millions of beneficiaries will be forced to pay full price for their medications and on top of that continue to pay premiums for a prescription drug plan that isn  t paying for their medications   This defies logic and will put an unacceptable burden on New York  s seniors and people with disabilities already struggling to make ends meet   Beneficiaries have a right to expect that the drug plan they are paying a premium for will cover their prescription drug costs   We need to close this gap and make sure that prescription drug plans are working for beneficiaries     said Senator Clinton          Under the Medicare law  the new Part D benefit provides a voluntary prescription drug benefit to the 43 million people enrolled in Medicare   In 2006  the benefit has a  250 deductible  covers 75 percent of prescription drug costs up to a coverage limit of  2 250  followed by the gap in coverage where beneficiaries pay 100 percent of their prescription drug costs until they reach  5 100 in drug costs   At this point  they have hit the   catastrophic limit    and the Medicare Part D benefit pays 95 percent of the beneficiaries   drug costs through the end of the year  when the cycle starts all over again   More than one third of all Medicare beneficiaries are projected to have drug spending at the level where they would be affected by this gap  according to the Congressional Budget Office   In New York  1 33 million people have prescription drug coverage governed by Medicare Part D rules   If one third are affected  400 000 New Yorkers could be impacted by this coverage gap in 2006          Senator Clinton is cosponsoring the Prescription for Fairness Act  which would provide short term relief for seniors and people with disabilities by waiving the Medicare Part D premium for any month that a senior falls into the doughnut hole  by requiring the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to pay the premium on behalf of the affected beneficiary   This cost will be offset by reducing a   slush fund    in the Medicare law that benefits insurance companies            Senator Clinton is also cosponsoring the Medicare Prescription Gap Act to address the dire situation faced by our most vulnerable low income beneficiaries   This bill will allow costs incurred by federally qualified health centers  AIDS Drug Assistance Programs  Indian pharmacies  certain safety net hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturer sponsored Patient Assistance Programs   entities that provide prescription drugs or drug assistance for populations under their care   to count toward a beneficiary s annual out of pocket threshold   Under current law  costs incurred by these programs on behalf of Part D enrollees during the time they are in the doughnut hole are not permitted to count towards reaching that  5 100 threshold   As a result  many individuals with HIV AIDS  Native Americans  and other low income individuals receiving assistance through community health centers or other qualified safety net hospital pharmacies will get stuck in the doughnut hole and never reach the point at which Medicare would pay 95 percent of the beneficiary  s drug costs              Senator Clinton is also a cosponsor of legislation introduced earlier this year  the Medicare Prescription Drug Gap Reduction Act   This legislation will reduce the impact of the doughnut hole on Medicare beneficiaries by giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to negotiate with drug companies to obtain the lowest possible price for Medicare beneficiaries  and requiring that savings from this provision be applied towards reducing the impact of the doughnut hole on Medicare beneficiaries          Senator Clinton has been a vocal advocate for the need to fix the problems plaguing the new Medicare prescription drug program and to ensure that Medicare recipients receive the assistance they need and deserve   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has called on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to release to the public the quality and performance information it collects on participating plans about levels of service provided to consumers  including information about grievances  appeals and complaints  This   report card    of participating plans would help hold them to high standards and help consumers make informed choices about plans            Senator Clinton has also co sponsored comprehensive legislation that would make needed fixes to the program  including helping those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid transition into the new Medicare prescription drug benefit by requiring outreach and education to pharmacies on dually eligible beneficiaries and waiving the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting these beneficiaries  She has also co sponsored legislation that would prevent Medicare prescription drug plans from ending coverage of drugs that were available when beneficiaries enrolled in the plan and extend the amount of time seniors have to enroll in the program  In addition  Senator Clinton has released a resource guide to prescription drug coverage under Medicare  available in English and Spanish  to help New Yorkers navigate this transition  The guide has been distributed to more than 75 000 New Yorkers and is posted on Senator Clinton  s website at www clinton senate gov           ,0
1980,"SENS. BYRD, SANDERS SECURE FUNDS FOR GULF WAR ILLNESS RESEARCH
  U.S. Senators Robert C. Byrd, D-West Virginia, and Bernie Senders, I-Vermont, applauded the Senate's passage of a $10,000,000 investment in research to combat Gulf War Illness. Byrd and Sanders led the effort to include the funding in the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations legislation, which cleared the Senate on November 9th. 
   ""As recent research has further demonstrated, an alarming number of Gulf War veterans continue to suffer serious ailments as a result of exposure to toxic materials during the Persian Gulf War,"" said Byrd. ""It is our moral responsibility to help those who are suffering as a result of illnesses contracted while serving our nation. We can and must do more to find treatments and cures for these serious ailments."" 
   ""Over 175,000 veterans are still suffering from a poorly understood set of illnesses related to their service in the first Gulf War,"" said Sanders. ""After years of denial and resistance from the Defense Department and the VA, we are finally beginning to see some promising research that could help our ill service members. This research funding means that we are keeping faith with those who so honorably served our country and who deserve real treatment and a government that lives up to its promise to care for those that wear our uniform.""
   The complex of symptoms commonly known as ""Gulf War Illnesses (GWI)"" - widespread pain, cognitive impairment, and persistent fatigue in conjunction with diverse other symptoms and abnormalities - are associated with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations in the early 1990s during the Persian Gulf War. Byrd and Sanders' efforts are consistent with the Pentagon's historical commitment to finding treatments and cures for the estimated 175,000 Gulf War veterans affected - roughly a fourth of those who served. 
   The provision authorizes $10 million in funding for Gulf War Illnesses research to be conducted by the US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command's Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) (http://cdmrp.army.mil/aboutus.htm)., which last year initiated a promising pilot program to identify treatments and diagnostic tests for Gulf War illnesses. 
   The following Veterans Service Organizations support the Byrd/Sanders provision:
   * American Legion 
   * Veterans of Foreign Wars 
   * Disabled American Veterans 
   * Paralyzed Veterans of America 
   * Vietnam Veterans of America 
   * AMVETS 
   * Veterans of Modern Warfare 
  GULF WAR ILLNESS FACTS
   Three new studies recently released by a team from Boston University, VA, and the Army have added to the compelling body of recent research showing that these illnesses are serious neurological conditions resulting from toxic exposures during the war. 
  Ill veterans with five or more symptoms showed a loss of brain mass in MRI scans of areas related to learning and memory, and also performed significantly worse on objective learning and memory tests. 
  Veterans exposed to low levels of nerve gas following the destruction of a major Iraqi arms depot at Khamisiyah, Iraq, showed a loss of brain white matter and poor performance on motor coordination tests equivalent to aging 20 years. 
  Previous studies have shown that Gulf War veterans have double the rate of ALS found in other veterans, and that veterans potentially exposed at Kamisiyah have double the expected rate of brain cancer deaths. 
  Current and future American military forces, as well as civilians, are also at risk of similar exposures and will benefit from the research supported through this funding.

allies alongside more than a dozen other countries bears testimony to how the alliance can contribute to the 21st century missions that are vital to the security of the United States and its allies  NATO s involvement provides capabilities  legitimacy  and coordination in Afghanistan that simply would not be available if NATO did not exist   Success in Afghanistan is vital to the security of the United States  to all NATO members  and to the people of Afghanistan  NATO s leaders must therefore send an unambiguous message that every country in NATO will do whatever needs to be done to destroy terrorist networks in Afghanistan  to prevent the Taliban from returning to power  and to bring greater security and well being to the Afghan people  This will require adequate numbers of capable military forces and civilian personnel from NATO members and putting more of an Afghan face on counter insurgency operations by providing more training and resources to the Afghan National Army and police forces  and by embedding more Afghan forces in NATO missions  We must also win long term public support through assistance programs that make a difference in the lives of the Afghan people  including investments in infrastructure and education  the development of alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers to undermine the Taliban and other drug traffickers  and increased efforts to combat corruption through safeguards on assistance and support for the rule of law   Success in Afghanistan will also require the removal of restrictions that some allies have placed on their forces in Afghanistan  which hamper the flexibility of commanders on the ground  The mission in Afghanistan  legitimized by a United Nations mandate  supported by the Afghan people  and endorsed by all NATO members after the United States was attacked is central to NATO s future as a collective security organization  Afghanistan presents a test of whether NATO can carry out the crucial missions of the 21st century  and NATO must come together to meet that challenge  Now is the time for all NATO allies to recommit to this common purpose   The summit must also address the question of the alliance expanding membership  NATO enlargement since the end of the Cold War has helped the countries of Central and Eastern Europe become more stable and democratic  It has also added to NATO military capability by facilitating contributions from new members to critical missions such as Afghanistan   The three current candidates for NATO membership  Albania  Croatia and the Republic of Macedonia  have each made great strides in consolidating their new democracies  They have reformed their defense establishments  worked to root out corruption  modernized their economies  and contributed to NATO security missions in the Balkans and Afghanistan  Responding to these efforts with NATO membership at the upcoming summit would add to the alliance military capabilities while contributing to stability in the Balkans  a region still suffering from the ethnic tensions left behind by the bloodshed of the 1990s   Ukraine and Georgia have also been developing their ties with NATO  Their leaders have declared their readiness to advance a NATO Membership Action Plan  MAP  to prepare for the rights and obligations of membership  They are working to consolidate democratic reforms and to undertake new responsibilities in their relationship with the Alliance  I welcome the desire and actions of these countries to seek closer ties with NATO and hope that NATO responds favorably to their request  consistent with its criteria for membership  Whether Ukraine and Georgia ultimately join NATO will be a decision for the members of the alliance and the citizens of those countries  after a period of open and democratic debate  But they should receive our help and encouragement as they continue to develop ties to Atlantic and European institutions   NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia  Russia has an important role to play in European and global affairs and should see NATO as a partner  not as a threat  But we should oppose any efforts by the Russian government to intimidate its neighbors or control their foreign policies  Russia cannot have a veto over which countries join the alliance  Since the end of the Cold War  Republican and Democratic administrations have supported the independence and sovereignty of all the states of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union  and we must continue to do so  President Putin recent threat to point missiles at Ukraine is simply not the way to promote the peaceful 21st century Europe we seek   NATO stands as an example of how the United States can advance American national security  and the security of the world  through a strong alliance rooted in shared responsibility and shared values  NATO remains a vital asset in America s efforts to anchor democracy and stability in Europe and to defend our interests and values all over the world  The Bucharest summit provides an opportunity to advance these goals and to reinforce a vital alliance  NATO s leaders must seize that opportunity

210,   Avian Flu Press Conference   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Avian Flu Press Conference Tuesday  November  1  2005  Remarks of Senator Barack Obama  Washington  DC   It has now been more than one year since the government first released its draft Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan    In that year  we have witnessed the relentless spread of avian flu from Southeast Asia to Western China  from Russia to the European continent     Just yesterday  we learned that it may have come even closer to home     Ducks in seven Canadian provinces have now tested positive for avian flu   If further tests do indeed show that they are carrying the H5N1 strain  it is only a matter of weeks before a migrating bird brings this deadly disease to our front door     121 people have already contracted the avian flu from infected birds   Sixty two have lost their lives   And if the virus ever mutates so that it can be passed from human to human  we will face global pandemic influenza that may kill millions    Forty countries now have pandemic preparedness plans  but until today  the United States was not one of them     Countries like Japan  France  England  and others have now stockpiled enough Tamiflu to cover a quarter of their populations   With enough to cover just two percent of our population  the United States is again not one of these countries     We find this unacceptable  and so we are encouraged by the President s decision today to join the efforts we ve been pursuing in Congress to combat the avian flu for nearly a year   But we must do more to prevent this pandemic   Much more         Mr  President  the United States cannot afford to have a Katrina level of preparedness or a Katrina like response to an international outbreak of Avian flu   With so many warnings and so much knowledge of the threat we face  there is no excuse for failure this time around     The President said today that this pandemic would require  the immediate attention of the United States Congress so we can have the resources in place to begin implementing this strategy right away     The good news is that many of us in Congress did not wait for the President to schedule a speech   Instead  we have already acted to ensure that our country is not left behind    In March  I requested  25 million in funding for greater global partnership  with the creation of an international council and more surveillance   This is money being used to prevent the flu right now      The President said he was going to send the Congress a funding request for  7 1 billion dollars for avian flu preparedness at home   But fortunately  the resources are already there     In September  we successfully secured  3 9 billion in funding  and just last week I worked with Senator Harkin and others to increase that number to  7 9 billion    In the AVIAN Act of 2005  which I introduced in April  I laid out a number of steps that were echoed by the President today   However  the legislation went a few steps further   Obviously we haven t seen the written plan just yet  but I do want to point out a few additional areas that should be part of this Administration s plan     First  the plan does not lay out a clear chain of command in the event of a crisis   It is unclear whether the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Health and Human Services will lead the response effort  but we have all seen during Katrina how important a clear chain of command is  and so the President should clarify this     Second  the plan s outreach and avian flu educational efforts seem limited to those with the ability to visit the government s website   The Senate included  75 million for an aggressive outreach campaign to the American public  and the President should do the same    Third  the President s proposed investment in the stockpiling of antivirals may fall short of what is ultimately needed   In the Senate we allocated an additional  2 billion to cover half of the American population   More will be needed if we are to prevent a pandemic    The President s proposal allocates money differently   he uses more money for the development of cell based vaccines   While this is good  again  more funding is needed to ensure we have the antiviral medicine our country needs    Fourth  it is unclear how much assistance the federal government is willing to provide already cash strapped states to strengthen their fragile health infrastructures   The Senate appropriations bill provides  600 million to bolster the public health infrastructure   We should keep this figure    Finally  the President s plan does not request funding for contingency planning and surge capacity for hospitals   The Senate provides  750 million to help doctors and hospitals expand their services and care for more patients in case of pandemic     The devastation wrought by the hurricanes of the last few months has shown us that we cannot stop the forces of nature   But as the wealthiest country on Earth  we can prepare  and we can respond in a way that saves as many lives as possible     We must do that now with the Avian Flu     We are encouraged that the Administration has finally released its preparedness plan  and we look forward to working with them on implementing the strongest version possible as soon as possible                                     ,1

1886,"SIGN PETITION AND TELL BUSH CHILDREN DESERVE HEALTH CARE
  Children's advocates on Thursday stepped up efforts to persuade President Bush to abandon his threat to veto legislation extending the Children's Health Insurance Program - or to round up enough votes in Congress to pass the bill over Bush's objection. ""It is hard for me to begin to understand how this president can be threatening to veto this legislation,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said. ""We hear a lot about family values. Well, if taking care of our children is not a family value then I don't know what is."" You can help. Sign the online petition. Tell the president to sign the Children's Health Insurance Program bill. 
   The program covers about 6 million children who are low-income but not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. The expansion would result in about 5.8 million additional children enrolling in Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid.
   In Vermont, the legislation would save health insurance for more than 2,000 Vermont children who would lose coverage under new rules announced by the Bush administration and cover more Vermont kids now without insurance. 
   ""I find it ironic that the American people seem to get from the White House what they don't want, and they don't get what they do want,"" Sanders told colleagues in a Senate floor statement. ""The American people want to end the war in Iraq as soon as possible, a war which will soon be costing us, if you can believe it, $750 billion?On the other hand, the American people do want health insurance for their children. The American people strongly support the Children's Health Insurance Program. That's what they want, but that's what they're not getting.""

41,   Obama  Bond  Boxer  McCaskill  Murray  Lieberman Introduce Amendment to Temporarily Cease Military Personality Disorder Discharges   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Bond  Boxer  McCaskill  Murray  Lieberman Introduce Amendment to Temporarily Cease Military Personality Disorder Discharges Thursday  July 12  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                      CONTACT  Ben LaBolt      Legislation calls for moratorium until comprehensive review of personality disorder discharge procedures WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Christopher Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Patty Murray  D WA  today introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that would temporarily suspend the Pentagon   s use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and an establishment of an independent discharge review board   Recent reports suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has inappropriately and inconsistently used personality disorder discharges to swiftly discharge members of the armed forces with service connected injuries such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and Traumatic Brain Injuries  TBIs     Such discharges can result in the loss of needed healthcare benefits from the VA as well as the repayment of enlistment bonuses  which can send injured service members and their families into debilitating debt     Given the thousands of American service members currently suffering from service connected psychological injuries  reports that the Department of Defense may be improperly diagnosing service members with personality disorders are deeply troubling     said Senator Obama      Given the lasting consequences of a personality disorder discharge  even one misdiagnosis is one too many   This amendment will force the Department of Defense to suspend its use of this discharge procedure until Secretary Gates can conduct a comprehensive review of these policies and establish a review board to ensure our service members have recourse when their cases are in doubt   It is our moral obligation to ensure that our service members receive the treatment  care  and benefits they deserve   That   s one thing about this war we can still get right         Abuse of personality disorder discharges is inexcusable   This amendment will put a stop to these discharges until we can fix the system     said Senator Bond      The men and women who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom have earned a debt of gratitude from all Americans that we will never be able to pay in full   The very least we can do is take care of their battle wounds  whether physical or mental  and ensure they receive the treatment and benefits they deserve     Senator Boxer said   It is unconscionable that some of our brave servicemen and women  including those suffering from PTSD and other mental health problems  may be receiving improper discharges for personality disorders and  in turn  denied disability benefits and guaranteed care from the Department of Veterans Affairs   This amendment halts these discharges until measures are put in place to ensure they are handled properly   We owe our brave service men and women nothing less      We have no greater obligation to those who serve our country in the Armed Services than to ensure they get the care they   ve been promised     McCaskill said     We cannot stand tall and proud as Americans if we allow one single service member to go without the benefits they deserve due to a misdiagnosis  Far too many combat troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan are returning with mental health injuries that bear the potential for misdiagnosis  and we need to do all we can to prevent that from occurring        We need to take a    time out    on these discharges and get the facts  We need ensure these discharges are medically accurate and that service members are not being denied the treatment or benefits they deserve     Senator Murray said  This amendment mandates a temporary moratorium on personality disorder discharges until the Department of Defense conducts a proper review and revision of its current policies and procedures related to this diagnosis   It also gives the DOD flexibility by granting an exception to the moratorium in those cases in which a service member provides false or misleading information  or omits information about past criminal behavior during the recruitment or enlistment process   The moratorium would be lifted after the DOD reviews its current policies  ensures it is following standard clinical diagnostic practices  and has established an independent review board to ensure that service members who have received this diagnosis may seek a review  On June 21  2007  Senators Bond  Boxer  Obama  Lieberman  McCaskill  Murray  and twenty five other Democratic and Republican senators wrote to Secretary Gates to express concern over continuing reports that personality disorder discharges were being implemented improperly  Over the last six years  Defense Department records indicate that over 22 500 personality disorder discharges have been processed  or on average 10 service members have been discharged per day  every day in that time                                   ,1
1791,"SEN. SANDERS SUPPORTS TROOPS
  Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday cosponsored legislation to require the Pentagon to let active duty troops returning from battle in Iraq and Afghanistan stay home at least as long a their tour of duty lasted in the war zones. Also under the measure no reservists or National Guard members could be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of a previous deployment. ""The war in Iraq has been devastating in so many ways to our troops and their families,"" Sanders said. ""It is unconscionable that we are shipping off to war, over and over again, the same troops from units that already have been stretched too thin."" 
   Sanders cosponsored the amendment introduced by Sen. James Webb, a Vietnam veteran and former Navy secretary. The full Senate was expected to debate the legislation as early as this week when it takes up a major Defense Department policy bill.
   Speaking at a Capitol press conference before a group of 40 veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, Sanders said, ""Passing the Webb Amendment is an important step forward.""
   Pentagon policy now calls for active-duty Army units to get one year at home for every 15 months deployed. Individual soldiers who may have been transferred from other units, however, may be sent back on a faster timetable.
   ""I come from a small state, the State of Vermont, which I believe has lost more soldiers per capita than any other state in this country, so we know the costs of this war and we know the courage of the men and women and we thank you very much for all that you have done in battle and equally important for?standing up for this country,"" Sanders said.

1739,"SEN. SANDERS SEEKS TO DOUBLE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS FUNDING
  The number of primary-care physicians and other health professionals trained in the United States is shrinking, according to Government Accountability Office findings announced today at a Senate hearing. 
   The nonpartisan research arm of Congress was asked to assess the state of primary-care training in the United States by Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the health committee chairman, and by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
   ""The health of our nation depends on a strong primary-care system. There are too many communities that lack affordable, quality primary-care services,"" Kennedy said. ""We must take the necessary steps to make sure that all Americans have access to primary-care physicians and other providers. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue in our committee this year."" 
   ""It is beyond comprehension that the richest nation in the history of the world is not able to graduate the kinds of health professionals we need,"" Sanders said.
   The number of U.S. medical school graduates enrolled in primary-care residency programs - such as family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics - fell to 22,146 in 2006 from 23,801 in 1995, according to the findings presented to the Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee. 
   Although the number of foreign-trained, primary-care physicians went up, Sanders called the decline in the number of Americans pursuing the specialty ""troubling."" 
   He proposed doubling funds for the National Health Service Corps to $250 million next year. ""Part of the solution lies in making medical, dental, and nursing education affordable for all Americans,"" he added.
   In presenting the findings to the Senate health committee, GAO Health Care Director A. Bruce Steinwald testified that there is ""a growing recognition that greater use of primary-care services and less reliance on specialty services can lead to better health outcomes at lower cost.""

1055,September 13  2006 Senator Clinton Urges VA Secretary to Commit to Keeping Canandaigua VAMC Open                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Community concerned about lack of communication from federal officials while VA Secretary announces that other New York facilities will remain open   Clinton reiterates call for VA Secretary to heed the recommendations of CARES report and keep Canandaigua facility open                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Amidst continuing community concern  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on Veterans   Affairs  VA  Secretary Jim Nicholson to provide an immediate update on the status of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  VAMC    In a letter to Secretary Nicholson  Senator Clinton notes that the Secretary has begun to make announcements about other VA facilities around the state and says she hopes that he will soon make a similar announcement about Canandaigua  During her recent visit to Canandaigua  Senator Clinton heard directly from local leaders who continue to be concerned about the lack of information that has been forthcoming on the VA  s decision            It has been over a year since the last Local Advisory Panel Meeting regarding the future of the Canandaigua VA and no clear indications have been given to the community about a timetable for a decision or about the decision itself  The VA still has not given any indication as to which plan they prefer out of the eight that were submitted and while the community appreciates the designation of the facility as a Center for Excellence  it remains unknown what  if any  impact this will have on the final decision     said Senator Clinton following the release of her letter          In her letter to Secretary Nicholson  Senator Clinton reiterates her concern that the voices of New York veterans directly affected by his decisions had not been sufficiently heard   The Senator also calls on the Secretary to heed the 2004 recommendations of the VA s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  process and the views of the Canandaigua Local Advisory Panel to retain the critical veterans  health care services provided by the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  VAMC             I urge Secretary Nicholson to give the CARES mandate and the concerns of the Local Advisory Panel his full consideration when coming to a decision about the future of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center   I hope Secretary Nicholson uses this opportunity to reaffirm the 2004 CARES Commission decision recommendation  which called for maintaining VA facilities in Canandaigua  including nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation  gero psychiatric services and hospice care   I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of veterans in New York and around the Nation who are depending on us to keep the commitment we have made to them     said Senator Clinton            The 2004 CARES decision for Canandaigua indicated that            The facility should remain open          The Master Plan will include construction of a new multi specialty outpatient clinic and nursing home complex to replace the patient care facilities currently located on the Canandaigua campus          The new nursing home complex will accommodate nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation patients and will provide gero psychiatric services and hospice care          These new facilities will ensure that Canandaigua veterans are treated in modern  state of the art facilities designed for provision of quality health care and built to more effectively meet their needs  and         The new facilities will remain in Canandaigua and be incorporated into the Master Plan          A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached       The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20420    Dear Mr  Secretary     I write with great interest regarding the current status of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  VAMC  within the CARES process   Given your recent and welcome decision to retain the existing VAMC  s in Manhattan and Brooklyn  I am hopeful that there will be a similar outcome for the facilities in Canandaigua   As you know  the Canandaigua VAMC has provided superb health care to veterans in Central New York since the 1930  s            In May 2004  the CARES decision for Canandaigua indicated that the facility should remain open   Specifically  it stated    The Master Plan will include construction of a new multi specialty outpatient clinic and nursing home complex to replace the patient care facilities currently located on the Canandaigua campus   The new nursing home complex will accommodate nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation patients and will provide gero psychiatric services and hospice care   These new facilities will ensure that Canandaigua veterans are treated in modern  state of the art facilities designed for provision of quality health care and built to more effectively meet their needs   The new facilities will remain in Canandaigua and be incorporated into the Master Plan             In August 2005  the Local Advisory Panel heard eight business plan options for the future of the Canandaigua campus   All eight recommended maintaining facilities in Canandaigua    none called for closure   Unfortunately  no further Local Advisory Panel meetings have occurred since last August  In April of this year  amid concerns that the VA was not fully engaging the Local Advisory Panel and New York veterans vested in the future of Canandaigua  I asked that you ensure that their views and recommendations would be considered as part of the CARES process   Additionally  I was concerned that the needs of our newest veterans were not being thoroughly evaluated and accounted for in your final recommendations   In your response of May 19  2006  you stated that Stage 1 was complete  but that   the LAP and stakeholders will have an opportunity to review the Stage 2 analysis    and make recommendations    prior to final decision               Since you have already begun to announce the disposition of sites under the CARES process  I urge you to give the CARES mandate and the concerns of the Local Advisory Panel your full consideration when coming to a decision about the future of the Canandaigua VAMC   I also request that you reaffirm the 2004 CARES Commission decision recommendation regarding Canandaigua as which called for maintaining VA facilities there including nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation  gero psychiatric services and hospice care   I look forward to an update on the future of these facilities and to working with you on behalf of veterans in New York and around this Nation who are depending on us to keep the commitment our Nation has made to them               Sincerely yours

Ambassadorial Nominees before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Tuesday  April  8  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today made the following statement on the ambassadorial nominees before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   Earlier today  Senator Obama chaired the nominations hearing of  The Honorable Barbara McConnell Barrett to be Ambassador to the Republic of Finland The Honorable Yousif Boutrous Ghafari to be Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia Mr  Frank Urbancic  Jr  to be Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus Ms  Nancy E  McEldowney to be Ambassador to the Republic of Bulgaria Mr  Kurt D  Volker to be U S  Permanent Representative on the Council of NATO Prepared remarks provided below  Today  the Committee meets to consider the nomination of five important diplomatic positions   The President has nominated Barbara McConnell Barrett to be Ambassador to the Republic of Finland  Yousif Boutrous Ghafari to be Ambassador to the Republic of Slovenia  Frank Urbancic  Jr  to be Ambassador to the Republic of Cyprus  Nancy McEldowney to be Ambassador to the Republic of Bulgaria  and Kurt Volker to be the U S  Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization    I am very pleased to welcome each of our nominees today   Without exception  you bring an impressive range of talents and experience to your assignments    I look forward to discussing the challenges you are likely to encounter and how you intend to strengthen our nation and its allies in the course of your service  Your nominations come at a critical moment in the history of American diplomacy   The challenges we face are formidable  securing our country  revitalizing our alliances  bolstering young democracies  and confronting the common threats of the 21st century   terrorism and nuclear weapons  climate change and poverty  genocide and disease   Turning these challenges into opportunities will require renewed American leadership   It will also require ambassadors who exemplify the principles that make our nation great    Upon confirmation  each of you will work with countries that are close partners of the United States and share our common faith in the value of self determination  accountable governments  collective security  and human rights   Mr  Volker  if confirmed  will serve as the United States  permanent representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization   NATO is the most powerful and most successful military alliance in the history of the world   No organization has done more to promote peace and security in Europe  or to create the protective shield that has allowed the democracies of the North Atlantic to grow into a free and prosperous community    But  as we saw at last week s summit in Bucharest  NATO is not as strong  as capable  or as united as it should be   Afghanistan  NATO s first major mission beyond the borders of Europe  has been overlooked and undermanned by many members of the alliance  including the United States  Success in Afghanistan is critical to American national security  and to the security of the entire world   And a failure there would not only endanger our nation and global stability   it would cast serious doubt on the ability of NATO s military and political architecture to uphold our security in the 21st century    Some new troop commitments to Afghanistan were made in Bucharest  and that is good news   But neither the Administration nor our allies have yet done enough to muster the resources that would win the war there and prevent Afghanistan from reemerging as a safe haven for the Taliban and al Qaeda   The Bucharest summit also left out one of three candidates for membership  and failed to provide the young democracies of Georgia and Ukraine with membership action plans   Mr  Volker  you are a professional diplomat of the first order and I have confidence that you will represent the United States ably in Brussels   However  ensuring that NATO retains its rightful place as the cornerstone of the Euro Atlantic alliance will require that we do more to enlarge NATO to include worthy European democracies  and focus more resources on the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda   Doing so will require adroit diplomacy at NATO headquarters  but it will also mean making the case directly to the citizens of Europe that we must all increase our commitment to global security  We succeeded in coming together to confront the greatest challenges of the second half of the 20th century  We cannot succeed in confronting the challenges of the 21st unless we do so together   Mr  Urbancic  if confirmed you will be serving in Cyprus at a time of new optimism in the long struggle to bring an end to the estrangement of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities   After three decades  last Thursday s opening of the Ledra Street crossing in downtown Nicosia was a tangible indication of good will on both sides of the island to forge a settlement between two peoples who share a common home  a common history  and a common destiny   I hope that the day of Cypriot reunification comes in the course of your ambassadorial service  and that you will do everything in your power to help the Republic of Cyprus and the Turkish Cypriot community reach a just and lasting peace    Slovenia has been on the cutting edge of democratic change in Eastern Europe   Since its early success gaining membership in NATO and the European Union  it has been a model for progress in the Balkans   Despite its small size  Slovenia currently leads the nations of the European Union while it occupies the EU s presidency   Its citizens are helping to set the agenda for an entire continent   Slovenians are focusing Europe s attention on the unfinished business of bringing peace and prosperity to the Balkans   The people and government of Slovenia will need the help of the United States and other partners as they consolidate their democratic gains  and seek to extend those gains throughout the region  Mr  Ghafari  as an immigrant who has truly lived the American dream  you represent the strength found in our country s diversity   Similar strength should characterize life in the Balkans   in some parts of the region including Slovenia  it already does   I hope your story and your service will resonate with people throughout the former Yugoslavia  After a difficult transition from communism and setbacks in the 1990s  Bulgaria has made impressive economic strides in recent years   As a potential hub for oil and gas distribution  the country could play an important role in Europe s future energy security   However  Bulgaria continues to struggle with corruption and the corrosive influence of organized crime   Any failure to address these challenges could jeopardize the country s future cooperation with the European Union and  with it  much of the progress that has occurred in the recent past  Ms  McEldowney  you will need to work aggressively to assure that the democratic backsliding which has happened in some other parts of Eastern Europe does not occur in Bulgaria   The country s institutions and judicial system will need your support and assistance in order to help Bulgaria remain on course toward full Euro Atlantic integration   In recent years  the United States has dramatically reduced its financial assistance to Bulgaria  so you ll have to be creative   But your exemplary record as a member of the Foreign Service bodes well for your work on these critical tasks    Finally  Ms  Barrett  you have a different task  as you will represent America in a country that has travelled further down the path of democracy and prosperity   Finland is a world leader in technology and innovation  and even outranks the United States in some measures of development    But it still faces challenges in its relationship with Russia and its longstanding position outside of Euro Atlantic security institutions   At some point soon  Finland may move toward membership in NATO   Should the Finish people and government chose to pursue that objective  I hope you will be their biggest booster  All of you are coming before this Committee at a defining moment in America s story   Now is not a time for half hearted diplomacy   We need to raise the bar for our allies and that must begin with raising the bar for ourselves   Together with our partners in Europe  I am confident that we can make whole a world that is in need of repair    I look forward to a more detailed discussion of the challenges and opportunities that await you

1209,May 15  2006 Senator Clinton Calls For Student Borrower Bill Of Rights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Brookville  NY   Today in her commencement address at the C W  Post Campus of Long Island University  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton reiterated her call for legislation that she will introduce to protect the rights of student borrowers trying to repay their loans  The Senator s Student Borrower Bill of Rights aims to provide student borrowers with basic rights so that there is increased transparency in student borrowing  so that loan payments are affordable  so that students can shop for loans in a free marketplace  and so that students have timely information about their loans  The bill will also increase education for students and parents on their rights as borrowers            I have heard from too many students across New York that they are overly burdened or treated unfairly as they repay student loans     said Senator Clinton    Student borrowers should know that the process won  t be burdensome and that they  ll be treated fairly             Students are borrowing now more than ever to pay for higher education   Need based grant aid has stagnated while college costs have grown  The result is more students borrowing and higher levels of borrowing  In 1993  less than one half of students graduating from four year colleges and universities had student loans   Now two thirds do  Over the past decade  the average debt burden for college graduates has increased 58 percent  after accounting for inflation          When student loans are burdensome  borrowers may be unable to buy a home   They may avoid important but low paying professions  such as public health workers  social workers  and teachers   The burden of student loans also prevents college graduates from pursuing a higher degree   According to studies by the Nellie Mae Corporation  40 percent of college graduates who do not go to graduate school  blame student loan debt   Today 54 percent of former students wish they had borrowed less for college  an increase from 31 percent in 1991   The prospect that student loans will be a great burden may also prevent successful high school students from going to college  20 percent of low income high school graduates qualified for college  do not go to college          Senator Clinton  s legislation is aimed at making it easier for students to repay and at giving them rights that are enforceable  The bill would give them the right to fair  monthly payments that do not exceed a certain percentage of their incomes and fair interest rates and fees  Too many students are seeing their costs go up after they think they  ve already budgeted for what they can pay  The bill would also give them the right to be able to borrow without exploitation  Finally  the bill aims at giving students access to better information about loans and more information that will give them better options          ,0
1779,"SEN. SANDERS JOINED PRESS CONFERENCE AT BURLINGTON OFFICE BY ED LAVILETTA, ASIAT ALI, MILT WILLIS OF AMERICAN LEGION
  Legislation moving through Congress would provide record-levels of support for veterans. The Senate earlier this month approved the greatest increase in veterans' health care in history, an increase of $3.6 billion over the past year. The House has passed similar legislation. Senator Bernie Sanders was joined Monday at a press conference in his Burlington office by Ed Laviletta, national legislative officer for the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Vermont, Asiat Ali, representing the Disabled American Veterans, and Milt Willis of the American Legion.
   ""I have believed for a long time that the United States government must keep the promises that it made to its veterans. This is especially true today - given the 27,000 soldiers who have been wounded in Iraq and the many more coming home with PTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury. But it is equally true for the men and women who fought in the first Gulf War, who fought in Vietnam, who fought in Korea and who fought in WWII as well as our other conflicts. What we must understand, now and forever, is that taking care of veterans is a cost of war - and that it must be built into the financial equation of any war and any military budget,"" Sanders said. 
   ""As a member of the Veterans Committee and the Budget Committee I am pleased that Congress is finally beginning to move us in that direction. It is finally beginning to keep faith with veterans. On September 6, the Senate approved the largest increase in veterans' benefits spending in the VA's 77-year history - an increase that amounts to $3.6 billion more than last year's level. The overall VA budget has gone from $79.5 billion in FY 2007 to $87.5 this year, an increase, incidentally, which is $3.6 billion higher than the president requested.
   ""The House has passed similar legislation seeking $87.6 billion. In the next few weeks these two very similar pieces of legislation will be reconciled in a conference committee. It is my hope that we get this legislation to the president as soon as possible.
   ""It is important to note that when Congress first proposed these huge increases for veterans' healthcare and benefits earlier this year, the president threatened to veto the legislation. Too much money for veterans I guess. After a few days of saying that, the president may have realized that we are in a war and we have hundreds of thousands of veterans that need help and he withdrew his veto threat.
   ""For the first time ever, the level of funding provided by Congress will match the levels proposed by the veteran organizations themselves in their Independent Budget.
   ""Let me take this opportunity to thank all of the veterans organizations, The VFW, the American Legion, the DAV, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS and many others for all the help they gave my office and the Veterans Affairs and Appropriations Committees in developing this legislation.
   ""Here is what this additional funding will mean as far as improvements for veterans' care:
   ""Just last week, we found out that the VA underreported the number of veterans that it had on its waiting lists last year by more than 53,000 people. The average wait time for a veteran's claim to be processed is 177 days, almost six months, and the department has a current backlog of almost 400,000 claims. At a time when veterans in Vermont and around the country too often have unacceptably long waiting times in order to get into a VA hospital or a clinic, this new funding will give the VA the resources it needs to decrease waiting times through more staff, improved training, and greater use if technology.
   ""The VA also will have the necessary resources to address the needs of returning veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan. Importantly, new investments are being made to treat Traumatic Brain Injury, which is the signature injury of this conflict, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. We know from media reports that 125,000 to 150,000 U.S. troops may have suffered brain injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan. The number is far higher than what the official casualty figures of 26,000 tell us.
   ""In addition, the Defense Department's Task Force on Mental Health tells us in its study that it found 38 percent of Soldiers and 31 percent of Marines report psychological concerns such as traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from deployment. And among members of the National Guard, the figure is much higher - 49 percent - with numbers expected to grow because of repeated deployments.
   ""Another report from the Department of Veterans Affairs says that 52,375 veterans who fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, and are now home, have been treated or evaluated for PTSD by the department. Clearly there is a great need out there and it is only growing.
   ""The bill provides $28.979 billion for VA medical services, which is $1.8 billion above the requested amount and represents an increase of $3.46 billion over Fiscal Year 2007 funding. This will go to the important and urgent work of researching and treating TBI and PTSD, in addition to other counseling and mental health needs.
   ""Also very important is that this bill will provide an increase in funding to give the VA the approximately $1.2 billion in resources it says it needs to treat all veterans, including the 1.5 million Category 8 veterans that President Bush has barred from the VA.
   ""Once this bill becomes law later this month there will no longer be any excuse for continuing to deny Category 8 veterans the VA health care they have earned through their service.
   ""This brings up a larger point that I want to touch on for a moment. We must make sure that as we provide top-notch care to our veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan we do not undermine the care and service our current veterans receive. The VA needs to set the goal and request the funds to meet the goal that every veteran, no matter what war or age, has comprehensive top-notch care with no waiting lines. We can not have a rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul situation where the care for one group of veterans forces the care of others to go down. All our veterans deserve the best care our country can provide. That is my goal and the funding for the VA coming out of Congress can help make that happen.
   ""In addition to providing the funding needed to eliminate the ban on Category 8's, this legislation rejects each of the Bush administration's proposals to increase fees on some veterans such as increasing the prescription drug co-payments from $8 to $15 and imposing an annual enrollment fee of $250-$750. These proposals, which would have driven many veterans out of the VA, are thankfully dead for another year.
   ""The spending bill also put over $85 million additional into medical and prosthetic research at the VA, including $15 million for continuing work on Gulf War Illness. The total $500 million for medical and prosthetic research is $85 million fiscal year 2007 enacted level and $89 million above the president's request.
   ""Finally, I added an amendment to this spending bill on the floor of the Senate - which was adopted unanimously by voice vote - to rectify another insult to our veterans. Many people may not know this but every year when the government adjusts disabled veterans compensation by whatever the cost of living allowance is, the government then rounds that amount to the next lowest dollar. So, for example, if a disabled veteran is entitled to $200.99, the veteran only receives this $200. This so-called 'rounding down' was originally imposed as a short-term budget saver and now amounts to a $20 million-a-year reduction in disability compensation and other veterans benefits such as the clothing allowance that some veterans receive because their clothes wear out more quickly because of the use of a wheel-chair or prosthetic device.
   ""What an insult to those veterans who have sacrificed more than anyone could. Well, with the support of the American Legions, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and AMVETS, I brought an amendment to the floor of the Senate that would eliminate this rounding down, that would say loud and clear that it is wrong to try to balance the budget on the backs of our disabled veterans, especially at a time when the Bush administration has given hundreds of billions of tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country. The Senate has accepted this amendment and I am going to push to make sure that it becomes law.
   ""Let me conclude by saying the good news is that the Congress is making great strides in the effort to keep faith with our veterans. As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I am happy to be in the middle of that fight and to be working with our nation's veterans and with veterans here in Vermont to keep the ball moving forward.
   ""All across the country there are veterans and their families who, as a result of their service to the nation, are experiencing health problems or financial problems.

1948,"THE CRISIS OF SHRINKING MIDDLE CLASS
  As the Senate renews debate this week on immigration reform legislation and considers the implications for American workers, two timely studies document the shrinking middle class and the growing gap between the rich and the rest of us. To help address that situation, the Senate last week overwhelmingly passed a Sanders' amendment to the immigration bill to provide scholarships for Americans studying math, engineering, health care and computer science. The Sanders scholarships would be funded by a small fee on businesses who recruit skilled workers from other countries to work in the United States for less than Americans are paid to do the same jobs. 
   ""The great economic crisis facing the United States is the shrinking of the middle class and the loss of millions of good paying jobs,"" Sanders said. ""We must do everything that we can to reverse that trend and make sure that good-paying professional jobs in this country are filled by Americans, not by people brought in from other countries by corporate interests."" 
   According to one recent study, men in their 30s make less money now than their fathers did at the same age. In 2004, the median income for a man in his 30s was $35,010. That's 12 percent less, adjusted for inflation, than what men the same age were making in 1974, according to economists at the Brookings Institution and Pew Charitable Trust.
   Another study that bolsters Sanders' case concluded that average earnings of American workers with an undergraduate degree have not kept up with productivity gains. Massachusetts Institute of Technology economists Frank Levy and Peter Temin showed that while graduates certainly did better than non-graduates in recent decades, the average graduate failed to keep up with gains in economy-wide productivity. They presented their study on Tuesday to the New America Foundation.

1868,"SENS. LEAHY, SANDERS AGAIN PUSH FOR WITHDRAWAL OF U.S. TROOPS FROM IRAQ
  The U.S. Senate Tuesday will vote on legislation cosponsored by Vermont's two U.S. Senators to begin withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq.  
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) are original cosponsors of a bill introduced by Sen. Russell Feingold (D-Wisc.) and Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that would cut off funding for the military mission in Iraq four months after passage, with exceptions for counterterrorism, troop training and other limited purposes. Leahy and Sanders have joined with Feingold each time similar legislation to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq has been offered, and Rep. Peter Welch (D) has supported counterpart legislation in the House. They succeeded in attaching troop withdrawal legislation to last year's Iraq spending bill, but it was vetoed by the President. 
   The Bush Administration and Senate Republicans are working hard to defeat the new Iraq withdrawal bill and are forcing a supermajority test requiring 60 votes. Leahy and Sanders acknowledge that the bill faces steep odds. [The votes are expected to begin at approximately 3 p.m. Tuesday.]
   Leahy said, ""The Bush Administration's failed policy in Iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point, diluted and diverted our efforts to counter al Qaeda and its affiliates in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and roiled the Middle East with instability. The sooner we change course the sooner we can implement a sound, sensible and sustainable policy that truly advances our security interests.""
   Sanders said, ""At a time when we have a $9 trillion national debt and enormous unmet needs in this country, this war continues to cost us an astronomical $12 billion each and every month. We should stop the war, stop the bloodshed, rebuild our credibility around the world, and reorder or priorities at home.""
   A separate bill coming to a Senate vote Tuesday would require the Bush Administration to produce a global strategy for defeating al Qaeda and its affiliates. That strategy must ensure that deployments do not undermine military readiness or homeland security.

375,   Obama Joins Kennedy  Lewis to Introduce Civil Rights Act of 2008   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Kennedy  Lewis to Introduce Civil Rights Act of 2008 Thursday  January 24  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                            CONTACT  Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  WASHINGTON  DC   Today  Senator Edward M  Kennedy and Congressman John Lewis  along with more than a dozen Senate colleagues  introduced the Civil Rights Act of 2008  which will strengthen accountability when civil rights and workers  rights are violated   Recent court decisions have weakened America s civil rights laws in ways that Congress never intended   This legislation will ensure accountability for violations of our civil rights and fair labor laws and give individuals the right to challenge practices that have unjustified discriminatory effect based on race  color  national origin  disability  age or gender  It also gives students the same protection from harassment in school that workers have on the job  and holds employers fully accountable for age discrimination and discrimination against our men and women in the armed services   The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is co sponsored by Senators Leahy  Dodd  Lautenberg  Bingaman  Kerry  Harkin  Mikulski  Akaka  Boxer  Feingold  Murray  Durbin  Schumer  Cantwell  Clinton  Obama  Menendez  Cardin  and Brown   Senator Kennedy said   Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America   Prejudice  discrimination  and outright bigotry continue to limit the lives of large numbers of our people  and even some courts have rolled back core protections for civil rights and workers  rights  The Civil Rights Act of 2008 will restore the bedrock principle that individuals may challenge all forms of discrimination in public services and will strengthen existing civil rights protections   Our civil rights and fair labor laws must have effective remedies that ensure accountability for discrimination  or America will never be America    The struggle for civil rights in this country   said Rep  John Lewis   has been a long hard road  littered with the broken bodies of countless men and women who gave all they had for the cause of social justice    They were sharecroppers  sanitation workers  teachers  students  ministers  priests  housewives  and activists   They were ordinary people with extraordinary vision who joined together and tore down the walls of legalized segregation and racial discrimination in this country   Only a few decades later  we cannot allow recent court decisions to turn back the clock and open the door to contemporary abuses   That is why Sen  Kennedy and I have worked so hard to meet every judicial step backward with a legislative step forward   We want to be able to say that on our watch  we did all we could as members of Congress to ensure the protection of civil rights in this country and hold discriminatory employers and individuals accountable   With the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 2008  we hope the 110th Congress will hold the same legacy  as a legislative body that continued the march toward a democracy in this country that ensures liberty and justice for all    I have been a long time supporter of efforts to rid the workplace of unlawful discrimination  and I believe the Civil Rights Act of 2008 is critical to achieving that important goal   said Leahy    This bill ensures that protections against workplace bias and discrimination  which conservative courts have attempted to roll back  are fully protected and restored   It is particularly important that  on the week that our nation observes and honors the legacy of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   Congress has introduced this bill   We must remain vigilant in ensuring our precious civil rights  which generations of Americans fought and bled to protect  remain available for our children and our grandchildren   I will continue to fight to end all workplace discrimination  including discrimination based on sexual orientation    The best way to honor the memory of Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr  is to continue his work to ensure that America lives up to its promise of treating all citizens equally   said Dodd    The fight for civil rights will not be won or lost in a single battle  but instead is an ongoing struggle taking place in our workplaces  schools  and communities across the nation   I am honored to join Senator Kennedy and my colleagues in the Senate and Congressman John Lewis in the House of Representatives in introducing a bill that will give Americans the tools and support they need to defend themselves and others when their civil rights have been violated    We need to put teeth back in our civil rights laws   Senator Frank R  Lautenberg said    This bill would reaffirm the basic American value that everyone  regardless of race  gender or age  should have the same opportunities to succeed    This legislation is an important step in restoring the ability of Americans to protect their civil rights in courts   U S  Senator Jeff Bingaman said     I am proud to stand with Senator Kennedy and our colleagues to stop the assault on civil rights in our country   said Sen  Kerry   Too many brave Americans marched  fought  and faced down snarling dogs and fire hoses in the struggle for civil rights to have decades of progress erased by a few misguided decisions made by conservative judges   Our country is great because we believe in Jefferson s promise of God given inalienable rights for every citizen  and because we know it takes a government committed to protecting them to make the promise of civil rights real for the American people    Over 40 years ago Congress made it clear that discrimination is unacceptable in this country   said Harkin   In recent years however the Supreme Court has eroded these important laws and our action today is a first step towards restoring crucial civil rights protections in order to stamp out bigotry and injustice    The Supreme Court s decision in Alexander v  Sandoval sent a dangerous message about equity in this country   I am proud to team up with my colleagues to right this wrong   said Senator Mikulski   We need to reexamine what this country must still do to make sure that all Americans are protected from discriminatory acts   This bill ensures that those who have received injustice in the workplace have their fair day in court    There is no better way of honoring the civil rights movement than by working to address the erosion of protections we see today   said Senator Murray  Chair of the HELP Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee   This bill restores many of our most basic civil rights by confronting threats on the job and in our schools  We cannot continue to allow students to be harassed  employment laws to be marginalized  and discrimination to go unpunished  I am proud to support Senator Kennedy and Rep  Lewis in this effort   Senator Schumer said   For too long  the Supreme Court s cramped interpretations of civil rights statutes have closed the doors of the federal courts to people with claims of discrimination  This important legislation will right the wrong of those decisions  and restore Congress s original intent to protect all citizens by holding accountable those that violate our cherished civil rights    In recent years  we have seen courts erode key civil rights protections in our workplaces  our schools and our communities   said Senator Clinton    This important bill will reverse a number of these troubling decisions  and restore the promise of our nation s civil rights laws for millions of Americans    Too many hardworking Americans continue to face discrimination and unfair employment practices  and we must do everything we can to guarantee that all Americans receive fair and equal treatment under the law   said Senator Obama    Civil rights have to be at the forefront of our national dialogue  and we must ensure that those who suffer discrimination  whether by the federal government or private employers  can protect themselves legally   The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is an important step in our continuing battle against age discrimination  religious discrimination  the misuse of federal funds  and upholding workers  rights   I commend Chairman Kennedy for his leadership on this bill   and for his lifelong leadership on these issues   and urge my colleagues to quickly pass this legislation    Just because the calendar says 2008 doesn t mean that the need to fight for civil rights in our country is over   said Sen  Menendez   This week  we all reflected on the legacy of Dr  Martin Luther King  and this legislation helps carry on that legacy  Federal tax dollars should never be used to discriminate against or disadvantage our citizens  It is our responsibility to sustain our commitment to civil rights  and with this legislation  we can restore some of the major civil rights principles that have been diluted  I applaud Senator Kennedy for his continued leadership on civil rights    Discrimination for any reason has no place in America  The Civil Rights Act of 2008 is essential to restoring the balance to our system that provides equal opportunity for every American   said Senator Cardin   There has been a growing disregard of the original intent of Congress by many conservative judges in the area of civil rights law  For many  this has eroded their chance at achieving the American Dream  I believe Congress must act to reverse this troubling trend    This legislation bolsters the rights of Americans by ensuring there are consequences when an individual s civil rights are breached   Brown said   It is a bill that honors our constitution  and I am proud to support it                                   Pursuant to  policy

  Global Warming Senator Frank Lautenberg and Sanders released a set of global warming principles in anticipation of a compromise measure offered by Senators Joseph Lieberman and John Warner. ""This is no time for timidity"" and ""dealing with scientific reality is more important than cutting deals,"" Sanders said. ""I hope we can work together, but I think we have a distance to go to make that legislation better, stronger, more consistent with the science that's out there,"" Congress Daily reported. In a Senate floor statement, Sanders added: ""The problem is even worse than many have previously suggested.  
 If anything, the legislation Senator Boxer and I introduced in January, the strongest legislation introduced in Congress to address global warming, is probably too conservative to address the problem. It is likely that we should be even more aggressive in our targets and timetables for mandatory reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."" In a Times Argus op-ed, Drew Hudson of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group wrote: ""When Congress acts, it must act to pass a strong bill with the reductions in global warming pollution that science tells us are necessary to prevent catastrophic effects of global warming. Luckily, Sanders is at the table right now developing the legislation that the Senate is expected to consider this fall. Sanders has been a leading advocate for meeting the challenge of global warming with a strong, science-based response. Now more than ever we're counting on Sen. Sanders to ensure that the United States takes bold action, starting now."" To read the column, visit[http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=285551].

   Intelligence Surveillance Senator Sanders said he would oppose legislation on intelligence surveillance in the United States that would grant telecommunications companies immunity from lawsuits over privacy rights violations. A bill approved on Thursday by the Senate Intelligence Committee would give telephone companies immunity from about 40 pending lawsuits over their role in a Bush administration surveillance program instituted after September 2001. ""Of course we have to do everything we can to protect the American people, but we must fight international terrorism in a way that is consistent with our Constitution and the Bill of Rights,"" Sanders said. In Vermont, the Public Service Board is considering a probe into whether Verizon Vermont and AT&T gave the National Security Agency access to Vermont residents' phone records as part of a surveillance program. In July, a federal judge in California refused to dismiss legal requests by Vermont and four other states for information on the program.
  Blackwater USA In Iraq alone, there are roughly 180,000 private contractors working for American government agencies, including about 30,000 heavily-armed guards. The most notorious contractor, Blackwater USA, has been embroiled in controversy over the deaths last month of 17 Iraqis. A State Department contract with the private security firm, which escorts U.S. diplomats traveling outside the heavily protected Green Zone in Baghdad, expires in May. The contract should not be renewed, Sanders said. ""The Bush administration has made radical and dangerous changes in the structure of our military, and Congress needs to take a very hard look at that. To my mind, it is wrong and unacceptable for companies like Blackwater to operate outside of the chain of command of the United States military and United States government in Iraq. I also find it troubling when personnel employed by a company like Blackwater are paid far more than soldiers in the U.S. military who are putting their lives on the line every day.""

   Prescription Drugs Legislation was introduced by Sanders on Friday that would eliminate market exclusivity for new drugs, but give developers large cash rewards from a ""Medical Innovation Prize Fund"" when products improved health outcomes. By eliminating monopolies and allowing generic competition, prices on drugs would fall dramatically, saving taxpayers, employers and consumers more than $200 billion per year. Under the proposal, the current patent system would still be used, but patent owners would no longer be given monopoly rights to control the manufacturing and sale of products. Instead, patents would be used to establish who ""owns"" the right to the cash rewards given for new inventions. Drugs developed without patents would also be eligible for the prizes. ""As health-care costs continue to spiral, our nation must focus debate on why prescription drugs cost so much. Unfortunately, Congress has never delved into why the process that brings new drugs to market is so insanely expensive, inefficient, and ineffective. Senator Sanders' bill, 'The Medical Innovation Prize Act of 2007,' could at long last begin that debate,"" said Bill Vaughan of Consumers Union.

   Children's Health In the battle of Bush vs. the children, the children lost when the House on Thursday upheld the president's veto of a bill to provide health insurance to 10 million children. Bipartisan supporters of the measure vowed to send it back to him next month, with minor changes. ""For now, the insurance vote stands as the latest example of how Mr. Bush can still get his way on Capitol Hill?through artful use of veto threats and his veto pen,"" The New York Times reported.

1974,"SEN. SANDERS PROPOSES NATIONAL PRIORITIES ACT
  Citing spiraling income disparity in America, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today introduced legislation to expand opportunities for the middle-class, lower the poverty rate and keep commitments to veterans, senior citizens, children's health care and other national priorities by repealing tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans while expanding tax relief for working families.
   Sanders' legislation, The National Priorities Act of 2007, also would redirect $60 billion in the Pentagon budget by ending outdated Cold War-era weapons programs and eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. The Pentagon provision would prohibit achieving any of the savings by shortchanging basic needs of military personnel, including pay raises and health care. 
   ""The Senate must pass a budget that will expand the shrinking middle class, reduce the enormous gap between the rich and the poor, keep our promises to our nation's veterans, reduce our record-breaking national debt and lower the poverty rate,"" Sanders said in a Senate floor speech. ""The best way to accomplish these goals is to repeal the president's tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent, eliminate waste, fraud and abuse at the Pentagon and use this revenue for the many unmet needs of this country.""
   A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders also proposed to devote a portion of the restored revenue - $30 billion - to reduce the federal deficit.
   A budget, Sanders told colleagues, ""is more than just a long list of numbers, it is a statement of our values and priorities. It is about taking a hard look at the needs of our people and prioritizing the budget in an intelligent and rational way.""
   The legislation detailed troubling economic trends in the United States, including the highest rate of poverty among 17 major countries in North America and Europe. The 36.9 million Americans living in poverty, the senator noted, rose by 5.4 million since President Bush took office.
   Sanders also cited the rising number of uninsured and homeless, shameful inattention to dental care for children in a nation where tooth decay has become the most chronic childhood disease, shortfalls in funding for veterans, and inadequate support for students from middle-class families confronted by skyrocketing college costs.
   While the middle class is shrinking and poverty is increasing, Sanders added, the wealthiest 1 percent at the very top of the economic ladder has not had it so good since the 1920s. According to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the richest 400 Americans increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 trillion. ""Sadly,"" Sanders said, ""the United States today has the most unfair distribution of wealth and income of any major country, and the gap between the very wealthy and everyone else is growing wider.""
   The cost of preserving Bush's tax cuts for the very richest in 2008 alone would total $70 billion - more than will be spent on homeland security, education, or veterans affairs. At the same time he would repeal tax cuts for the top 1 percent, Sanders would reduce taxes by $400 to $1,134 a year for 10 million American workers and families with children by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit.
   The priority programs authorized by the legislation would include:
   * $15 billion for children's health plans
   * $575 million for Community Health Centers
   * $140 million for the expansion of dental clinics in rural and under-served areas
   * $2.2 billion for child care
   * $14.9 billion for special education
   * $4 billion for veterans' health care
   * $7.2 billion for an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit
   * $16.2 billion to increase the maximum Pell Grant for college students
   * $15 billion in grants to states for educating students with disabilities
   * $27 billion for energy efficiency and conservation programs
   * $5 billion for housing

                      Legislation Included in Transportation  Housing and Urban Development Bill Approved by House Senate Conferees   Amendments Require Bush Administration to Develop Plan to Ease Congestion in NY NJ Philly Airspace                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  New Jersey and New Yorks U S  Senators announced today a House Senate Conference Committee has approved two measures they authored to reduce flight delays and ease congestion in the New York New Jersey airspace as part of the final Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies  TTHUD  FY08 Appropriations Bill   One amendment would require the federal government to provide a plan to Congress to reduce flight delays in the New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Region  the nations most densely congested airspace   The other amendment requires the investigative arm of Congress  the Government Accountability Office to investigate the Administrations Airspace Redesign Plan  as well as the effectiveness of a variety of approaches used nationwide to reduce flight delays  The Senators called for action after record airport delays this summer and amid major concerns that the Federal Aviation Administrations announced Airspace Redesign for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia area will increase aircraft noise while providing only minimal delay reductions    Were coming up on another busy holiday season full of exasperating lines and endless delays for the flying public  said Senator Menendez  who sponsored the amendment mandating a Government Accountability Office study of flight delay reduction options and co sponsored Senator Clintons amendment requiring a report from the Secretary of Transportation  Air travelers deserve relief from the worsening flight delays  and we are giving the administration a push toward taking action  It is important that these provisions are in the bill  and it is important that they become law  We need real solutions to give travelers relief from constant flight delays  said Senator Lautenberg   Our aviation system is a mess and the Bush Administrations congestion plan is no solution   It would create more aircraft noise in more neighborhoods throughout our region without providing relief from delays   Our measure would require a better study of how to improve flight delays without causing the excessive air noise that plagues so many communities  Reducing congestion and restoring order to our crowded skies is critical for our nations transportation system  for the safety and comfort of air travelers  and for the quality of life for our communities on the ground  This legislation will require the federal government to finally do the planning necessary to address the problems that plague our air transit system  including frustrating delays  chronic gridlock and excessive noise  Senator Clinton said  I am pleased that these amendments will be in the final version of the bill and I look forward to them becoming law  We need aggressive  comprehensive action to break the gridlock in our skies  and these amendments will force the FAA and administration to take a long  hard look at the process and potential pitfalls behind the FAAs long and short term plans  and produce real recommendations for how to fix our congested aviation system  Senator Schumer said  Details of the FAA Plan amendment Directs the GAO to conduct a study of the efficacy of various approaches used in the past by the FAA and the DOT to address delays at our nation s airports  Within 120 days of enactment  the GAO is to report which strategies have worked best to comprehensively reduce flight delays at an airport within 6 months or less  Specifically  the GAO is instructed to examine efforts by the FAA to induce voluntary schedule reductions at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  the FAA s mandatory flight reduction operations at LaGuardia International Airport and Reagan National Airport  the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area Airspace Redesign and any other significant efforts by the FAA or the DOT to reduce flight delays at a major U S  international airport  Details of the GAO amendment Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to Congress a report detailing how the Federal Aviation Administration plans to alleviate air congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace by August 31  2008  The report would have to be submitted to no later than 120 days after the enactment of the legislation  A Joint House Senate Conference Committee included the two amendments in the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation  Housing  and Urban Development Appropriations bill  which now goes to the full House and Senate for final approval before heading to the President for his signature

780,August 11  2006 Senator Clinton  Cornell Cooperative Extension and the New York Farm Bureau Foundation for Agricultural Education  Inc  Launch Emergency Forage Exchange to Assist Flood Affected Farmers in New York                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program will coordinate forage resources across the state to provide needed feed and forage to flood affected farmers in New York State      Program includes website of locally available forage resources and the NYFB Foundation  s Feed and Forage Transportation Fund                                                                                                                                    New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Cornell Cooperative Extension and the New York Farm Bureau Foundation for Agricultural Education  Inc  in launching an Emergency Forage Exchange and a Feed and Forage Transportation Fund to provide feed and cash assistance for farmers in New York State who have been severely impacted by the recent flooding          As part of the Emergency Forage Exchange  Senator Clinton s office worked in coordination with Cornell Cooperative Extension and the New York Farm Bureau Foundation for Agricultural Education  Inc   the   Foundation     to establish an Emergency Response Forage Exchange  http   emergencyresponse cce cornell edu   which includes an online database of forage resources available to farmers in New York State areas affected by the recent flooding   The Cornell Emergency Forage website will be maintained and updated by Cornell Cooperative Extension personnel and will help match regional forage availability with forage needs   It is not intended for merchandising and it is not intended for direct producer access or input   The website will be active through December 2006 at which point continuation will be reconsidered based on need   Farmers who wish to donate or sell forage and farmers who are in need of forage should call their local county Cornell Cooperative Extension office   Visit the Cornell Cooperative Extension website  http   www cce cornell edu in_your_community php  or call the state Cornell Cooperative Extension Administration Office at 607 255 2237 to find the Cornell Cooperative Extension office in your county            In addition to promoting the website  the Foundation has also created the Feed and Forage Transportation Fund to collect tax deductible donations to assist farmers who have lost feed and forage necessary to feed their livestock  Fund monies will be used to assist in underwriting the transportation costs of replacement feed and forage for eligible farmers   Farmers in need of assistance and those wishing to contribute to the fund should call the Foundation Office at  800  342 4143  Applications for assistance will be available on the Foundation website  www nyfbfoundation org   the New York Farm Bureau website  www nyfb org   or can be obtained from the Foundation Office  The deadline for applications is September 30  2006           In emergency situations such as the flooding that occurred in June  the Cornell Cooperative Extension system provides an important link that enables us to deliver resources of the land grant university to the people of New York   We are pleased to be working in collaboration with Senator Clinton s office and the New York Farm Bureau Foundation for Agricultural Education in this Emergency Response Forage Exchange effort   said Dr  Helene R  Dillard  Director of Cornell Cooperative Extension          Judi Whittaker  Chair of the Foundation Board said    As our farm is located in the flood region  I have seen the damage and devastation of the floods firsthand from day one   The cooperative efforts to provide help to those farmers who lost crops that would feed their herds are heartening to me   I applaud those who have provided donations thus far  and encourage others to provide what help they can to the Feed and Forage Transportation Fund               We are in a dire situation  with many of our farmers in the flood region losing a significant portion of their hay and corn for the year     said John Lincoln  president of New York Farm Bureau  board member of the Foundation  and a dairy farmer from Bloomfield  N Y     We are grateful to Senator Clinton and Cornell Cooperative Extension for recognizing the critical circumstances our farmers are facing   With the high costs of transportation  we expect that our Foundation  s  Feed and Forage Transportation Fund will be utilized to help offset the costs of trucking feed to the farmers who are most in need              Many farmers have suffered devastating losses from the recent flooding and this program will help them obtain critical resources to make it through the rest of this growing season   We need to continue to work together to help those that have suffered to get back on their feet   In New York State we are so fortunate to have such a strong agricultural community  the leadership of Cornell and the Farm Bureau  and the incredible willingness of farmers to help other farmers in this time of need   Senator Clinton said           Farms in Central and Eastern New York are continuing to experience the negative effects of a devastating growing season   In some areas  excessive spring rains delayed or prevented planting   Record setting heavy rains at the end of June and the severe flooding that followed resulted in severe crop losses  farmland damage and property damage to farmers in Central New York  the Mohawk Valley  the Western Catskills and the Southern Tier   Most recent estimates from the Farm Service Agency include severe crop losses in 20 counties on more than 290 000 acres at a value of over  40 2 million dollars            While all crop producers have suffered devastating losses  livestock and dairy farmers were especially hard hit  as corn and hay  which are critical for providing animal feed  accounted for over 90 percent of crop losses   Many farms have lost not only their planted crops  but stored and standing crops used for current feed supply as well   There is little doubt that many producers will face a major shortage of forages to feed their herds over the coming months   These farms face seemingly insurmountable challenges unless there is response and support from others          Farmers in the counties that have received disaster declarations by the Secretary of Agriculture   Broome  Chenango  Cortland  Delaware  Fulton  Greene  Hamilton  Herkimer  Madison  Montgomery  Oneida  Orange  Otsego  Rensselaer  Schenectady  Schoharie  Sullivan  Tioga  Tompkins  and Ulster   will be eligible to receive forage and or cash assistance   Farmers from any county can donate or offer to provide forage resources or cash donations through this program   Both donating and recipient farmers should contact their local Cornell Cooperative Extension Office or the Foundation for more information about the program            In addition to helping establish the Emergency Forage Exchange  last month Senator Clinton called on the USDA to provide for disaster assistance for flood affected farmers   Senator Clinton urged USDA to make adequate funding available for existing programs that are critical for helping farmers and communities recover from disaster events  such as the Emergency Watershed Protection Program  the Emergency Conservation Program and the Crop Disaster Program   She also called for consideration of a crop indemnity program similar to the one provided for farmers who suffered losses during Hurricane Katrina

Debunked Insight Magazine and Fox News Smear Campaign Tuesday  January 23  2007  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 23  2007  Debunked Insight Magazine and Fox News Smear Campaign In the past week  many of you have read a now thoroughly debunked story by Insight Magazine  owned by the Washington Times  which cites unnamed sources close to a political campaign that claim Senator Obama was enrolled for    at least four years    in an Indonesian    Madrassa     The article says the    sources    believe the Madrassa was    espousing Wahhabism     a form of radical Islam  Insight Magazine published these allegations without a single named source  and without doing any independent reporting to confirm or deny the allegations  Fox News quickly parroted the charges  and Fox and Friends host Steve Doocy went so far as to ask     Why didn   t anybody ever mention that that man right there was raised     spent the first decade of his life  raised by his Muslim father     as a Muslim and was educated in a Madrassa     All of the claims about Senator Obama raised in the Insight Magazine piece were thoroughly debunked by CNN  which  instead of relying on unnamed sources  sent a reporter to Obama   s former school in Jakarta to check the facts    Video   If Doocy or the staff at Fox and Friends had taken the time to check their facts  or simply made a call to his office  they would have learned that Senator Obama was not educated in a Madrassa  was not raised as a Muslim  and was not raised by his father     an atheist Obama met once in his life before he died  Later in the day  Fox News host John Gibson again discussed the Insight Magazine story without any attempt to independently confirm the charges  All of the claims about Senator Obama   s faith and education raised in the Insight Magazine story and repeated on Fox News are false  Senator Obama was raised in a secular household in Indonesia by his stepfather and mother  Obama   s stepfather worked for a U S  oil company  and sent his stepson to two years of Catholic school  as well as two years of public school  As Obama described it     Without the money to go to the international school that most expatriate children attended  I went to local Indonesian schools and ran the streets with the children of farmers  servants  tailors  and clerks      The Audacity of Hope  p  274  To be clear  Senator Obama has never been a Muslim  was not raised a Muslim  and is a committed Christian who attends the United Church of Christ in Chicago  Furthermore  the Indonesian school Obama attended in Jakarta is a public school that is not and never has been a Madrassa  These malicious  irresponsible charges are precisely the kind of politics the American people have grown

report about Obama Story Highlights     Report alleges Illinois senator attended radical Muslim school as a child     CNN reporter visits Indonesia school in question  sees no radicalism     Former classmate calls school  general   with multiple religions JAKARTA  Indonesia  CNN     Allegations that Sen  Barack Obama was educated in a radical Muslim school known as a  madrassa  are not accurate  according to CNN reporting  Insight Magazine  which is owned by the same company as The Washington Times  reported on its Web site last week that associates of Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton  D New York  had unearthed information the Illinois Democrat and likely presidential candidate attended a Muslim religious school known for teaching the most fundamentalist form of Islam  Obama lived in Indonesia as a child  from 1967 to 1971  with his mother and stepfather and has acknowledged attending a Muslim school  but an aide said it was not a madrassa   Watch video of Obama s school  Insight attributed the information in its article to an unnamed source  who said it was discovered by  researchers connected to Senator Clinton   A spokesman for Clinton  who is also weighing a White House bid  denied that the campaign was the source of the Obama claim  He called the story  an obvious right wing hit job   Insight stood by its story in a response posted on its Web site Monday afternoon  The Insight article was cited several times Friday on Fox News and was also referenced by the New York Post  The Glenn Beck program on CNN Headline News and a number of political blogs   Watch how the Obama  gossip  spread  School not a madrassa But reporting by CNN in Jakarta  Indonesia and Washington  D C   shows the allegations that Obama attended a madrassa to be false  CNN dispatched Senior International Correspondent John Vause to Jakarta to investigate  He visited the Basuki school  which Obama attended from 1969 to 1971   This is a public school  We don t focus on religion   Hardi Priyono  deputy headmaster of the Basuki school  told Vause   In our daily lives  we try to respect religion  but we don t give preferential treatment   Vause reported he saw boys and girls dressed in neat school uniforms playing outside the school  while teachers were dressed in Western style clothes   I came here to Barack Obama s elementary school in Jakarta looking for what some are calling an Islamic madrassa     like the ones that teach hate and violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan   Vause said on the  Situation Room  Monday   I ve been to those madrassas in Pakistan     this school is nothing like that   Vause also interviewed one of Obama s Basuki classmates  Bandug Winadijanto  who claims that not a lot has changed at the school since the two men were pupils  Insight reported that Obama s political opponents believed the school promoted Wahhabism  a fundamentalist form of Islam   and are seeking to prove it    It s not  an  Islamic school  It s general   Winadijanto said   There is a lot of Christians  Buddhists  also Confucian      So that s a mixed school   The Obama aide described Fox News  broadcasting of the Insight story  appallingly irresponsible   Fox News executive Bill Shine told CNN  Reliable Sources  anchor Howard Kurtz that some of the network s hosts were simply expressing their opinions and repeatedly cited Insight as the source of the allegations  Obama has noted in his two books   Dreams From My Father  and  The Audacity of Hope   that he spent two years in a Muslim school and another two years in a Catholic school while living in Indonesia from age 6 to 10                                    ,1
1653,February 1  2007 Senator Clinton Questions General George Casey Jr  on His Nomination to be United States Army Chief of Staff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator Clinton  Thank you Mr  Chairman and thanks to you General Casey for your years of service and thanks also to your family because they have served along with you and we  re grateful to all of you           I want to follow up on the line of questioning Senator Inhofe was perusing because I have been concerned about the readiness level of units being deployed to Iraq  And in last year  s Defense Authorization Bill  I authored an amendment that was included in the final bill that would require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of our ground forces within the Army and Marine Corps   no later than June 1 of this year           But even before that report is completed there have been a series of disturbing reports that our troops don  t have the equipment they need as they are being deployed to Iraq  At a January 23 House Armed Service Committee Hearing  General Schoomaker stated    We are in a dangerous  uncertain  and unpredictable time     And reiterated his concerns about the readiness levels of non deployed combat units   Five combat brigade teams are deploying to Iraq to support the proposed escalation of U S  forces there  These units are part of the pool of non deployed combat units            And General  I want to ask a series of questions that follow up on our conversation yesterday in my office because I know this is a grave concern to you and to all of us  Are you  at this point  able to assert with a one hundred percent level of confidence to this committee that every soldier being deployed to Iraq  as part of this escalation  will have all the necessary personal equipment       General Casey   Senator  that is my goal and I know that  s General Pete Schoomaker  s goal   And we work very hard to ensure that happens         Senator Clinton    Can you similarly ensure us that every soldier being deployed  as part of this escalation will receive all the necessary training for this dangerous assignment        General Casey   Again  that is the objective that both General Schoomaker and I have stated to our organizations         Senator Clinton   And finally will each and every soldier being deployed as part of this escalation have all the necessary force protection available to them to perform their mission        General Casey   And as I mention to you yesterday  I gave that guidance several weeks ago that would in fact be the case       Senator Clinton  Now  according to yesterday  s Business Week summary of a new Department of Defense Inspector General report  the Inspector General is concerned that the U S  military has failed to adequately equip soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan  especially for non traditional duties  such as training Iraqi security forces and handling detainees  The equipment shortages were attributed to basic management failures among military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan  U S  central command lacked policies for requesting and tracking equipment requirements for units to perform their duties   General  have you seen this Inspector General  s report        General Casey    I have not Senator         Senator Clinton  Mr  Chairman  I would like to ask that the committee request a copy of the Inspector General  s report that was referred to in the Business Week story and that it be made available to the committee as soon as possible       Chairman   It will be requested and will be shared with everybody       Senator Clinton   General  as Commander of U S  forces in Iraq  were you aware of the Inspector General  s investigation       General Casey    Now this is the SIGURr  s report       Senator Clinton Yes       General Casey  I am aware of a continuing Inspector General process going on   I wasn  t aware of this specific investigation  I know they  re out there all the time doing a range of investigations       Senator Clinton  Do you know if any member of your command cooperated with this particular report       General Casey   I don  t  but I assume they do because they routinely work with the Seger  s in doing their reports       Senator Clinton   Could you report back to the committee what you find about the level of cooperation with this report  please       General Casey    I will Senator       Senator Clinton  Thank you   Are you aware of the problems that are apparently cited in this report as set forth in press counts of it        General Casey    I  m not and I  m actually a little surprised  I think you said that was equipping of transition teams and I  ve spent a lot of personal time making sure that these teams have the best equipment because they operate relatively independently and we have gone to great lengths to make sure they have the equipment and I go up and talk to each group as they come through and I  ve not heard any mention of the transition teams being short changed on equipment       Chairman   Senator Clinton  if I could just interrupt   We did receive the IG report that you referred to  apparently last night and it is now in our files   Its classified secret  so when you read it  if there are parts of it you feel should be declassified we  ll make those requests  Sorry for the interruption         Senator Clinton  No  I would appreciate that Mr  Chairman because earlier this week I questioned Admiral Fallon about an article in the Washington Post titled    Equipment for Added Troops Is Lacking  New Iraq Forces Must Make Do  Officials Say     Mr  Chairman I  d like that article to become a part of the record of this hearing as well       Chairman   It will be part of the record       Senator Clinton  And after the hearing  the Chairman and ranking member sent a letter to Secretary Gates asking about the readiness of our troops  In that article were very specific and disturbing quotes from Lt  General Speakes and others about the lack of equipment  the lack of readiness  And among the concerns were the proper levels of armor for vehicles  preposition sets issued in Kuwait are the add on armor type and do not provide adequate protection  insufficient add on armor kits for logistic trucks and prime movers  insufficient and incomplete electronic counter measure devises designed to defeat IEDs  insufficient force protection materials for the outposts we are building in Bagdad and throughout Anbar province  insufficient training sets in vehicles at home station for units to train on and preparation for deployments  And I  m very concerned that we are pursuing a policy that  regardless of what one thinks about it or how one evaluates its chances for success  certainly raises the fears that so many of our young men and women are going to be put into very dangerous situations in neighborhoods in Bagdad  dependent upon their Iraqi counterparts who may or may not be reliable           And Mr  Chairman  I believe that because of these disturbing reports of equipment shortages  we should  as we begin to debate the Warner Levin proposal  include provisions that require that adequate equipment and training be mandated so that we do not send any young American into this dangerous mission without knowing that they are as well prepared  as ready and equipped as they deserve to be to try and fulfill this mission         General Casey   I don  t think anyone feels stronger about that then I do  Senator         Senator Clinton  Thank you General                   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq          ,0

286,   Obama  Webb Amendment Honors Troops    Sacrifice  Strengthens Military Readiness   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama  Webb Amendment Honors Troops    Sacrifice  Strengthens Military Readiness Wednesday  September 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  made the following statement on the floor of the Senate to urge his colleagues to support an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill to require minimum periods between deployment for members of the Armed Forces serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  The legislation is sponsored by Senator Jim Webb  D VA   Obama is a cosponsor  Below are Senator Obama   s remarks as prepared for delivery        Mr  President  I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator Webb to require minimum periods between deployments for members of our Armed Forces who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   This amendment protects our brave men and women in uniform and ensures that our Armed Forces retain their ability to meet any challenge around the world   I   m proud to be a cosponsor       I opposed the war in Iraq from the beginning and have called repeatedly for a responsible end to the foreign policy disaster that this Administration has created   Over 3 700 American servicemen and women have died in this war  and over 27 000 have been seriously wounded   Each month  this misguided war costs us a staggering  10 billion  and when all is said and done  it will have cost us  1 trillion        There are different views of the war in this chamber  but there is no disagreement about the tremendous sacrifice of the men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan   They have performed valiantly under exceedingly difficult circumstances   They have done everything that we have asked of them       But they have also been stretched to the limit   The truth is we are not keeping our sacred trust with our men and women in uniform     we are asking too much of them  and we are asking too much of their families   We owe it to our troops and their families to adopt a fair policy that ensures predictable rotations  adequate time to be with their families before redeployment  and adequate time for realistic training for the difficult assignments we are giving them        Our servicemen and women will always answer the call of duty  but the reality is that extended deployments and insufficient rest periods are taking their toll   The effects of this strain are clear   increasing attrition rates  falling retention rates among West Point graduates  increasing rates of PTSD  and unprecedented strain on military families      This amendment is a responsible way to keep our sacred trust while restoring our military to an appropriate state of readiness   It ensures that members of our Armed Forces who are deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan have at least the same amount of time at home before they are redeployed   It would also ensure that members of a reserve component  including the National Guard  cannot be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of their previous deployment         After four and a half years of fighting in Iraq and almost six years of fighting in Afghanistan  we owe it to our troops and their families to provide them with a more predictable schedule with sufficient time at home between deployments   As the Military Officers Association of America  which represents 368 000 members  has stated      If we are not better stewards of our troops and their families in the future than we have been in the recent past  MOAA believes strongly that we will be putting the all volunteer force at unacceptable risk          There are scores of anecdotes that bear out the strain on our families   One woman from Illinois recently wrote my office to tell me how her husband was facing his fourth deployment in four and a half years   She described how her husband had spent so much time in Iraq that  in her words      He feels like he is stationed in Iraq and only deploys home      That is not an acceptable way to treat our troops   That is not an acceptable way to treat their families        This amendment is not only important for military families  it   s also important for our national security        Our military simply cannot sustain its current deployments without crippling our ability to respond to contingencies around the world        This is all the more important since the Administration has squandered our resources on the war in Iraq and neglected to address other serious threats to our safety   According to a National Intelligence Estimate in July  al Qaeda has    protected or regenerated key elements of its Homeland attack capability     including a safe haven in Pakistan   s tribal areas  operational lieutenants  and its top leadership   Ensuring the readiness and capabilities of our troops will be crucial to confronting the threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and other parts of the world  and deterring other threats to America   s national security        Over the coming months  I will continue to push for a new course in Iraq that immediately begins a safe and orderly withdrawal of our combat troops  that changes

347,   Obama Call on Congress to Pass Locks and Dams Modernization Bill   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Call on Congress to Pass Locks and Dams Modernization Bill Tuesday  May  3  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  May 3  2005   OBAMA CALLS ON CONGRESS TO PASS LOCKS AND DAMS MODERNIZATION BILL   PEORIA   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today called on Congress to pass the Water Resources Development Act of 2005  WRDA   which would modernize Illinois  lock and dam system  The bill would authorize  1 8 billion for new locks and dams along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and  1 6 billion in federal funds for environmental ecosystem restoration projects along the same rivers   The new locks  one of which will be built right here in Peoria  will allow barges to pass through in minutes   said Obama   That means more crops going through faster  and more exports for farmers across Illinois who deserve to see their hard work pay off   It also means the creation of 6 000 new jobs over the next fifteen years  so we can put more people to work right here in Illinois  And to make sure we protect our environment  the funding for ecosystem restoration will keep the land around these mighty rivers clean and beautiful      The bill authorizes  1 8 billion for new 1 200 foot locks along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers  Five new locks would be built along the Mississippi River with two each in Adams and Calhoun County and one in Pike County  Two new locks would be constructed along the Illinois River in Peoria and Brown County  Obama noted that Illinois farmers export more than 50 percent of their corn and soybeans  most of which travel down the two rivers   Our nation s agriculture competitiveness depends on the strength of our transportation infrastructure   said Obama   Nations like Brazil know this  which is why they have invested heavily in transportation infrastructure for years to speed farm exports to key markets  When Illinois farmers target these same markets  it s clear that 1930s locks and dams cannot meet 21st century market demands   The bill also provides an unprecedented  1 6 billion in federal funds for environmental ecosystem restoration projects along the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers  and it would allow the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago to move forward on Thornton Reservoir construction  This construction would protect 556 000 people from potential flooding in 15 communities  prevent  31 million in flood damages each year  and reduce flood insurance premiums for local homeowners  Illinois  locks and dams were built many years ago to help barges travel the rivers  Barges enter the lock chambers where water levels are either raised or lowered depending on the direction the boat is traveling  The rivers  more modern locks are roughly the same length as today s barges  1 200 feet long   The barges take only minutes to pass through the lock system  Unfortunately  the older locks and dams are just half that length   For barges to travel through these sections of the rivers  crews must separate the barges into pieces  often taking two hours to complete  Obama also expressed his view that meaningful Corps reform is an important complement to the critical locks and dam and mitigation funding  and pledged to work with the chairman and other interested senators to seek consensus on Corps reform language that could be included in the bill before it leaves the Senate   I m proud to announce that we re one big step closer to building Illinois a lock and dam system for the 21st century   said Obama   Just the other week  the Environment and Public Works committee that I serve on passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2005  This bill  if passed by the rest of Congress  will provide  1 8 billion for new locks and dams along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers and  1 6 billion for environmental ecosystem restoration projects along the same rivers     The bill hasn t passed yet  but it s supposed to come up for a vote in the next few weeks  So if you believe  like I do  that we need this project to help families and farmers in Illinois  let Congress know so that we can finally get this done   Senator Obama is a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee                                        ,1

                     Urges Action to Ease Burden on States Providing Family Planning Coverage Through Medicaid

                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Congressional leaders to relieve administrative burdens on states trying to provide low income women with affordable family planning services by giving states the option to renew or expand those services under Medicaid without a cumbersome and unnecessary renewal process   In a letter to Senators Harry Reid and Max Baucus  Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative John Dingell  Senator Clinton called for the inclusion of the Medicaid State Family Planning Option  which passed the House as part of the Childrens Health and Medicare Protection Act  in any final legislation that addresses Medicare physician payments this year  Twenty five senators joined Senator Clinton in signing the letter    The federal government should make it easier for states such as New York to provide women with affordable family planning services  not harder  said Senator Clinton  Red tape should not hold back pragmatic efforts to help women and reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies    New York is one of twenty six states that have been granted waivers to expand Medicaids family planning coverage to low income women who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaids full insurance program   Unfortunately  the current waiver process is cumbersome and places excessive administrative burdens on the states  The Medicaid State Family Planning Option would make it easier for states to renew existing programs or expand access to family planning services in Medicaid through state plan amendment  without having to go through the difficult waiver renewal process  The plan would also improve access to preventive care and generate cost savings to the state and federal government  The Congressional Budget Office has determined that the Medicaid State Family Planning Option saves  400 million over ten years    In each of the last two Congresses  Senator Clinton has introduced the Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act  which provides the Medicaid State Family Planning Option  Senator Clinton has been a tireless champion of efforts to expand access to women s health care  ensure all women have access to contraception  and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies  As First Lady  she helped create the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy  which has helped reduce the teen birth rate by nearly a third since the early 1990s  She also worked to prevent restrictions on access to Title X family planning services from becoming law and helped lead the Clinton Administration s successful effort to increase Title X funding    The text of Senator Clintons letter follows       Dear Chairman Baucus  Majority Leader Reid  Speak Pelosi  and Chairman Dingell    As representatives of states with Medicaid family planning waivers  we are writing to urge you to include the Medicaid State Family Planning Option  passed as part of the Childrens Health and Medicare Protection Act  in any final legislation that addresses Medicare physician payments this year   The Medicaid Family Planning State Option would make it easier for states to renew existing programs or expand access to family planning services in Medicaid through state plan amendment  without having to go through the cumbersome and unnecessary waiver renewal process    Since the mid 1990s  26 states have been granted section 1115 waivers to expand Medicaids family planning coverage to low income women who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaids full insurance program   These demonstration projects have been unqualified successes   An evaluation commissioned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  found that these programs not only met more of the need for subsidized contraceptive care  and made that care more geographically available  but generated substantial cost savings   States as diverse as Alabama  Arkansas  California  Oregon and South Carolina have each been able to save the state and federal government more that  15 million in a single year by helping women avoid unintended pregnancies that would have resulted in Medicaid funded births      Unfortunately  the current waiver process has proven increasingly unworkable   Over the last decade  only seven of the 20 proposals for income based eligibility expansions approved by CMS have been approved within a year of when they were submitted by the state   Six applications took between one and two years for approval  and seven languished for two years or more before finally being approved   Particularly given the well established value of these demonstrations  the current approval and re approval required under federal law wastes critical staff resources  hamstrings states ability to meet changing needs  and limits our efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies and meet reproductive health needs in our states      In addition to relieving administrative burdens on our states and expanding access to important preventive health services  the Medicaid Family Planning State Option saves money   The Congressional Budget Office has determined that the Medicaid State Family Planning Option saves  400 million over ten years  savings that can be used to pay for other important health priorities      Giving states this option will improve access to preventive care  ease administrative burdens  and generate cost savings to the state and federal government   We urge you to relieve the administrative burden on our states by including the House provision giving states the option of expanding family planning services under Medicaid through state plan amendment in any final legislation that addresses Medicare physician payments this year    Sincerely         ,0

                  Washington  DC   Today  US Congressman Joseph Crowley  D Queens   the Bronx  and Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer sent a letter to President George W  Bush  urging him to support funding measures in the Homeland Security legislation that would provide adequate anti terror assistance for New York and other areas at greatest risk of attack   The letter  which 25 lawmakers cosigned  calls for the final version of the Senate Homeland Security omnibus to include a  risk based  funding formula that would allocate federal anti terror funds to regions based on assessed threat            Congressman Crowley said   The call to make sure that New York City receives enough resources to protect itself should not be a recurring theme   Congress needs to pass a homeland security bill that offers adequate assistance to New York  which remains terrorist target No  1   If responsibly allocated  these federal resources will help ensure New York s first responders get the sufficient training and equipment to save lives           Senator Clinton said   With our Homeland Security resources limited  we need to be smart about how we distribute funding to guard against terrorism   Sadly  all too often  funding decisions have been made based on politics in Washington instead of the reality in our cities and neighborhoods  I have long supported the 9 11 Commission s recommendation that  homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities             By establishing a risk based funding scheme for homeland security dollars  this bill fixes a glaring mistake in our national defense legislation   Schumer said   New York is the prime terrorist target  and we can not afford to leave it vulnerable to attack because faulty funding formulas send precious resources to low threat areas  I applaud the passage of this provision in the House and will fight to get it passed in the Senate           Last week  Rep  Crowley  and Sens  Clinton and Schumer met with New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and discussed the need for the New York to receive sufficient assistance to ensure that first responders receive the necessary resources to safeguard against another terrorist attack   Once it passes  the Senate Homeland Security bill will be reconciled with the House version  which was approved in January   The House version of the Homeland Security bill includes a funding formula that would disburse a greater percentage of homeland security funds according to risk            The text of the letter follows below       March 6  2007      The Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500      Dear President Bush       We are all in agreement that the most pressing issue facing our nation is the need to keep our homeland safe from terrorism   It was in a bipartisan way that we created the Department of Homeland Security and worked to develop unique programs to proactively keep our country safe and prepared   As both the House and Senate debate their respective 9 11 Commission bills  we respectfully urge you to weigh in and encourage the Senate to adopt several provisions contained in the House passed package  H R  1    In our estimation  H R  1 s funding formulas for the distribution of Homeland Security grants best represents the recommendations and intent of the 9 11 Commission          While we commend Senators Lieberman and Collins for their diligent work in drafting the  Senate bill  S  4    we believe the House passed version of this legislation  which makes our homeland security funding more  risk based   is far more representative of the needs of our country   especially those locations  facing the greatest risk  such as New York   Specifically  we are concerned about language in the Senate measure that provides state minimum funding levels that are far too high and ignore the more pressing needs of those states  cities  and localities at greatest threat of attack          We believe the House measure  which provides lower minimum thresholds for Federal Homeland Security grants than its Senate counterpart  ensures that all states will be able to fund their specific needs while still allocating a majority of our limited resources to those states and localities facing the greatest risk of an attack          As you know  H R  1 holds the distinction of being the first piece of legislation passed by the 110th Congress   Its prompt passage reflects the urgency the Congress and the American people have placed on enacting these important reforms   H R  1 s common sense approach to Homeland Security grant funding not only acknowledges the realities of dangers we face  it is in keeping with the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission   Therefore  we urge you to encourage both Democratic and Republican Senators to support H R  1 s funding formulas during consideration and debate of the Senate bill          We appreciate your leadership on this important issue and look forward to working with you as both chambers negotiate a conference report that meets the best interests of our nation s Homeland Security needs                                                                    Sincerely       Joseph Crowley

Under Review for Poor Performance  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   and Dick Durbin  D IL  today sent the following letter to Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt  calling on him to immediately release a list of 128 nursing homes that are being scrutinized for providing poor care   According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  identified these facilities because of their history of consistent violations of health and safety regulations  such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  serious neglect  and physical abuse   To date  the Department has identified only 54 of these facilities  refusing to disclose the names of the other 74 facilities  thereby potentially endangering the health and safety of thousands of our most vulnerable citizens   Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   Evan Bayh  D IN   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Ron Wyden  D OR  also signed the letter    In the letter  the nine senators also called on Leavitt to provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies as to whether they are permitted to release such information to the public   Last week  Obama sent a similar letter to Leavitt  vowing to pursue legislative action if this information is not released  Obama has not yet received a response to that letter  The text of the letter is below  Dear Secretary Leavitt  We are writing to express our serious objections to the withholding of critical information about nursing home conditions from America   s senior citizens  An estimated 1 5 million residents live in approximately 16 000 nursing homes in the United States   This year  federal  state  and local governments will spend  82 billion on nursing home care  of which  56 5 billion will come from the federal government through Medicare and Medicaid   All nursing homes that receive federal funding are subject to federal regulation and annual inspections   Under federal law  these inspections are a matter of public record and are made available to nursing home residents and their family members  and summaries of the inspection reports are posted on your department   s Nursing Home Compare website  www medicare gov NHCompare   These federal inspection and public disclosure requirements ensure that nursing home residents are receiving the high quality of care that they deserve   Given the importance of protecting one of our nation   s most vulnerable populations  we were disturbed to learn that your department is withholding information about some of the worst performing nursing homes in the country    According to press accounts  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  has compiled a list of 128    special focus facilities    that are among the worst performing nursing homes in the country   These facilities are ones that have consistently been cited for serious violations of health and safety regulations     violations such as improper medical care  preventable falls and accidents  pressure sores  serious neglect  and physical abuse   If these violations are not corrected  the facility could be subject to penalties and termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs    However  of the 128 worst performing facilities  only 54 of these nursing homes have been publicly identified   The remaining 74 facilities have not been disclosed to the public  even though this information would be invaluable not only to current residents of those facilities but also to potential residents and their family members   It is incomprehensible why the complete list of 128 facilities     which is determined on the basis of publicly available inspection reports     would not be made public  Although the names of the 128    special focus facilities    have not been made available to the public  press accounts suggest that the complete list has been provided to the American Health Care Association  the main lobbying organization for the nursing home industry   Providing information about poorly performing nursing homes to the lobbyists who represent those facilities  and not to the senior citizens who would most benefit from this information  is outrageous  There is also some uncertainty among state inspection agencies as to whether states have the right to release the names of the previously undisclosed    special focus facilities      Following recent press stories  the Iowa inspection agency released the names of the five Iowa facilities on the list  yet Texas officials have said they cannot release this information without permission from CMS    Accordingly  we call on you to immediately release the names of all 128    special focus facilities    or at the very least  provide clear guidance to state nursing home inspection agencies that they are permitted to release such information to the public   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  Tom Harkin  Edward Kennedy  Dick Durbin  Jeff Bingaman  Joseph Lieberman  Evan Bayh  Bernard Sanders  Ron Wyden                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions

193,   Obama Calls on Blackwater to Testify Before Senate   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Calls on Blackwater to Testify Before Senate Monday  October 15  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                 CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Calls on Prince to testify  Release details of Iraq contract  WASHINGTON  D C      Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  called on Chairman Joseph Lieberman and Ranking Member Susan Collins of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to ask Erik Prince  the head of Blackwater  to testify before the Committee and provide details of the company   s contract in Iraq  In February  Obama offered the Transparency and Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act  S  674   a comprehensive piece of legislation requiring more information and accountability on private security contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan  The Senate passed an Obama amendment in the Defense Department Authorization bill that will require federal departments to compile and report information to Congress on the role of contractors in Iraq  Obama has also introduced a separate bill  S  2147  to require private contractors to be held accountable under federal law    Below is a copy of the letter  October 15  2007  The Honorable Joseph I  Lieberman  Chairman   The Honorable Susan Collins  Ranking Member  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs   Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins   As you know  on September 16  2007  personnel from Blackwater USA  a private security contracting firm  killed as many as 17 Iraqi civilians in an incident in Baghdad   This incident  which has damaged the United States    reputation in the eyes of the Iraqi people  has highlighted the need for more oversight of our government   s use of contractors in Iraq   I am writing to request that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hold hearings on the proper role of private security contractors  as well as the September 16 incident  Earlier this month  Erik Prince  the head of Blackwater  testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform   At that hearing  Chairman Waxman decided not to ask Mr  Prince specific questions about the September 16 incident out of deference to a pending FBI investigation   However  in two interviews broadcast yesterday  Mr  Prince provided a detailed accounting of what he believes happened that day  asserting that Blackwater guards were fired upon  despite evidence to the contrary  On CNN   s    Late Edition     Mr  Prince suggested that Blackwater   s actions are dictated by the State Department        W e send professionals over there to do a job we do  dictated by the U S  government  by the State Department who hires us   We recruit  vet  equip  train and deploy them  and then we turn them over to the operational control to the U S  government         T hey dictate the missions  they dictate the vehicles  they provide the weapons  they tell us where to go and what to do     Mr  Prince also said that he welcomed greater scrutiny of Blackwater   s operations   On CBS       60 Minutes     Mr  Prince said      We absolutely want more oversight   We welcome the accountability   We want a good name for this industry      Given Mr  Prince   s willingness to submit to additional oversight  as well as the importance of these issues to our ongoing effort in Iraq  I request that you invite Mr  Prince to testify before our Committee  Although the House Oversight Committee shed some light on Blackwater   s practices and the State Department   s relationship with Blackwater  there are still many issues involving Blackwater that merit further oversight   These issues include   the lack of transparency associated with the hiring and conduct of private security contractors  the lack of accountability over their actions  the State Department   s role in covering up previous incidents in which Blackwater guards shot at Iraqi civilians  and the impact of the contractors    behavior on our efforts to win hearts and minds in Iraq and Afghanistan   All of these issues  I believe  merit further investigation by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee    In preparation for such a hearing  I believe it would be prudent to request a copy of the contract that Blackwater received from the State Department to conduct its mission   According to press accounts  that contract was awarded without competition from multiple bidders   Moreover  there remain questions about the rules of engagement under which Blackwater contractors operate in Iraq  including a belief that State Department contractors operate under rules of engagement that are more permissive than those under which Defense Department contractors operate  Given the military   s increased reliance on such private security contractors  greater oversight from our Committee would be both timely and important to ensuring that we understand not just what mistakes have been made  but how we can correct them in a way that protects our national interest   I thank you in advance for your consideration of my request       Sincerely     Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,1

                    Dredging Project is Critical to Ensuring Boater Safety and Protection of Town of Hempstead s Beaches

                    Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Peter King today called on Lt  General Robert L  Van Antwerp  Chief of Engineers of the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  USACE   to expedite the review of a proposal that would allow the USACE to accept funds from New York State which would allow the dredging of Jones Inlet to begin in the upcoming season  The lawmakers stated that while they are still committed to federal funding for this project  approval of this agreement would allow the dredging to be completed by the April 1  2008 deadline    By the Army Corps own standards this dredging project is long overdue  said Senator Clinton  There is a very real need to address the dangerous conditions created by the shoaling in Jones Inlet  and the agreement reached by the State of New York will provide the Army Corps with the funding needed to begin the dredging project on schedule  While I am still committed to federal funding for this project  I urge the Army Corps to review and approve the States agreement so that we can immediately address the Inlets safety risks and protect the Town of Hempsteads beaches as soon as possible     I am pleased that the Corps and the State are very close to an agreement  said Rep  King  but until the papers are signed  the project cannot begin  We have a very small window of time left if we are going to reach our April 1 deadline  and I urge them to resolve their differences quickly  Jones Inlet has become too dangerous to put this project off another year    While the FY 2008 Senate Energy and Water funding bill approved earlier this year by the Senate Appropriations committee allocates  3 million for the dredging of Jones Inlet  and the House has already approved  5 million for the project  New York State has also recognized the importance of this project and has appropriated  7 6 million in state funds so that dredging can begin this upcoming season  An agreement was reached that would permit the USACE to accept the State funds so that the project could begin next season and be completed by the April 1  2008 deadline  However  before the project can begin  the USACE must first review and approve the State funding agreement     Though the Army Corps recommends dredging Jones Inlet every four to five years  the last maintenance dredging of Jones Inlet was performed in 1995 and now  12 years later  the inlet has filled with sand  making both the channel perilously shallow and water conditions unpredictable for mariners  A primary concern is also for the safety of thousands of recreational boaters who are either forced to use other water channels or navigate outside Jones Inlets designated ones  since the water depth has shifted making the official lanes unsafe  The inlet also protects the Town of Hempsteads precious beaches by absorbing the brunt of storms  but has been unable to adequately do so with its diminished depth   This request marks the continuation of Senator Clinton and Representative Kings efforts to alleviate the dangerous conditions present at the Jones Inlet  In addition to their work to move forward with the dredging of the Inlet  earlier this year the lawmakers called on the USACE to work with the Coast Guard to monitor the Inlet so that the best and safest channel could be marked for boaters until the dredging could be performed    A copy of the Clinton King letter is below     October 10  2007   Lieutenant General Robert L  Van Antwerp  USA  Chief of Engineers  United States Army Corps of Engineers  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20310   Dear Lt  General Antwerp    We write in regards to Jones Inlet  a federal navigation channel in Nassau County   As you know  we have written in the past to the Army Corps of Engineers about the shoaling that has occurred in Jones Inlet and the dangerous conditions this presents to commercial and recreational boaters using the Inlet   Additionally  the beach at Point Lookout is in need of nourishment to protect the coast and surrounding homes and community from erosion and storm damage    The FY 2008 Senate Energy and Water funding bill approved earlier this year by the Senate Appropriations committee allocates  3 million for the dredging of Jones Inlet  and the House has already approved  5 million for the project   We remain committed to federal funding for this project in line with the historic precedence  and will continue to work for the FY08 bill to become law   New York State has also recognized the importance of this project and has appropriated  7 6 million in state funds so that dredging can begin this upcoming season   It is our understanding that an agreement has been reached permitting the Army Corps of Engineers to accept state funds to allow the project to occur this season  but that it presently awaits final approval by Army Corps headquarters      We write to respectfully urge you to expedite the review and approval of this agreement so that the dredging of Jones Inlet can be completed by the April 1  2008 deadline   This project is immensely important to the Point Lookout community and the boaters who travel the Inlet   Now that funding has been lined up  a prompt review is necessary to ensure that dredging of the Inlet can be completed this season   This will ensure the safety of this community in the upcoming storm and boating season    Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton     Peter King        ,0
1737,"JOINING FORCES TO STOP GLOBAL WARMING
  From a march on Montpelier to glaciers on Mount Rainier, from Norwich Green to the levees in New Orleans, Vermonters and people who care about our planet all across America are joining forces to stop global warming. The Vermont-based Step It Up 2007 coordinated events Saturday in all 50 states to call on Congress to cut carbon emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050.  
   ""The grass roots organizing effort that Step It Up is making in Vermont and all over this country, bringing thousands of people together to say that we've got to reverse global warming, we've got to support strong legislation in Washington, is exactly the right thing to do,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders. He is the chief author of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the only bill before the U.S. Senate that would reduce emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
   The only member of the Senate majority who serves on both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sanders introduced the global warming legislation with Senator Barbara Boxer, who chairs the environment panel. Senator Patrick Leahy is a cosponsor of the bill that former Vice President Al Gore called ""an excellent piece of legislation.""
   Said Sanders: ""If we can organize at the grass-roots level we can reverse global warming, we can protect our planet and, in the process, we can create millions of good-paying jobs as we move away from fossil fuels and move to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.""

1800,"SEN. SANDERS COMMENTS ON WAR IN IRAQ
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said today, on the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq, that the United States must bring its troops home as soon as possible. 
   ""More than five years ago, as a member of the House, I voted against giving President Bush the authority to go to war in Iraq. The president did not make the case for going to war then. He has not made the case for remaining in Iraq since then, and he has failed to provide a plan to end the war.
   ""Meanwhile, al Qaeda is stronger than at any time since September 11, and Osama bin Laden is still at large.
   ""The misguided war in Iraq already has lasted longer than it took the United States and our allies to defeat Hitler in World War II. We have lost almost 4,000 soldiers. Thousands more have been wounded. The war also is costing the United States $12 billion a month, and there are estimates that the ultimate cost of the war will be more than $1 trillion. This war is putting us deeper and deeper in debt as we rebuild Iraq while we ignore the urgent need to rebuild our aging infrastructure and other unmet needs here at home.
   ""Enough is enough. We must bring our troops home as soon as possible.""

1881,"TRAGEDY IN PAKISTAN
  Today, tragedy struck Pakistan and the world dealt with the shock of losing Benazir Bhutto. The former Pakistani prime minister, the first female leader of a Muslim nation, was assassinated. Reacting to this tragic news, Senator Sanders said, ""Despite the grave dangers she faced, Benazir Bhutto showed enormous courage by continuing to participate in Pakistan's democratic process. I am saddened and outraged by this cowardly assassination and I urge the Pakistani government to undertake a vigorous investigation to apprehend those responsible for this terrible deed. Pakistan, a nation armed with nuclear weapons, is now in the midst of dangerous political crisis. The United States must increase its diplomatic efforts in working with the democratic forces in Pakistan to promote stability, democracy and peace."" 
   Ms. Bhutto, 54, was first elected prime minister in 1988. Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was also a prime minister of Pakistan. She was murdered on Thursday at a political rally.

1932,"SEN. SANDERS MAKES CASE FOR EXPANDED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS
  U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told reporters here today he will champion expanding a network of Federally Qualified Health Centers that already play a critical role in providing cost-effective primary health care and dental services to more than 86,000 Vermonters. 
   Sanders called for a center in every Vermont county. He noted that there were only two centers in Vermont six years ago. Now there are seven. 
   ""The number of people now who are able to get high-quality health care has significantly expanded. We are making progress,"" Sanders said, ""but we all recognize that we have a long way to go to fulfill the goal of making sure that any person in Vermont, regardless of income, can walk into a community health center and get high-quality health care, dental care, mental health counseling and low-cost prescription drugs.""
   More than $5 million in federal funds support Vermont health centers this year. Sanders, a member of both the Senate budget and health committees, said he would seek a $798 million increase in next year's funding level for the nationwide program. That would bring the total amount authorized for next year to $2.9 billion. An increase of that magnitude would create or expand about 1,600 health centers and provide health care for some 8 million more Americans. The health centers now serve 16 million patients.
   Sanders also has called for doubling funding for the National Health Service Corps to $248 million. Through loan repayments and scholarships, that increase would support about 3,100 more primary care doctors and dentists to practice in underserved communities. The number of primary-care physicians and other health professionals trained in the United States is shrinking, according to a Government Accountability Office report. ""It is beyond comprehension that the richest nation in the history of the world is not able to graduate the kinds of health professionals we need,"" Sanders said.
   Sanders fielded questions from Vermont reporters after a meeting at his U.S. Senate office with representatives of health centers from throughout Vermont. 
   Currently, there are seven community health center organizations serving 10 Vermont counties. Sanders has been working with a community group in Addison County and with Springfield Hospital to add health centers in Addison, Windsor, and Windham counties. 
   The centers now care for one in eight Vermonters, including one in six uninsured patients, one in five Medicaid patients, and one in 10 of the privately insured patients in the state. The centers offer a sliding fee discount for uninsured patients, based on income and family size.

1784,"SEN. SANDERS: FARM WORKER EXPLOITATION MUST BE EXPOSED
  One day after a federal grand jury indicted six people for enslaving farm workers here, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said the Senate should hold a hearing on labor conditions at farms where ""people are being exploited ruthlessly.""
   Sanders held two days of meetings with the community-based Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which has struggled to improve working and living conditions for workers whose wages that have been stagnant for more that two decades. According to the 17-count indictment handed up Thursday, crew bosses allegedly beat workers, locked them in trucks and threatened physical harm if the workers left their jobs. 
   ""No worker in America should be treated the way tomato pickers in Florida are treated,"" Sanders said. A member of the Senate labor committee, Sanders said he had discussed a hearing into the farm workers plight with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the panel chairman. ""I have talked to Senator Kennedy and he is sympathetic to doing a hearing,"" Sanders said.
   Sanders also urged Miami-based Burger King to join other fast-food chains that have raised payments to pickers by a penny a pound. McDonald's Corp. and Yum Brands (the owner of Taco Bell) have worked with the coalition to significantly improve workers' wages. Sanders also asked the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange to withdraw a threat to slap a $100,000 fine on any grower that accepts the extra penny-per-pound from food chains. The letters from Sanders to Burger King CEO John W. Chidley and to Reggie Brown, executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange, also were signed by Chairman Kennedy, Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio).
   General working conditions on the Florida farms have changed little since 1960, when Edward R. Morrow exposed the horrendous treatment of farm laborers in the broadcast documentary Harvest of Shame. ""Tragically, almost 50 years later, not much has changed,"" Sanders said.
   ""In an era of globalization, the American people are becoming more and more concerned, not only about the quality of goods they consume, but about the conditions facing those who produce those goods. In my view, the American consumer does not want the tomatoes they eat to be picked by workers who are grossly mistreated and underpaid. This must not happen in the United States of America in 2008.""
   The Florida Tomato Growers Exchange executive has referred to the one-cent pay raise as ""pretty much near un-American,"" Sanders noted. ""Well, let me tell you what's un-American. Making workers pick nearly two and a half tons of tomatoes just so they can earn the minimum wage is un-American. Treating workers like slaves is un-American. Not providing decent housing for workers is un-American. Allowing workers to earn a decent living and treating workers with respect is not un-American. Indeed, it is what America is supposed to be about.""
   ""As poverty increases and the middle class shrinks, millions of American workers are being forced into a race to the bottom. They are working longer hours for lower wages while losing their health insurance, pensions and other benefits. We must address their plight not only from a moral perspective, but with the understanding that if we look the other way, and accept the terrible exploitation they are suffering, every American worker is in danger as that race to the bottom accelerates.
   ""I hope this issue can be voluntarily dealt with by the tomato growers, the companies that purchase the products and those who pick the tomatoes. If not, this is certainly an issue that Congress should address legislatively,"" Sanders said.

1798,"SEN. SANDERS WELCOMES GROWING SUPPORT FOR INITIATIVE ON GLOBAL WARMING
  Sen. Bernie Sanders today welcomed an urgent call by a group of major investors and corporations for the United States to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
   ""For years,"" Sanders said, ""the Bush administration turned a deaf ear as the scientific community warned us of the problem of global warming and its disastrous consequences. I hope the president will finally pay attention now the growing chorus of concern includes corporate America."" 
   The investors urging Congress to cut emissions by up to 90 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 include the California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, Merrill Lynch and The Capital Group, which manages $850 billion in mutual funds. President Bush has opposed mandatory greenhouse gas cuts and withdrew the United States from the 2001 Kyoto Protocol on global warming. 
   Sanders is chief sponsor of the bill that most closely tracks the level of greenhouse gas reductions the investors group is seeking. ""If we do not act boldly and aggressively our climate faces catastrophic changes. It's that simple,"" added Sanders, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
   Sanders and Senator Barbara Boxer, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, have proposed the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, which calls for an 80 percent reduction compared to 1990 emission levels by 2050. 
   ""By enacting these guidelines, we can usher in a new era of non-polluting, renewable energy sources,"" Sanders said. ""What makes our proposal even more exciting is its potential to reshape our economy and make the United States a leader in clean and efficient energy technologies creating millions of good paying jobs in the process."" 
   The Sanders-Boxer bill also calls on the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate regulations requiring corporate disclosures of climate change risks. The group of corporations and investors echoed that concern by suggesting in today's statement that the SEC clarify what companies should disclose to investors on climate change in their regular financial reporting.

1818,"VERMONT DELEGATION SENDS LETTER TO PRESIDENT BUSH
  Below is the text of the letter sent Friday to President Bush by the Vermont Congressional Delegation - Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Rep. Peter Welch - to request prompt declaration of an emergency in Vermont, to make the state and several communities eligible for federal disaster aid, in the wake of the recent series of severe summer storms:  
   July 20, 2007 
   The Honorable George W. Bush
  The President of the United States
  1600 Pennsylvania Ave., NW
  Washington, DC 20500 
   Dear Mr. President:
   We write to ask that you declare an emergency for the state of Vermont, which will make the state eligible for federal funds necessary to recover from a recent series of severe summer storms. Federal funding will allow the affected communities to rebuild the public infrastructure lost during the storms and assist residents and businesses piece their lives back together.
   Last week's severe thunder storms and rains dumped as much as 6 inches of rain in a short period of time, flooding streets, washing out roads and knocking down trees and limbs. In Barre, Vermont, a large section of the city's downtown was flooded with as much as 5 feet of water. Following the flooding, it was discovered that at least 1600 feet of the city's sewer line had been washed away.
   State emergency management officials have been touring the state during the past several days, and damage estimates already have reached $3 to $4 million. Many more villages and towns have yet to be assessed, and delaying the declaration could result in undue hardship for small communities already suffering from the disastrous storms. Towns in several counties were struck by the storms, including Washington County, Windsor County and Orange County. 
   It is one of the greatest responsibilities of the federal government to ensure that our state and local governments can clean up after a natural disaster. Please inform us if there is anything we can do to expedite the declaration process. 
   Sincerely, 
   PATRICK LEAHY
  United States Senator 
   BERNIE SANDERS 
  United States Senator 
   PETER WELCH

1976,"REAL STORIES FROM REAL AMERICANS ABOUT MIDDLE CLASS COLLAPSE
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) went to the Senate floor today to read from some of the hundreds of email messages he has received from people in Vermont and across America about their struggles coping with rising prices in a shrinking economy. 
   More than 500 emails were sent to Sanders in the week since he posted a video on his Senate Web page asking people for their personal accounts. 
   He called the outpouring ""powerful and overwhelming."" The messages, he added, had an ""articulateness that comes from telling the truth, from talking from their hearts.""

1961,"EVERY DAY SHOULD BE VETERANS DAY
  As Veterans Day approaches, Congress is considering legislation that would provide the greatest increase in funding for veterans programs since the Veterans Administration was created 77 years ago. ""Congress is finally making great strides in the effort to keep faith with our veterans,"" said Senator Bernie Sanders, a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. A bill before Congress this week represents the work of the nation's major veterans service organizations, which banded together to produce the Independent Budget for veterans programs. Their recommendations take into account many factors that affect veterans spending, including changes in the size and age of the veteran population, the rising cost of inflation and cost of living increases and trends in health care costs and delivery. Unfortunately, partisan wrangling and a veto threat from President Bush threaten to waylay the bill.

507,   Obama Calls for Investigation of Long Term Care   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls for Investigation of Long Term Care Thursday  March 29  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact  Ben LaBolt  Requests GAO investigation following reports of a high number of rejected claims WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Barack Obama today wrote a letter to the head of the Government Accountability Office calling for an investigation into long term care following a report in the New York Times of a high number of claims being denied  and practices that make it    difficult     if not impossible     for policyholders to get paid      A copy of the letter is below  The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548 Dear Mr  Walker  A March 26  2007  article in the New York Times investigated the practices of several long term care insurers and reported a number of troubling findings about practices that    make it difficult     if not impossible     for policyholders to get paid      According to the article  nearly 1 in every 4 long term care claims in California was denied in 2005  Nearly 9 million long term care policies had been sold as of 2002  the most recent year for which data were available  with about 80 percent purchased through the individual market and the remaining 20 percent purchased through the group market   These products provide elderly Americans with coverage for care in their homes  assisted living facilities  and nursing homes   This range of services is critical for the health and financial well being of seniors  70 percent of whom will require long term care at some point in their lives  Long term care is a problem of national significance   As the baby boomers age  policymakers are struggling to design a long term care system that meets the needs of Americans with disabilities   While progress has been made  the long term care system is heavily biased towards institutional care  and the quality of care is often poor   Moreover  nursing home and home care are very expensive  and Medicare coverage for both is limited   As a result  catastrophic out of pocket expenses for nursing home and home care by American   s older people are routine  forcing many to rely on Medicaid to finance the care they need  The federal government has taken steps to promote the use of long term care insurance   The Long Term Care Partnership Program  a public private partnership between states and private insurance companies  is one such example   The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program  sponsored by the Office of Personnel Management for federal employees  is a second example   In addition  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act has profoundly shaped the long term care market by establishing standards regarding the characteristics of policies whose premiums can count towards the tax deduction available for health care costs that exceed 7 5 percent of income  I have a number of serious concerns about the long term care insurance market and its ability to fulfill its promise to its policyholders   First  I am concerned about the possible arbitrary denial of insurance benefits to seniors at their time of need   Second  I am concerned that some insurers may be enticing individuals to buy policies by offering low premiums  and then sharply increasing premiums if lapse rates are not as high as assumed in the premium calculations   Third  a substantial percentage of policies do not offer inflation adjustments  resulting in a significant erosion of purchasing power in later years   Even worse  some companies offer    inflation coverage    which allows policyholders to purchase additional coverage at a later date  but at the price charged older purchasers   Premiums increase dramatically by age  and individuals who elect to buy coverage later may not realize that such coverage will be extremely expensive  which may be financially infeasible  Given the role of the federal government in long term care financing  I request that GAO investigate these allegations and the adequacy of state and federal regulation   Specifically  I request that GAO review the practices of these insurers in order to assess the following    Rate of denial of claims  and as feasible  the extent to which denials were justifiable  Types of policies purchased  including the percentage of policies that do adjust and do not adjust for inflation and those that allow for purchase of additional coverage at a later date   Estimated loss of purchasing power for those individuals that have policies without inflation adjustment provisions   Frequency and amount of premium increases in already purchased policies  average lapse rates of policyholders  and the correlation between premium increases and lapse rates    Extent to which long term care policies are marketed to individuals that would likely qualify for Medicaid or may not have substantial assets to protect  and   What  if any  additional federal regulation is needed  Thank you  Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator                                   ,1

                 Washington  DC   In light of recent media reports suggesting that a particular body armor system may offer better protection than the system currently being used by our servicemembers  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Jim Webb  D VA    both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee   today called on Comptroller General of the United States David M  Walker to initiate a Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation to reassess the body armor systems currently being issued by all the military services and the Special Operations Command for effectiveness and reliability against the threats facing U S  troops in combat           With United States troops risking their lives daily in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  we owe it to them to make sure they have the best equipment possible   Senator Clinton said            For several years  I have heard reports from active duty troops and military experts that Dragon Skin body armor is more effective than that currently being used   said Senator Webb    We owe it to those who are in harm s way to examine conclusively whether this is true           Recent media reports suggest that the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system may offer better protection than Interceptor Body Armor currently being used by our servicemembers   In light of these revelations   along with constituent concerns expressed to the Senators describing servicemembers and government personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan wearing alternative body armor systems because of concerns about inadequate body armor currently being issued to service members   the Senators requested that the scope of the GAO review include           1  A comparison and testing of the Interceptor Body Armor system with other commercially available products including the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system and the Special Operations Forces Equipment Advanced Requirements  SPEAR  to determine if troops are currently issued the best available body armor system          2  A determination of the necessary procurement steps required to obtain and field the best body armor systems for the armed forces          3  A review to confirm compliance and applicability of current body armor system policies and Safety of Use Messages for wear that apply to conventional forces and special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan            The full text of the Senators  letter to the Comptroller General follows          May 18  2007      The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C  20548      Dear Mr  Walker       We are writing to request that the Government Accountability Office conduct an investigation that would reassess body armor systems currently being issued by all the military services and the Special Operations Command for effectiveness and reliability against the threats facing our troops in combat          Recent media reports suggest that the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system may offer better protection than Interceptor Body Armor currently being used by our service members   Additionally  we have received constituent inquiries describing service members and government personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan wearing alternative body armor systems because of concerns about performance shortcomings with body armor procured by the Department of Defense           We owe it to our men and women in uniform serving in Iraq  Afghanistan  and other hazardous regions to provide them with the best possible body armor   Continuing allegations that superior body armor may be available but is not being acquired by the Department of Defense warrant an independent assessment            In light of these revelations and constituent concerns we request that the Government Accountability Office reassess the various body armor systems currently being employed by all branches of the armed forces and the Special Operations Command for effectiveness and reliability against the threats facing our troops in combat   The scope of this review should include   1  a comparison and testing of the Interceptor Body Armor system with other commercially available products including the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system and the Special Operations Forces Equipment Advanced Requirements  SPEAR  to determine if our troops are currently issued the best available body armor system   2  a determination of the necessary procurement steps required to obtain and field the best body armor systems for the armed forces  and  3  a review to confirm compliance and applicability of current body armor system policies and Safety of Use Messages for wear that apply to conventional forces and special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan            We look forward to your prompt response   Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton  James Webb    CC

                     Obama Introduces Comprehensive Bill to Strengthen Nation   s Middle Schools Friday  October 26  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  Obama   Chip Unruh  Reed   or Natalie Luna  Grijalva    WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today was joined by Senator Jack Reed  D RI  in introducing the Success in the Middle Act  which would authorize grants to states and school districts to improve low performing middle schools  help raise student achievement  and support our teachers   Representative Ra  l Grijalva  D AZ  has introduced a companion bill in the House   This bill would provide additional federal support to help students successfully complete the middle grades and turn under performing middle schools around     For far too long  our education system has overlooked our nation   s middle schools  and failed to provide them the resources they need for our kids to succeed     said Senator Obama      The middle school experience is vital to success in high school and college  and the lack of attention to middle school on a federal level is reflected in the rising high school dropout rate   Like cities across the country  Chicago has seen only 54  of students graduate from high school by the age of 19   We need to do more to invest in these schools  and this legislation will invest in a new generation of leaders by strengthening our middle schools  teachers  and students   If our country wants to remain competitive in math and science on a global level  we must break down any barriers that are preventing our kids from getting the world class education they deserve        Middle school is a critical time in a student   s educational and social development   It is important to reach at risk students early  before they experience a decline in grades and attendance   Research shows that sixth graders who do not attend school regularly or fail math and English are likely to drop out before graduating from high school     said Senator Reed  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee      This legislation will help reform our nation   s middle schools and provide increased support and training for middle school teachers   By targeting additional resources to these grades we will help our children reach their full potential and successfully transition to high school  college  and the workforce        I am very grateful to Senator Obama for initiating the Middle School Bill in the Senate   Middle Schools have long been a forgotten area in our school system     said Congressman Grijalva      This legislation will reverse this pattern and invest in the most crucial years of the education pipeline to ensure our students succeed     The middle school years are a time when academic achievement for U S  students falls dramatically  Minority and low income students are disproportionately affected by underinvestment in middle schools  International math and science comparisons indicate that students in the U S  do not start out behind students in other countries  but they do lag by the end of the middle grades   Many sixth grade students in urban  high poverty schools might attend school sporadically  might be suspended  or fail classes   Research shows that sixth graders with these indicators can account for 40 50  of eventual high school dropouts  and two thirds of the students who will be moved out of their homes and into the juvenile justice system   Since middle schools are more likely than elementary schools or high schools to be identified for improvement  we must identify and address these problems immediately    The Success in the Middle Act would authorize grants to states and school districts to improve low performing middle schools  States would use research findings and promising practices  and work with community partners  such as universities and non profits  to develop plans to improve middle school student achievement   Schools would use early identification data systems to focus on those students most at risk  and to determine how best to teach and support them  Funds would also be authorized to perform research on effective practices to support student learning  and on effective instruction for the middle grades   Specifically  this Act would  Authorize  1 billion a year to states to provide competitive grants to local school districts to improve low performing schools that contain middle grades  Using research findings and promising practices  states would develop detailed plans to improve middle school student achievement   Comprehensive centers  universities  and non profits  would provide technical assistance to the states in developing these plans   Develop and utilize early identification data systems to identify those students most at risk of subsequently dropping out  and to assist school districts in providing targeted interventions to help all middle grades students succeed  Invest in effective strategies at the state and district level such as providing professional development and coaching to school leaders  and developing and implementing comprehensive  school wide improvement efforts and implementing student supports  Authorize funds to generate and disseminate the results of research to identify and employ effective practices that support student learning and success at the middle level   This legislation is supported by the National Education Association  National Association of Secondary School Principals  National Middle School Association  Alliance for Excellent Education  ACT  College Board  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  International Reading Association  Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development  National Council of Teachers of English  National Forum to Accelerate Middle Grades Reform  and many others                                    ,1
1915,"SEN. SANDERS LEGISLATION TO HELP STUDENTS PURSUE DEGREES IN MATH, SCIENCE, ENGINEERING, MEDICINE, OTHER PROFESSIONS
  The Senate next week resumes debate on immigration reform legislation. Before Congress' Memorial Day recess, the Senate approved an amendment that would increase fees on employers who hire highly skilled temporary workers from other countries. The money would be used to finance scholarships for American citizens studying mathematics, engineering, health care and computer science. The vote, according to The New York Times, ""was a victory for Senator Bernard Sanders."" 
   This initiative will give American workers a brighter future, discourage companies from displacing Americans from good-paying jobs, and help middle-income families struggling to send their kids to college,"" Sanders said.
   Under his legislation, American Competitiveness Scholarships would be funded by raising to $5,000 the current $1,500 fee that companies are charged to bring high-skilled workers to the United States.
   The scholarships of up to $15,000 a year would go to students pursuing degrees in math, science, engineering, medicine, nursing and other professions. With the scholarships, he said, ""young Americans can get the education they need for these jobs.""
   The 59-to-35 vote was Sanders' first successful roll call vote on the Senate floor.
   Creating the scholarship fund with a surcharge on so-called H-1B visas, he said, ""says to those companies that want expanded access to foreign professionals that they have to give something back to our country."" He added, ""If companies can invest billions of dollars in China and India, it's about time that they invested in the future of the United States of America.""
   Over the last six years, Sanders noted, the median household income in the United States has declined by $1,273. Since President Bush was elected, 5.4 million Americans have slipped into poverty; 3 million more have lost their pensions; and nearly 7 million more have lost their health insurance. ""We can and must do better,"" Sanders said.

1749,"HEAD START PROGRAMS SERVING ABOUT 1,400 CHILDREN, THEIR FAMILIES IN VERMONT
  Head Start, the early childhood development program, has been a success story since it was created in 1965. It provides nutrition services and helps develop reading and math skills for children up to three years old. Legislation that would reauthorize Head Start for the first time in almost a decade is moving through Congress. Sen. Bernie Sanders is a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which has approved a bill that would authorize $7.3 billion for next year and more in the future. The amount would have been much less without prodding by Sanders in committee.  
   In Vermont, there are seven Head Start programs serving about 1,400 children and their families. More children are eligible. More children could be served with the adequate funding. ""We are working very hard to make sure Head Start is available all over this country and in Vermont for people who are eligible,"" Sanders said.

                   Click  here to read the full text of Senator Clinton s remarks    Click  here to watch video of Senator Clinton s remarks     Video courtesy of the American Constitution Society    Washington  DC    In a major policy address on the challenges of privacy in our increasingly data driven world  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for a comprehensive privacy agenda  a Privacy Bill of Rights that secures the interests of consumers  stronger  better enforced protection for medical privacy and a new national security consensus setting out clear rules to allow the government to use new intelligence techniques and make sure the public knows its rights and limits   Senator Clinton announced that she will introduce legislation to enact this Bill of Rights  the Privacy Rights and Oversight for Electronic and Commercial Transactions Act of 2006  the PROTECT Act              At all levels  the privacy protections for ordinary Americans are broken  inadequate and out of date   It  s time for a new comprehensive look at privacy   We need consumer protections that are up to date with the technological and national security needs of our time  for a world in which we can be confident that our security and our privacy are both protected     said Senator Clinton     We can protect our privacy in a more data driven and dangerous world   This issue is too important to be dealt with haphazardly or not at all   We need to stand by our cherished American ideals and think intelligently about how they apply in this new century          Privacy Bill of Rights      Senator Clinton underscored that we need a new set of consumer protections that boil down to three basic rights               People have the right to know  and to correct  information which is being kept about them             People have the right to know what is happening to their personal information when they are cooperating with a business and to make decisions about how it is used            And in a democracy  people have the right and the obligation to hold their government and the private sector to the highest standards of care with the information they gather          These rights should be basic to all of the consumer transactions we undertake and be part of a basic Privacy Bill of Rights that has to be adhered to by every commercial information gatherer or marketer       New Privacy Legislation to Ensure These Privacy Rights      Senator Clinton  s Privacy Bill of Rights will be encapsulated in the PROTECT Act  the Privacy Rights and Oversight for Electronic and Commercial Transactions Act of 2006   The PROTECT Act will provide consumers with clear privacy rules  clear protections for their most private information  the right to sue when those rules have been violated  the right to protect their phone records  the right to freeze their credit when their identity has been stolen  the right to know what businesses are doing with their credit and credit reports  and the right to expect the government to use the best privacy practices itself with their personal information   Major provisions will include       Right to Clear Protections of Consumers   Most Private Information   Senator Clinton  s bill ensures that for the most deeply personal information about how we spend money on a daily basis  consumer information will be shared only when consumers   opt in             Right to Sue and Seek Damages   Currently  there is no set definition of what privacy violations cost the individual and little incentive for banks and other businesses in many instances to protect personal consumer data with the highest level of security   As a result  it is very hard for consumers to seek redress through the courts   Senator Clinton  s bill will create a tiered system of damages  exempting the smallest businesses with set minimums of  1000 for breaches and  5000 for actual misuse of information       Right to Protect Phone Records   Right now  it  s too easy to purchase  post or trade cell phone numbers and records   Buying and selling that kind of information is a gross invasion of privacy but it is not clear that it is a crime   This will only get more challenging as more consumers move to phone service based on broadband Internet technology for which no regulations currently exist   Senator Clinton  s legislation will work to get ahead of the curve of technology  making sure that consumers   private cell phone numbers and call records remain private       Right to Freeze Personal Credit   Right now  consumers that are victimized can place a credit   alert     but they cannot freeze their credit   Senator Clinton  s bill would allow consumers concerned their information has been compromised to contact credit agencies and say    no access and no new credit          Right to Know   Senator Clinton believes that the right to know is a critical consumer protection   Her bill would ensure that consumers have the               Right to Know When Identity Theft Happens   Senator Clinton  s bill will require that consumers are notified immediately if their credit or identity is compromised   Notification is currently required in some states but not all   As a result  many identity theft victims are unaware even years later that their information has been put at risk                 Right to Know When Your Data Leaves the United States   Some firms are sending data abroad for processing  away from the protections of U S  law   Senator Clinton would ensure that consumers will be notified when their personal data is sent abroad and have the right to   opt out                Right to Know Your Credit Report   Consumers should have credit information provided to them once each year without paying a fee or jumping through hoops   Senator Clinton  s bill would make this a standard practice       Right to High Standards from Government   The PROTECT Act would create a high level privacy czar in the Office of Management and Budget   This Chief Policy Officer for our government would have oversight into the workings of every government department and the power to make sure the law is being followed and best practices are being implemented          Right to Medical Privacy   Consumers have a right to expect that privacy protections will be enforced   As technology expands and medical information is more widely available  we need to make sure medical privacy protections keep up by ensuring one set of high standards for everyone who deals with healthcare information and making sure that these standards are upheld   We also need to put real teeth in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  by making sure companies comply with the law and that those who violate it are held

                   CARE  Act would ensure women are   offered necessary medical care and treatment

                 Washington  DC    U S  Senators Jon S  Corzine  NJ   Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Olympia Snowe  ME  today introduced legislation to ensure that survivors of rape have access to and information about emergency contraception  The Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act  or CARE Act  would also make certain that women receive the necessary medical care to prevent sexually transmitted diseases        Last year  the U S  Department of Justice released its first medical guidelines for the treatment of rape victims  but absent from the 141 page protocol were references to emergency contraception as a potential option for sexual assault victims  In contrast  protocols for sexual assault victims developed by public health employees at the Centers for Disease Control included access to emergency contraception         In another example of how the Bush Administration is playing politics with women s health  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has refused to make a decision on whether the  morning after  pill  also known as Plan B  should be available over the counter  Today s press conference on emergency contraception follows a confirmation vote in a Senate Committee on Lester M  Crawford  President Bush s nominee to head the FDA  Frustrated by the FDA s refusal to make a yes or no decision about the over counter availability of Plan B  Senators Clinton and Patty Murray  D WA  have indicated that they plan to put a hold on Dr  Crawford s confirmation vote on the Senate floor          Ideology should never stand between a patient and appropriate medical care  We need to make sure that hospitals present to the survivors of sexual assault every treatment option   said Senator Corzine   It is simply unacceptable that a rape victim s care depends on which hospital she is taken  This legislation will help sexual assault survivors across the country receive the medical care they need and deserve          With an estimated 300 000 women the victims of sexual assault each year  we must do everything in our power to ensure that they have every health care option at their disposal  Every survivor deserves the appropriate treatment to ensure that they are not faced with the injustice of insufficient care  With this legislation  we have put the lives and safety of victims first   said Snowe          Rape survivors have already suffered immeasurably and the last thing they should worry about is the quality of medical care they will receive  Each victim deserves the very best treatment and complete access to all the necessary resources and support services   Senator Clinton said   This legislation will remove road blocks and provide real options for rape victims  Emergency contraception is a valuable tool that can prevent unintended pregnancy         U S  Representatives Steve Rothman  D NJ  and Rob Simmons  R CT   who also spoke at the press conference  have introduced a companion version of the bill in the House of Representatives         Also speaking at the conference was Karen D  Carroll  a registered nurse from Westchester County  New York  Ms  Carroll  a licensed nurse for 27 years  has spoken before dozens of health and law enforcement officials about sexual assault  and is currently responsible for coordinating the recruitment and training for a program that provides forensic examinations 24 hours per day  7 days a week to patients in need  She is also a survivor of marital rape        Every two minutes a woman is sexually assaulted in the U S  and an estimated 25 000 victims become pregnant as a result  By providing access to emergency contraception  88 to 95 percent of those unintended pregnancies could be prevented if emergency contraception is administered within the first 24 to 72 hours        Emergency contraception works by inhibiting ovulation or fertilization  or by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg before a pregnancy can occur  It cannot terminate an established pregnancy  nor will it affect the developing pre embryo or embryo        In addition to providing emergency contraception  the bill ensures that patients can receive post exposure treatment for sexually transmitted diseases  Some diseases  including HIV and hepatitis B  cannot be reliably cured if treatment is deferred  yet can be prevented if post exposure drugs or vaccines are administered soon after the assault         In the Senate  the CARE Act now heads to the Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions             ,0

       Legislation Introduced to Ban Lead in Toys for Young Children Wednesday  October  3  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Karen Lightfoot  Waxman   Sharon Jenkins  Toure Muhammad  Rush   Rebecca Gale  Carney   Rick Jauert  Ellison   or Amy Brundage  Obama  WASHINGTON  D C      Citing recent recalls and the longtime failure of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to protect children from hazardous levels of lead in consumer products  Rep  Henry A  Waxman  together with Reps  Bobby L  Rush  Christopher P  Carney  and Keith Ellison  today introduced the Lead Free Toys Act to ban lead from toys  toy jewelry  and other products used by children under age six   Sen  Barack Obama introduced the companion bill in the Senate today      Lead in children   s products is dangerous and unnecessary     said Rep  Henry A  Waxman  Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee      For nearly three years I have called for strong action to get the lead out of these products   I hope now the time has arrived   This is the kind of simple  commonsense action that the Consumer Product Safety Commission should have taken years ago           The provisions called for in this bill are long overdue given more than 30 years of documented evidence of the damage that can be done to children  especially those in low income communities  from exposure to this neuro toxin     said Rep  Bobby Rush  Chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce  Trade  and Consumer Protection of the Committee on Energy and Commerce      Following recent hearings on this issue in our subcommittee  I believe that a full ban on lead in children   s toys and jewelry is the only way to prevent this poison from harming children and families         As a father of five  I am concerned about our children   s safety  Children   s toys on U S  store shelves should not contain unknown hazards that can cause such potentially devastating harm     said Rep  Christopher P  Carney      This legislation is a good first step to keeping hazardous substances out of our children   s toys   I look forward to working with Congressman Waxman to ensure the safety of toys across the nation   As the holidays approach  this legislation is even more urgent        I am honored to stand with Congressman Waxman in introducing this important legislation to ban lead in children   s toy products     said Rep  Keith Ellison      This is personal for me   Last year  one of my constituents  a four year old toddler named Jarnell Brown died because he swallowed a charm on a bracelet that contained dangerous amounts of lead   Were this legislation the law of the land  perhaps Jarnell would be celebrating a fifth birthday this year   This bill  when enacted  will prevent future tragedies for Jarnell Brown  his parents and countless other American families        Lead contaminated toys have endangered the lives of millions of our country   s children     said Sen  Obama      The health of our children is a top priority  and we must take every step required to protect them from these dangerous products   The extraordinary scale of this challenge demands meaningful and innovative solutions to prevent lead contaminated toys from harming our children   This legislation will help restore the confidence of the American people that the products they are using are thoroughly inspected and safe  and I thank Chairman Waxman for his leadership on this issue       High doses of lead can cause seizures and even death  while low doses can cause impaired learning and behavioral problems   Recent recalls of popular children   s toys have brought attention to the problem of lead in such products  but this issue is not new   In late 2004  nearly 150 million pieces of toy jewelry were recalled for toxic levels of lead   In 2005 and 2006 millions more pieces of tainted jewelry were recalled  and in March 2006  a young child died after ingesting a Reebok charm that contained over 99  lead  In January 2005  citing the initial wave of toy jewelry recalls  Rep  Waxman called on the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  to take decisive action to protect children   When CPSC refused to set a strong  enforceable standard  Reps  Waxman  Rush  and others introduced the Lead Free Toys Act  a bill directing CPSC to ban anything above trace levels of lead in children   s products   Now  over two years later  new recalls have exposed the presence of lead in many more children   s products  and CPSC still has failed to address this hazard   Today   s legislation imposes a statutory limit on lead in children   s products  rather than directing CPSC to impose such a ban  Under the bill as reintroduced  any product marketed for use by children under age six or whose substantial use by children under age six is foreseeable may contain no more than the following levels of lead  600 parts per million  ppm   effective within 30 days of enactment 250 ppm  effective one year after enactment 100 ppm  effective two years after enactment This step wise approach will impose immediate changes to protect children while giving manufacturers additional time to develop controls to ensure that all children   s products are free of lead  The text of the bill is available online at www oversight house gov                                    ,1

1530,April 19  2007 Clinton Presses Bush Pentagon on Contracting Abuses in Iraq

                   Pentagon Officials Admit They Have No Idea when Accountability Measures will be in Place       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  at today s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  pressed Bush Pentagon officials on the Administration s lax and inadequate oversight of contractors in Iraq  which has cost taxpayers billions in over payments  fraud and waste   Senator Clinton cited specific examples of contractors openly defying Pentagon attempts to control costs and limit spending but failing to be held accountable   Senator Clinton also questioned Army officials about their efforts to develop monitoring of contractors and when monitoring would be in place   none were able to reply            Following her questioning  Senator Clinton emphasized that  we just cannot let this go on  It s not fair to the people in the field  it s not fair to the people in the Defense Department  who are frankly outmanned    Senator Clinton emphasized that currently  the contractors have so much more capacity to be able to manipulate the system  and the end loser is the soldier in the field and frankly all the rest of us           The following is a transcript of Senator Clinton s questioning at today s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing          Senator Clinton   It is especially important to get to the bottom of the questions that we are asking today   And Mr  Chairman  I would respectfully request that you perhaps consider either charging one of our existing subcommittees or creating a special subcommittee to delve more deeply into the issues that are being raised here   The seriousness of these allegations and frankly the waste and fraud that is so evident from so much of the what we ve heard merits that  but in addition we ve to got to figure out what we re going to do going forward   We cannot afford to continue this            Over the last four years  we have paid KBR  20 billion to provide logistic support in Iraq   I thought when we enter into a contract we were in charge of telling the contractor what to do  but some of the reports that we have seen on this committee make it sound as though the contractor s in charge of telling the United States military  the United States government what to do           Here are a few excerpts from some of the DoD documents from July 2005                 There were concerns as to  the contractors  reluctance to down size the labor force after the transfer or support missions to the sustainment contractor                  Also  July 2005   The use of self directed work added additional cost to the task order with no visible benefit to the government                 March 2006   There was no effort to coordinate with the contracting officer to de scope changes based on the reduction requirements and to establish a new definite price                 April 2006   Command personnel advised us that the contractor wouldn t move idle personnel or equipment assigned from one task order to another task order to accomplish needed work   When we brought this situation to the attention of top contractor operational personnel  they informed us this was a company policy            Secretary Bolton  why is the contractor permitted to be reluctant to down size the labor force   Why are they adding self directed work to the contract   Why aren t they coordinating with government officials in order to reduce requirements and costs   And how can they have a company policy that requires the United States tax payer to pay for idle workers   Who s in charge of this contract  DoD or the contractor       Secretary Claude M  Bolton  Jr   Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition  Logistics and Technology   Well  I would hope that the DoD is  Senator Clinton   In response to allegations such as those  what we ve done is put together several panels run by the government  run by the Army   One is to look at requirements   These are requirements that come on a regular basis from the commanders to make sure that the commander is getting what he or she really wants   Sometimes those requirements are inflated   We also have a group whose job it is  once we have those requirements  to actually figure out how much it s going to cost and then negotiate that with the contractor who s already put in a bid   And many times those bids are a lot larger and higher than we d like them to be  so we put people in place to correct some of the things that you ve just mentioned   Are we there yet   Are we perfect yet   No   I ll take your allegations and anybody else s that I get from the auditors here  which we ve done over the years and we will correct those   I think we re getting better  but we are not there yet       Senator Clinton   Well  of course one of the problems has been the extraordinary increase in the outsourcing of government functions to private contractors   I think the latest figures I saw is that we now have three times more private contract employees then we do military and civilian employees   There is no evidence that these contract employees perform better than government employees or that they do it more cost effectively   And there has been no database or system of accountability to keep track of all of these contractors   Now in October 2005  DoD issued DoD instruction 302 42  which included the requirement that DoD develop or designate a joint database to maintain by name accountability of contractors deploying with the force and a summary of the services or capabilities they provide   GAO report 0714 entitled   Military Operations High Level DoD Action Needed to Address Longstanding Problems with Management and Oversight of Contractors Supporting Deployed Forces   provides great detail on these DoD instructions and the importance of having full accountability   May I ask  just starting with Secretary Bolton for a yes or no answer  if any of you have reviewed the GAO report 0714  Secretary Bolton       Secretary Bolton   Only at the summary level       Senator Clinton   Next please       William H  Reed  Director  Defense Contract Audit Agency  DCAA   No       Senator Clinton  Next       Keith D  Ernst  Acting Director  Defense Contract Management Agency   Yes Ma am       Patrick Fitzgerald  Auditor General of the U S  Army  Yes Senator        Major General Jerome Johnson  Commanding General  U S  Army Sustainment Command  Yes Senator       Senator Clinton   Okay  And the GAO report concluded that the Army was still in the process of implementing the database and that is uncertain when the process will be completed   So  this has been going on for now  two and a half years   I guess a little less than that   And we still don t have it   Does anyone know when the process will be completed   Can any witness answer that   Does anyone know when our deployed senior leaders and commanders will have a grasp of the accountability problem with all these contractors           I ll let the record show that to both questions  all the witnesses shook their heads  no          Chairman Levin   The record will indicate that  unless the witnesses indicate right now otherwise       Secretary Bolton   Only to talk about the database   We do have a SPOT report that we provide to commanders   That s still in the emergency database  That does account for the contractors   The problem that the commander has is more than just the people that I have on contract   Since that commander is responsible for the entire battle space  it s not only my contractors  it s the contractors from the coalition forces  it s the contractor from private companies  but he also has to be concerned   The database that you referenced earlier  is still maturing  that s at the DoD level  we re part of that   I cannot answer your question in terms of when it will be complete and how we ll keep it updated       Senator Clinton   Secretary Bolton  which Army staff agency is responsible for the implementation of this database       Secretary Bolton   That will fall under me   If we re talking about contracting and contractors  once I have that  I ll issue a policy on that       Senator Clinton   Well  there was a disagreement reported in the GAO report as to whether this falls under logistics or personnel   Has that disagreement been resolved       Secretary Bolton   I don t know if it s been resolved yet or not   General Johnson       General Johnson   No  it has not been resolved   I m a bit reluctant in answering this because I don t know the current status   I m in the field now versus the building   There was a system and a team established as we moved into the war fight   We called it Triple C  which is Contract Control Cell   It was established by the Army material command  operated under my command  to make an effort to contract to account for contractors on the battle field   Frankly  it was bigger than us   That s when we got the help of DoD  the logistics management readiness crew  and they came up with a SPOT report   We have taken that to the field commanders   They have looked at it  In many cases it does not provide some of data points that they want so that they can manage these contractors and it s going to require some  inaudible  procedures as Mr  Bolton has outlined  that we currently just don t have   We have  so in some cases  we have some accountability   We don t have what we need           LOGCAP s a bit different   We probably have pretty close to  I d be  in the 90 percent range confident that I know how many LOGCAP contractors I have on the battle field and where   But  when we open up the scope to all the contractors on the battle field  we have contractors who perform what we call field service representatives  who follow particular systems that are in the field that require contractor repair and we have numerous other contractors  supporting contractors   So  that s kind of the complexity of the problem   Doesn t answer and doesn t give an excuse for not having the capability  We re working very hard at it  but we re just not there yet       Secretary Bolton   Senator Clinton  if I could just add  on the note that I was handed  on the SPOT that stands for Synchronized Pre deployment Operational Tracker   That s the tracking of the contractors   That is in the office of Secretary of Defense Business Transformation office and it s still under development         Senator Clinton   Well Mr  Chairman  I think that the issues that this hearing has raised are such serious ones   This whole question about contracting out services where the chain of command either doesn t exist or it s essentially outsourced as well to the contractor  or whether it s certainly confused  and where people cannot be held accountable  The failure to have adequate databases  and that s on top of the testimony from our colleague Senator Dorgan  about just outright fraud and abuse and just heartbreaking waste in the system   So  I think that this certainly is an issue that demands our attention and perhaps an effort to try to sort out all of these various problems of accountability   Trying to get a better handle on what should or shouldn t be outsourced and I hope that this committee can take lead on trying to establish a strong foundation similar to what our colleague Senator McCaskill referred to with the groundbreaking work of then Senator Truman  because we just cannot let this go on  It s not fair to the people in the field  it s not fair to the people in the Defense Department  who are frankly outmanned  They have inadequate databases  It s like sending them into a battle with a pop gun against heavy artillery because the contractors have so much more capacity to be able to manipulate the system  and the end loser is the soldier in the field and frankly all the rest of us               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq          ,0
1305,March 16  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Vote to Increase the Federal Debt Limit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement on the Senate vote to raise the federal debt limit   Republicans voted overwhelmingly for the amendment  approved 52 to 48          Today  s vote to increase the federal debt limit to nearly  9 trillion represents a profound failure of this Administration  s and Republican Congress   policies   It is not only a failure of fiscal discipline   It is a failure of foresight  vision and above all a failure of leadership        Instead of building upon the progress made in the 90  s  when tough decisions were made on both the spending and revenue side which resulted in budget surpluses  job creation and unprecedented economic growth  the Republicans instead chose a path that moved our nation towards the four largest budget deficits ever and the highest level of indebtedness of any nation in the history of the world          Instead of making investments in the American people through education  job training and health care and creating a foundation for new economic opportunities and a stronger America in the future  we have increasingly ceded our fiscal sovereignty to foreign nations like China  Japan  and the OPEC consortium who now finance about 45 percent or  2 2 trillion of our nation  s publicly held debt          Instead of offering budget plans that were balanced and didn  t place further burdens on the middle class  the neediest in our society and future generations  we were given reckless tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy   These shortsighted policies have since exploded the debt to the point where today  the fourth largest expenditure for this federal government is simply interest on the national debt to the tune of  247 billion per year         Regrettably  this Administration and the Republican leadership were unable or unwilling to accept the basic logic and simple math which clearly demonstrated that their policies were unsustainable   This failure has forced this chamber to confront the bleak reality of the fiscal landscape that their policies have wrought  the fourth increase in the debt limit in five years totaling over  3 trillion   Indeed  since this President has taken office  the national debt has increased 53 percent   Foreign held debt has increased 120 percent   And the President  s own budget acknowledges that in five short years  his policies will have resulted in a national debt of nearly  12 trillion  roughly the size of our entire economy today          Clearly  today should be a wake up call for all Americans concerned about the future of our children and the economic security of our nation   The current leadership has steered us away from the path of responsibility  shared sacrifice  and prudent  judicious policy making to the reckless course of crushing debt  deficit financed tax cuts and increasing the burden on the middle class   Raising this debt limit while embracing policies that further exacerbate the deficit is in essence a   children  s tax   a burden borne not by this Administration or this Congress  but by our sons  our daughters and our grandchildren    It is for these reasons that I oppose this increase in the debt limit             ,0

1258,December 16  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks  this body came together    Republicans and Democrats alike    around the shared goal of  preventing a similar tragedy from ever occurring again on our soil   Towards this end  Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act  legislation that expanded many of our laws  providing our government and law enforcement with the tools needed to ably combat these threats   We understood then  as we do now  that these tools are important in our fight against terrorism   And because there is no greater responsibility that we bear as members of this body than ensuring the safety of our citizens  I voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 and supported its reauthorization when the Senate considered its bill earlier this year       But even in the immediate aftermath of the September 11th tragedy  Congress recognized that in its haste to give law enforcement these expanded powers  there was a risk that this new authority was coming at the expense of constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties   And so in the wisdom of both Republican and Democratic legislators  several provisions of the Patriot Act included four year sunsets  allowing Congress the opportunity to revisit whether the Patriot Act strikes the proper balance between securing our safety and ensuring our freedom        I have very serious concerns that the current Patriot Act Reauthorization conference report  which was negotiated largely without the input of Democrats  does not do enough to strike this proper balance   I believe that we can be both safe and free   The conference report falls well short of achieving that goal   I am hopeful that bipartisan negotiations can result in a compromise bill like the one agreed to in the Senate in July  a bill which did a far better job of protecting our civil liberties        The current conference report fails in many respects         Section 215 of the Patriot Act gives law enforcement in domestic intelligence investigations nearly limitless power to obtain all types of personal records  including business  library  and medical records   Under current law  the government merely needs to demonstrate that the records it seeks are   sought for    a terrorism investigation   Upon such a showing  a secret court is required to issue the order   This is an extremely lenient standard  one that for the first time gives the government almost unchecked access to the sensitive personal information of innocent Americans    To compound matters  the third parties    business  libraries  hospitals  and the like    who are recipients of these orders are subject to an automatic gag order   They cannot tell anyone that they have been asked for these records  including the person whose documents the government is seeking       Given its broad scope  this provision has tremendous potential for abuse   Innocent Americans should not be subjected to these possible intrusions when adequate safeguards can be written into the law  ones that would not sacrifice the utility of these orders as a law enforcement tool   Americans should not have to hope that the government will demonstrate self restraint in its exercise of this power  nor should they fear that their personal records will be part of a government fishing expedition         The Senate bill  which I supported  not only required the government to meet a higher standard before issuing these orders  it also gave recipients of a FISA order an explicit and meaningful right to challenge these orders and their accompanying gag orders in court   The conference report sadly retains a variation of the current law  s exceptionally lenient standard of review  a standard that effectively turns the courts into little more than a rubber stamp   Further  the conference report does not give the recipient of a FISA order any express right at all to seek meaningful judicial review of its gag order   Quite simply  the conference report places inadequate checks on these orders         Another failure of the conference report was exposed in an article appearing in the Sunday  November 6  2005 edition of The Washington Post  which brought to light a very troubling practice by the FBI that underscores the importance of adopting proper safeguards       National Security Letters  NSLs  are administrative subpoenas that allow the FBI to obtain sensitive information about ordinary Americans in national security cases   NSLs are issued by FBI agents without the authorization or approval of a judge  grand jury or prosecutor   While the FBI has long employed NSLs  the Patriot Act greatly expanded their scope  significantly lowering the standard for their issuance   The result has been  according to The Washington Post  a   hundredfold increase    in their use  with the FBI annually issuing thousands of NSLs demanding private information about ordinary Americans not necessarily suspected of any crime   These records include financial  library  credit card  telephone  internet service provider  and email records as well as customer transaction information   These NSLs are governed by strict gag orders that prevent companies from telling their customers that their records were given to the FBI       As this description suggests  NSLs are very similar to Section 215 FISA orders  but with one very critical difference    NSLs do not require the government to get any court approval whatsoever   While NSLs can be an important tool in our fight against terrorism  their unfettered and unchecked use makes them susceptible to abuse that infringes upon the privacy of innocent people   The Senate version of the Patriot Act Reauthorization bill created important checks on the power to issue and enforce NSLs    protections absent from the conference report    without hindering the effectiveness of this law enforcement tool         Other sections of the conference report give rise to additional concerns   The conference report would give law enforcement the free wheeling power to impose roving   John Doe    wiretaps without the safeguards needed to protect innocent Americans from unnecessary surveillance  casting aside important checks on this power that were included in the Senate bill   The report would also give the FBI the right to enter and search a home or business without providing notice to the owner of the residence of business for a month or longer after the search   And the conference report contains a provision that seriously curtails the habeas corpus rights of prisoners to challenge their convictions in court   This provision was in neither the House nor Senate bills  and there has been practically no debate on the merits of this change       Apart from the serious civil liberties concerns  perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the conference report is its failure to incorporate a threat and risk based formula for the allocation of critical homeland security funds to our local communities  states  and first responders   This deficiency was emphasized just last week by the former 9 11 Commission  who issued a blistering indictment of our Homeland Security failures       As I said earlier  I have long maintained that protecting the security of our citizens and our Homeland is the most important responsibility I bear as a U S  Senator   To that end  I believe that to truly make America safe  we need to carefully allocate our Homeland Security resources   We need to make sure that the money gets to where it is needed  that our American cities and states living under the greatest threat receive the funding they need to protect themselves   Unfortunately  up until now  a substantial portion of our Homeland Security money has been allocated according to congressionally mandated formulas that bear little relation to need and risk        Our resources should be dedicated to addressing our most glaring weaknesses   During their negotiations  I encouraged my House and Senate colleagues considering the Patriot Act reauthorization bill to account for this reality in our Homeland Security funding   I have maintained    as the former 9 11 Commission reiterated in its report last week    that lawmakers should cease playing politics with the allocation of our limited resources by promoting distribution formulas that ignore risk and threat    The Commission  s report card was a condemnation of this Administration and the Congress  both of whom have demonstrated far too little urgency in enacting the reforms needed to properly secure our Homeland and fight the War on Terror         The former 9 11 Commission sent a clear  discernable message to the entire nation last week    reform is needed at all levels of government   The failure to incorporate in the Patriot Act conference report a much needed threat based formula for the allocation of Homeland Security funds is a major shortcoming and needs to be corrected       As I noted at the outset  apart from these concerns  the Patriot Act contains provisions that provide law enforcement with important tools in the War on Terror   Because we cannot afford to be without these tools  I am supporting bipartisan legislation that will extend the sunsetting provisions of the Patriot Act by three months   Just because we are coming up against the end of the year does not mean we should have to compromise the rights of law abiding Americans   This extension will preserve the current state of the law on a temporary basis  giving those working on the bill the opportunity to craft a compromise that both safeguards our liberty and gives our law enforcement the capabilities they need to effectively combat and investigate terrorist threats   I am also hopeful that during this three month extension  those working on the reauthorization bill will heed the call of the former 9 11 Commission and include provisions that mandate the distribution of Homeland Security funds on the basis of threat and risk        While we all recognize the importance of equipping our law enforcement with the tools they need to effectively combat terrorism  we also must ensure that those tools are administered in a manner that does not unnecessarily restrict the freedom and liberty that are the hallmark of American life   Like all Americans  I am troubled by recent reports that the President signed an order in 2002 that authorized the National Security Agency to conduct domestic spying on U S  citizens and foreign nationals in the United States  despite legal prohibitions against such activity   Likewise  I am disturbed by recent reports that the Department of Defense is maintaining a database in order to monitor the activity of peaceful anti war groups   The balance between the urgent goal of combating terrorism and the safeguarding of our most fundamental constitutional freedoms is not always an easy one to draw   However  they are not incompatible and unbridled and unchecked executive power is not the answer       I believe the conference report falls short of this goal  and I am hopeful that with more time  those negotiating these provisions will find the proper balance          ,0

                     Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  16 5 million in the FY06 Defense Department Appropriations bill for projects to benefit the Capital Region   The House has approved the bill   The Senate is expected to work on the Defense Appropriations bill this week   If the bill is passed  it will be sent to the President for his signature        Projects to be funded under the bill include  3 million for the Arsenal Support Program Initiative at Watervliet Aresenal   2 million for the Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS Raven  by Benet Labs   1 million for the Joint Manufacturing Technology Center at Benet Labs   2 million for the Smart Machine Platform Initiative by Benet Labs and Techsolve   2 million for Plug Power  s Fuel Cell Development for Continuous Operation of Government project   3 5 million for High Temperature Superconductor  HTS  Generators for Navy All Electric Ships by Superpower   1 8 million for the Functionally Reactive Surfaces Technology Program at Starfire  and  1 2 million for SUNY Albany Center of Excellence for Nanotechnology Secure Advanced Fabrication Facility for Electronics  SAFFE   National Secure Foundry  Initiative       This is great news for the Capitol Region   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Capitol Region and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Capitol Region defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge           The Capital Region has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support            3 million in federal funds is slated for Arsenal Support Program Initiative ASPI programs at Watervliet Arsenal   The purpose of the ASPI is to help maintain the viability of Army manufacturing arsenals and the unique capabilities of these arsenals in supporting the national security interests of the United States  ASPI funds are used by the arsenal to market its unused space   and its potential   to private contractors  The Watervliet Arsenal has used this funding in the past to make significant improvements to the buildings and roads at the site   This has been key to attracting at least fourteen new companies and dozens of new jobs to the site         2 million in federal funds will go to Benet Labs for the ATLAS Raven project  This system supports the goal of developing an ultra lightweight combat vehicle that will significantly enhance the ability of all services to rapidly deploy to trouble spots worldwide  The ATLAS system will provide the enabling technologies for unprecedented reductions  50   in the weight of large caliber high muzzle energy cannons  These weight reductions in the gun system will in turn bring the vehicle weight well under the 14 ton limit required for air transportability  Benet Labs is located within the Watervliet Arsenal        In addition   1 million in federal funds will go to Benet Laboratories   The funding will be dedicated specifically for accelerating the development and implementation of advanced materials  technologies  and designs for Department of Defense  DoD  legacy and emerging weapon systems   The Joint Manufacturing Technology Center  JMTC  fulfills a critical national demand for an interdisciplinary approach to unite academic research and industrial know how to solve complex problems in advanced materials development and manufacturing technology        Also   2 million in federal funds will go to Benet Weapons Lab and Tech Solve Smart Machine Platform Initiative   For the Army  the DoD and the US industrial sector  it is critical that components can be fabricated domestically both for development and production needs in a timely and affordable manner   Though capable of operating more quickly and more precisely than that of earlier generations  the productivity of today  s machine tools is still bound by the same inability to extend beyond basic execution of instructions   The next generation of machinery must not only execute instructions  they must also possess complex internal sensing and control systems to create instructions and integrate them  in real time  into manufacturing processes   The Smart Machine Platform Initiative is designed to develop these systems and TechSolve  s Ohio Team partnering with Benet Weapons Lab will work to this end           2 million in federal funds will go to Plug Power to support efforts to develop fuel cells for Continuity of Government  DOD is required to have an effective Defense Continuity Program  DCP  to ensure mission critical functions continue despite any potential enemy threats or attacks  Continuous run  distributed power in disperse locations  is a significant component of any DCP  This program will develop and optimize fuel cell systems for these DCP applications  and begin demonstration and evaluation in distributed sites  culminating in an extensive report evaluating fuel cell ability to meet Defense Continuity requirements  Such a demonstration will help to illustrate the vital role that fuel cells can play in providing distributed power generation and reliable back up power in the event of terrorist attacks  natural disasters  or grid failure  Plug Power is a founding member of New Energy New York    3 5 million in federal funds will go to Superpower for the HTS Generators for Navy All Electric Ships  The Navy has made a decision to implement electric drive on its next class of surface combat ships  and to examine the use of all electric power systems in other ships and submarines  The all electronic design will enable electric warships to quickly divert a ship s propulsion power for use by state of the art electrical weapons and advanced long range sensors  Second generation high temperature super conducting wire has the potential to revolutionize this and a variety of other military applications where high power density  as well as reduced size and weight  at reasonable cost is absolutely essential  Although dramatically smaller and lighter than conventional generators  HTS generators can produce an equivalent amount of electrical power  The reduced size of HTS generators is of particular relevance to the All Electric ship because it allows increased flexibility in ship architecture  enhanced power density  and transient response  improving overall ship performance and survivability  Superpower is a founding member of New Energy New York    1 8 in federal funds will go to Starfire Systems  Inc   Functionally Reactive Surfaces Technology Program   The 2006 program will demonstrate a textile patch hybrid circuit that will support the integration and control of diverse technologies such as temperature sensors  chemical sensors  active features for physical comfort and a textile based rechargeable battery  all integrated into a fire protective textile garment for both soldiers and domestic first responders  The patch and the associated array of fabric sensors are required to field an intelligent uniform that will monitor both the health of the soldier and the threats in the environment  Chemical  Biological  Nuclear  etc     The limiting factors that prevent this capability today are the lack of miniaturized wearable electronic components  actuators  sensors  communication  and microcontrollers  which are also prime objectives of the Future Force Warrior  FFW  vision  The individual sensor  integral power  and active fabric technologies all need to be integrated  monitored wirelessly  and be intelligently controlled by an electronic circuit using minimal power   The goal of this project is to demonstrate an ultra microminiaturized hybrid circuit and packaging technology that will enable this integration and combination of multiple sensors and control logic into a robust silicon carbide board based package the size of a postage stamp            1 2 million in federal funds will go to SUNY Albany Center of Excellence for Nanotechnology Secure Advanced Fabrication Facility for

1310,March 16  2007 Senators Clinton  Collins  and Representatives Engel  Fossella Announce Reintroduction of Legislation to Help Fight Growing Rates of Diabetes Striking Pregnant Women Across Nation                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Susan M  Collins  R ME  along with Representatives Eliot Engel  D NY  and Vito Fossella  R NY  announced today that they have reintroduced companion legislation in both chambers of Congress to combat growing rates of diabetes striking pregnant women across the nation   The Gestational Diabetes  GEDI  Act is aimed at lowering the incidence of gestational diabetes  which puts women at increased risk for complications during childbirth and puts their children at increased risk for developing debilitating Type 2 diabetes as adolescents or adults             Gestational diabetes affects women and children across New York State   In New York City alone  the disorder has risen by a staggering 50 percent in the last decade   This should be a call to action   The tragic fact is that gestational diabetes is preventable  but too many women unknowingly put themselves and their children at risk   We need to raise awareness of this condition and do everything we can to turn these alarming statistics around   said Senator Clinton            Our legislation will help to stem the growing epidemic of gestational diabetes in our country  which puts the health of both mother and child at risk   said Senator Collins    The evidence is clear that there is a direct link between gestational diabetes and Type 2 diabetes   The GEDI Act will help to identify new treatments and interventions that will reduce the incidence of the disorder and the subsequent risk of mother and child developing Type 2 diabetes in the future            The growing problem of Gestational diabetes in pregnant women is a public health crisis we must act on today   In New York City  gestational diabetes has risen by nearly 50 percent in about 10 years  an astounding statistic  Gestational diabetes has long lasting effects not just for mothers but for their children  putting them at higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes   Our legislation will significantly expand on research efforts at the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  and National Institutes of Health  NIH  so that we may better understand gestational diabetes  Further  our bill will provide grants to states to employ innovative  community based prevention and treatment strategies to control this serious disease   said Congressman Engel            This legislation will bring much needed attention to a disease that is affecting increasing numbers of American women each year   It is essential that we foster new and unique approaches to educate about gestational diabetes and to develop more effective means of intervention to reduce the risk for women and children   We need to take action to curb the rates of gestational diabetes  as well as the overall incidence of diabetes in this country  I believe an expansion in resources and improved data collection provided for in this bill is an important step   said Congressman Fossella           Gestational diabetes is a disorder that affects between four to eight percent of pregnant women in the United States and the numbers are growing   More women than ever are entering pregnancy overweight  which can trigger gestational diabetes and threaten the health of both the mother and child   Genetics  ethnicity  and maternal age are other risk factors for the disease            New therapies and interventions to detect  treat  and slow the incidence of this disorder need to be identified   The GEDI Act will support increased understanding of the factors that contribute to this condition and help mothers who develop gestational diabetes reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes   The GEDI Act will create a Research Advisory Committee headed by the CDC to monitor gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy to develop methods to prevent onset of Type 2 diabetes   Also  the Act will allocate funding through demonstration grants for projects to assist health care providers and communities in finding ways to reach out to women so they better understand how their health during pregnancy will impact their own as well as their child s health   The bill will also expand on current research by the NIH and the CDC to help lower the incidences of gestational diabetes            The GEDI Act is supported by the following organizations  American Diabetes Association  National Research Center for Women   Families  Society for Women s Health Research  International Community Health Services  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  American Association of Diabetes Educators  American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy  National Association of Chronic Disease Directors  Association of Women s Health  Obstetric  and Neonatal Nurses Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations          The GEDI Act was first introduced in the 109th Congress by Senators Clinton and Collins  The companion bill in the House of Representatives was also introduced during the 109th Congress by Representatives Engel and Fossella          ,0

The omnibus bill  which includes 11 appropriations bills  will now go before the House for final passage before being sent to the President for signature     These projects are crucial to fueling economic growth across Central New York and for giving local residents top notch services in education  law enforcement and health care  said Senator Schumer  By investing in these vital projects  we ensure that Central New York continues to lure new businesses and tourists to the region  while ensuring families have the first class services they need    The funds included in this bill are a wise investment in Central New York  and will touch the lives of many New Yorkers  These projects will help to improve our schools  hospitals  and communities  and will strengthen New Yorks economy and infrastructure  said Senator Clinton  I am especially pleased that funding for interoperable communications in Onondaga County was included in this bill  It will be used for critical upgrades that are essential for the safety and effectiveness of Central New York law enforcement and first responders  I also welcome support for the Auburn Regional Bioenergy Enterprise  which will further cement Central New Yorks reputation as a center for alternative energy  and funding for the Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome  which is vitally important to our national security    Onondaga County will use the federal funds to improve the Interoperable Communications System for first responders in Syracuse and the surrounding areas  Funds will be used to replace incompatible 800MHz radio equipment to the proposed City County UHF Trunked Land Mobile Radio Interoperable Communication System  Infrastructure equipment currently used to support two way radio communications will not be consistent with equipment planned for the new first responder system that supports operations in the City of Syracuse and County of Onondaga  Onondaga County is in the process of building and planning to implement a trunked radio UHF Land Mobile Radio System  This system when implemented will embrace all first responders in the City of Syracuse and County of Onondaga  This project will consolidate all

204,   Obama Introduces Bill to Limit Use of Mercury   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Introduces Bill to Limit Use of Mercury Wednesday  July 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt Recent report shows dangerously high mercury pollution continues to be produced  WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today reintroduced the Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act  which prohibits the use of mercury in chlorine or caustic soda manufacturing by the year 2012   This legislation was prompted by an in depth report published by the Chicago Tribune that highlighted the extent of mercury contamination in the fish eaten by Americans   Much of the mercury emitted into the environment today is a result of chlorine and caustic soda production   Oceana  an environmental group  today released a report highlighting that several chlorine production plants continue to threaten public health through their mercury production       The level of mercury in the fish we eat continues to remain high  posing a particularly acute health threat to pregnant women and children     said Senator Obama      We know that mercury can cause serious developmental problems in children and problems affecting vision  motor skills  blood pressure  and fertility in adults   This bill will phase out the use of mercury in U S  plants that manufacture chlorine and caustic soda   Cost effective technology is available today to transition these plants to safer production processes  keeping all of us and our environment safer and healthier      Sampling conducted by the Chicago Tribune in late 2005 showed surprisingly high levels of mercury concentrations in freshwater and saltwater fish purchased by Chicago area consumers  fish like tuna  swordfish  orange roughy  and walleye  The Tribune also reported on how existing programs at the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have failed to adequately test and evaluate mercury levels in fish   As many as 630 000 children born annually in the U S  are at risk of neurological afflictions related to the consumption of mercury   And almost 10 percent of women in the U S  of childbearing age have mercury in their blood at a level that could put a baby at risk   The chlor alkali industry is one of the principal sources of the mercury production   Chlor alkali facilities manufacture chlorine gas and caustic soda  important chemicals that serve as the building blocks of many of the products and plastics essential to modern everyday life  For more than 100 years  mercury has been a key component in the chlorine process   Since 1974  however  about 115 plants worldwide have converted to better technologies such as membrane and diaphragm cells   Today in the United States  more than 90 percent of the chlor alkali industry has switched from using mercury to using these alternative catalysts   Moreover  of the 8 plants in the U S  that still use mercury  3 are in the process of stopping   The remaining 5  however  have made no such commitment   It is also worth noting that in 2005 alone  the 5 uncommitted mercury using plants reported that they released more than 4 400 pounds of mercury into the air  on average four times the average mercury releases of a standard coal fired power plant   The Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act  or M5 Act  prohibits using mercury cells in the chlorine or caustic soda manufacturing process by the year 2012  The M5 Act also puts procedures in place by mid year 2008 to track and report mercury input and output in the chlor alkali industry  The evidence suggests that between 2000 and 2004  the industry could not account for more than 130 tons of mercury  The EPA calls this    an enigma     The M5 Act addresses this enigma by tightening up mercury tracking requirements   This bill also provides for the transfer and storage of mercury from closed or closing facilities   And it directs the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Register to conduct a health assessment at those facilities that still use mercury after 2008   Obama originally introduced this legislation during the 109th Congress  along with the Mercury Market Minimization Act   In November 2006  Senator Obama called upon the Department of Energy to stop its proposed sale of large quantities of mercury  The Department subsequently announced it would not sell its stockpiles                                   ,1

682,   Obama  Harkin Introduce Low Carbon Fuel Standard that Would Reduce Emissions  Dependence on Foreign Oil   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Harkin Introduce Low Carbon Fuel Standard that Would Reduce Emissions  Dependence on Foreign Oil Monday  May  7  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Obama  or Kate Cyrul  Harkin    Legislation would expand the renewable fuels market to reduce carbon emissions WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation establishing a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard that would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions in the short and long term   The bill requires a reduction of about 180 million metric tons in emissions in 2020     the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road   The Obama Harkin fuel standard embraces the growth of the renewable fuels market  including corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  and biodiesel as a key component of fighting climate change  while incentivizing lower carbon emissions in their production         Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles is one of the most aggressive and immediate steps we can take to fight climate change     said Senator Obama      Expanding the renewable fuels market in the United States will reduce our dependence on foreign oil  revitalize our agricultural sector  and provide a sustainable means to combat global warming   A homegrown solution to the international climate crisis lies in America   s fields and farms             It   s time to act on climate change     said Senator Harkin  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee      We   ve got to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions  and emissions from our vehicles need to be a part of that   This bill sets a standard that establishes a steady downward trend for life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of our transportation fuels   Because biofuels generally have lower life cycle greenhouse gas emissions  this bill also promotes rural economic development and national energy security         The U S  relies on imports for 60  of the petroleum it consumes  and the oil used in the U S  transportation sector accounts for one third of our nation   s emissions of greenhouse gases   Senators Obama and Harkin have introduced a bill establishing a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard  NLCFS  that will reduce both our dependence on foreign oil and our greenhouse gas emissions   The National Low Carbon Fuel Standard Act of 2007 will   Provide near term demand certainty to renewable fuel producers  The Renewable Fuel Standard in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 will be expanded in the near term to require 15 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012  Expand the market for low carbon fuels over the long term  The NLCFS requires fuel refiners that produce petroleum based fuels to reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the transportation fuels sold in the U S  by 5 percent in 2015 and 10 percent in 2020   Because most biofuels have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline  the NLCFS will greatly expand the market for renewable fuels such as corn based ethanol  cellulosic ethanol  and biodiesel while incentivizing lower carbon emissions in their production  By one estimate  the NLCFS will create a market for over 40 billion gallons of biofuels by 2020  Drive the production of ultra low carbon fuels   The bill requires fuel refiners to use minimum amounts of fuels with 50 and 75 percent lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline  This requirement signals to investors that there will be a market for advanced fuels  but still allows significant leeway for fuel refiners to choose the optimal mix of fuels to meet their overall greenhouse gas emissions targets  Utilize a credit trading mechanism  Fuel refiners can trade allowances or bank them against future carbon reduction requirements   Ensure an environmentally sustainable biofuels expansion  The bill ensures that the expansion of biofuels production does not impact national wildlife refuges  national parks  national forests  old growth forests  or national grasslands  The bill calls for an assessment of the impacts of the expansion  including a comparison to the business as usual scenario of continued reliance on petroleum based transportation fuels  and the development of standards by 2012 to protect air  land  and water quality  Achieve a major reduction in greenhouse gas emissions  According to one estimate  the NLCFS would reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by about 180 million metric tons in 2020   This is the equivalent of taking over 30 million cars off the road in 2020   If enacted in conjunction with a bill  S  768  proposed by Senator Obama to raise fuel efficiency standards  the NLCFS would reduce emissions by about 530 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2020  the equivalent of taking over 50 million cars off the road  Achieve a major reduction in oil imports  By making greater use of home grown  renewable fuels  the NLCFS could reduce the annual consumption of gasoline derived from foreign oil imports by about 30 billion gallons in 2020                                    ,1

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer today announced they have introduced legislation to launch a Hudson Fulton Champlain Commemoration Commission to promote national observance of the historic voyages of Henry Hudson  Samuel de Champlain  and Robert Fulton  The Hudson Fulton Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission Act of 2007 is similar to bills that were offered in two previous Congresses  The U S  House version of the bill was introduced by Representatives Maurice Hinchey  D NY  and John M  McHugh  R NY  in mid March  Every member of the New York delegation is a cosponsor of the legislation introduced in the House           The Hudson Fulton Champlain Commemoration Commission represents a unique opportunity to celebrate New York and America s glorious past but it is also an opportunity to bring visitors to New York as they learn about our history and our heritage   Senator Clinton said   The Commemoration Commission will facilitate Hudson Fulton Champlain related activities throughout New York and the United States  With a focus on heritage tourism and appropriate economic development  the Commission aims to provide a first class visitor experience as well as a lasting legacy and long term public benefit to the communities involved            The Hudson Fulton Champlain Commemoration Commission will honor three unique men  explorers  inventors  and dreamers all  who are an integral part of New York s rich history   said Schumer    The natural beauty of Lake Champlain and the Hudson River is enhanced by the varied and vital events that make up the region s history   This commission will not only give New Yorkers a chance to celebrate our state s impressive heritage  but it will attract many tourists from all over the country  creating a huge economic boost for the region            This legislation will help pay tribute to three men who impacted the history of our state  our country and the world  while also helping to spur economic development through various commemorative events and activities that will attract tourists to the area   Hinchey said   New York has a very rich history that deserves to be properly acknowledged   By introducing this bill  we are recognizing our state s great historical past  while also helping our state s future by creating opportunities for revenue from tourists and local visitors who participate in commemoration activities   I look forward to working with Senator Clinton  Congressman McHugh  and our other colleagues to finally get this bill passed            New York has a long and storied history and heritage  much of which stems from the explorations of these three great men   Congressman McHugh said   Lake Champlain and the Hudson River have played significant roles in the economic growth of area communities and our state as a whole  Not only will these Commissions help bring well deserved recognition to these rich legacies  but also a better understanding and appreciation of our American heritage   This bipartisan legislation is a worthy endeavor and I look forward to working with my New York colleagues to pass this bill            The legislation is intended to assist efforts to celebrate the upcoming 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson s first exploratory sail up what is now called the Hudson River in 1609  the 400th anniversary of Samuel de Champlain s first exploration in 1609 of what is now called Lake Champlain  as well as the 200th anniversary of Robert Fulton s Hudson River voyage in 1807 in which he introduced steam navigation on a commercial basis          In 2002  New York State enacted legislation creating a state commemoration commission  The federal Hudson Fulton Champlain 400th Commemoration Commission will be established to coordinate educational  cultural and historical projects while cooperating with and assisting the programs and activities conceived by New York and Vermont  The Commission will also be responsible for facilitating nationwide and international celebration efforts  It is also hoped that the Commission will support and facilitate marketing efforts for a commemorative coin  commemorative stamp and other related activities          The first European exploration of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain  and the introduction of steam navigation to maritime commerce are celebrated both in the United States and abroad  In 1909  Americans celebrated the 300th anniversaries of these events with maritime celebrations and art exhibitions  The Dutch built the first replica of Hudson s ship  the Half Moon  and sent it up the Hudson River for the observance  Congress recognized the 350th anniversary by establishing a similar commission to coordinate federal participation in the 1959 celebrations          ,0

1889,"IMMIGRATION BILL DEFEATED
  The Senate rejected an immigration reform package that Sen. Bernie Sanders opposed because it would have driven down wages and benefits for U.S. workers by letting employers recruit lower-paid foreign guest workers.  
   ""At a time when the middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing and millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages it makes no sense to me to have an immigration bill which, over a period of years, would bring millions of 'guest workers' into this country who are prepared to work for lower wages than American workers. We need to increase wages in this country, not lower them,"" Sanders said after senators voted 53-to-46 to set aside the legislation.

948,September 12  2007 Senator Clinton Joins Bipartisan Coalition of Senators to Call on President Bush to Release Additional Funds from LIHEAP Contingency Fund                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Clinton Urges Action to Assist Low Income Households Before Funds Expire

                      Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that she has joined a bipartisan coalition of Senators in calling on President Bush to make available the remaining  151 5 million in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund for low income households   In a letter to the president sent yesterday  the bipartisan group urged him to render assistance to households that are facing hardship due to increasing energy costs  and to release these funds before  131 million expires on September 30    No American should have to choose between paying for food or prescriptions and paying their energy bills but with energy prices increasing  that is exactly the kind of false and dangerous choice that many people are facing  said Senator Clinton   LIHEAP can help families who face this unthinkable situation  and the time to act is now   Low income households disproportionately endure the burden of rising energy costs  and the president must act to release the  131 million that could ease that burden before it expires at the end of this month  I urge the president to release all remaining LIHEAP contingency funds so that we can help those who are in need    A National Energy Directors Association  NEADA  survey this year found that millions of American households experience difficulty paying arrearages from last winters heating bills  coping with shutoff of service  and meeting rising air conditioning costs   LIHEAP offers federal funds to these households  which may face rate increases of up to 50 percent this year   Of the  151 5 million that remains in the LIHEAP contingency fund   131 million is scheduled to expire September 30     A copy of the letter sent to President Bush follows    The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    The  50 million released last week from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund is a good first step to address hotter than normal conditions experienced in several parts of the country this summer   However  a significant need still exists across the nation for additional home energy assistance to help families and seniors meet rising arrears and shut off notices   We strongly urge you to immediately release the remaining  151 5 million in the LIHEAP contingency fund and provide funding to all states to address this emergency   If the Administration fails to release the remaining funding   131 million of that balance will expire on September 30      Earlier this summer the National Energy Directors Association  NEADA  conducted a national survey of utility arrearages and shutoffs   The survey found that millions of low income households this year are facing a severe hardship paying arrearages from last winters heating bills  coping with impending and actual shutoff of service  and meeting rising air conditioning costs   The survey estimated that at least 1 2 million households have been disconnected from electric and natural gas service during the three month period following the end of state shutoff moratoriums   This was a conservative estimate as the level of shutoffs was likely to go higher as utilities completed credit and collection procedures   The statute specifically defines a significant increase in home energy disconnections as an emergency and reason for the release of funds    According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   U S  residential electricity prices are expected to increase at a rate of 3 percent this year   States undergoing market restructuring continue to experience more rapid price increases as rate caps expire and higher fuel costs are passed through to consumers   In some instances  customers may see rate increases of up to 50 percent      Low income Americans experience a much higher energy burden than the average American household   Too many of these households face difficult financial choices in trying to meet basic human necessities on an income that simply wont stretch far enough to cover it all   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between paying an energy bill and putting food on the table for themselves and their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances      It would be unfortunate to permit  131 million in LIHEAP contingency funds to expire given the need to help families and seniors restore service and reduce energy burdens   Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely         ,0

167,   Senators Propose New Help for Workers During Mass Layoffs   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Senators Propose New Help for Workers During Mass Layoffs Tuesday  July 17  2007  For Immediate Release  Contact  Bethany Lesser  Brown   Ben LaBolt  Obama   or Sarah Gegenheimer  Clinton  Brown  Obama  Clinton Want to Strengthen19 Year Old Plant Closing Law Washington  DC     U S  Senator Sherrod Brown  joined by Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   late last night introduced new legislation that would notify workers of mass firings or plant closings and add tools to enforce current law  The Federal Oversight  Reform  and Enforcement of the WARN Act  FOREWARN   S 1792  would amend the current Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification  WARN  Act  which became law in 1988  to better protect workers       While notice of a layoff is no substitute for a job  the WARN Act was supposed to give employees time to find a new job and for help to be provided     said Senator Brown  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee     Under current law  fair notice has proven to be the exception  not the rule  Employers have laid off workers in phases to avoid threshold level  used subsidiaries to evade liability  and pressured workers to sign documents to waive their rights  This needs to change now          For too long  employers have failed to notify workers that they   re about to lose their jobs due to mass layoffs or plant closings even though notice is required by the WARN Act     said Senator Obama     This bill will transform the WARN Act from a symbol into an enforceable law   The least employers can do when they   re anticipating layoffs is to let workers know they   re going to be out of a job and a pay check with enough time to plan for their future          Congress passed the WARN Act two decades ago to protect workers and their families from the harmful effects of sudden plant closings and mass layoffs   While the Act was designed to give workers the opportunity to adjust to the imminent loss of employment  it has become clear that the Act is not achieving that goal   The FOREWARN Act is much needed legislation that will update and modernize the law to better reflect the needs of U S  workers in a 21st century economy and ensure that workers receive the fair notice that they need and deserve     said Senator Clinton   The WARN Act now provides workers 60 days    notification in advance of plant closings and mass layoffs  Employees entitled to notice under WARN include managers and supervisors  as well as hourly and salaried workers  WARN requires that notice also be given to a union  a local elected official  and the state department of labor   According to estimates by the Government Accountability Office  GAO   24 percent of all layoffs are subject to WARN requirements  Of those layoffs  employers provided notice in approximately one third of these situations   The FOREWARN Act would give the U S  Department of Labor  DOL  and state attorneys general the authority to enforce the WARN Act  and would increase penalties to double back pay plus benefits  In addition  it would reduce the mass layoff figure from 50 to 25  reduce the employer size from 100 to 50 employees  and lower the mass layoff trigger  The lower thresholds would protect employees in many smaller manufacturing firms  It would also lengthen the notification period from 60 to 90 days and require employers to provide written notification to the Department of Labor       Job loss does not just affect a worker or a worker   s family  Job loss devastates entire communities and local economies  It is absolutely critical that in these situations  workers and groups have sufficient notice to begin working to attempt to limit the damage this causes in a community  This legislation will close the loopholes and provide the tools necessary for enforcement of the rules     Senator Brown added                                   ,1

                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC  New Jersey and New Yorks U S  Senators today successfully passed legislation that would mandate the federal government to provide answers about plans to reduce flight delays  The Senators successfully attached two amendments to the Transportation  Housing  and Urban Development Appropriations bill  which passed the Senate today  requiring the government to report on available options  which is particularly important to the New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Region  the nations most densely congestion airspace    The amendments  which will go into effect when the bill is signed into law  were spurred by record delays for the flying public this summer and major concerns that the Federal Aviation Administrations announced Airspace Redesign for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia area will increase aircraft noise while providing only minimal delay reductions    Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  were joined by Hillary Clinton  D NY  and Charles Schumer  D NY  on an amendment to ensure that the federal governments independent investigatory arm will examine the effectiveness of a variety of approaches used nationwide to reduce flight delays  The Senators said that Government Accountability Offices  GAO  report  which will be completed within 120 days of the bill being signed into law  will help determine if the Airspace Redesign plan will have a substantial effect on flight delays and whether other options used elsewhere will be more effective    Meanwhile Senator Clinton was joined by Senators Schumer  Lautenberg and Menendez on an amendment that would require the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress about how the FAA intends to reduce congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia airspace by next summer  The amendment  which was co sponsored by Senators Dodd  Lieberman  Casey and Specter  would force the FAA to come up with a plan by next summer on how they will reduce these delays  The full implementation of the Airspace Redesign plan is not scheduled to be completed until 2011  In the meantime  the FAA must come up with a plan to address congestion and delays at area airports before the implementation of the Airspace Redesign project is complete     Air travelers have spent the summer stuck in airport terminals and on the tarmac  If theres a way to more substantially reduce grueling flight delays while keeping the roaring noise of jets out of our neighborhoods  we need to know  said Senator Menendez  This will give us an independent  thorough assessment of flight delay reduction options so we can see if it has been done better in other areas  Its pretty evident that the FAAs current plan just isnt going to fly with New Jersey residents    The Bush Administration wants to sacrifice our quality of life by allowing more flights over our homes and while providing little  if any  relief to delayed travelers   That s the wrong approach  said Senator Lautenberg   Our measure will require a better study of how to improve flight delays in our region without causing excessive air noise    The Airspace Redesign Project is a major undertaking and one that has the potential to impact so many New Yorkers  but its not a silver bullet in relieving the congestion in our airspace  This summer has been awful for commercial flyers when it comes to delays and the Administration must come up with a plan to address this problem as soon as possible   We must have a plan that helps clear the skies while addressing the very serious concerns about noise levels for communities on the ground  Senator Clinton said  We cannot wait ten to fifteen years for this resolved   We must clear up the delays at our airports  stop the terrifying near misses on the ground and relieve the congestion  as well as reduce noise to surrounding communities and consider the very real impact on residents sooner rather than later    Anyone who has taken a flight recently knows that the situation in Americas airports is appalling  and its only getting worse  said Senator Schumer  Our skies are gridlocked and the FAA has done next to nothing about it  While moves toward next generation technology are promising  we cannot wait another decade for the FAA to implement changes to address this crisis  This study will force the FAA to report on how they plan to address delays in the short term  The bottom line is that the FAA let conditions deteriorate to the point of chaos  and if the administration isnt held accountable by Congress  I have little reason to believe that the situation will improve   Details of Menendez Lautenberg Clinton Schumer amendment   Directs the GAO to conduct a study of the efficacy of various approaches used in the past by the FAA and the DOT to address delays at our nation s airports   Within 120 days of enactment  the GAO is to report which strategies have worked best to comprehensively reduce flight delays at an airport within 6 months or less   Specifically  the GAO is instructed to examine efforts by the FAA to induce voluntary schedule reductions at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  the FAA s mandatory flight reduction operations at LaGuardia International Airport and Reagan National Airport  the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area Airspace Redesign and any other significant efforts by the FAA or the DOT to reduce flight delays at a major U S  international airport   Details of Clinton Schumer Lautenberg Menendez amendment   Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of

962,August 13  2007 Clinton Reiterates Opposition to Allstate Decision to Terminate Coverage for Policy Holders in Westchester  Long Island  New York City                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Calls on Allstate to Reconsider Plan which is Beginning to Impact Many Residents and Homeowners  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on Allstate Insurance Company to reconsider its decision to terminate homeowner s coverage for existing policy holders in Westchester  Long Island and New York City    Allstate announced last year that it plans to cease writing policies for new homeowners and will not renew policies for current policy holders in Westchester  Long Island  and New York City  At the time  Senator Clinton called on the Allstate leadership to reconsider and explain their irresponsible decision  As policy holders are now being denied  Senator Clinton today wrote again to Allstates CEO  calling for a detailed explanation for the companys actions  and urging the company to resume writing homeowners insurance policies for residents in Westchester  Long Island  and New York City    I am very disturbed to hear that Allstate is continuing with their plans to drop the policies of the customers in downstate New York  Westchester  Long Island and New York City have all been hit by severe floods in recent months and last weeks floods are just another reminder of how serious the threat can be to peoples homes and lives  New Yorkers who take out insurance are being responsible and they should not be penalized or have to face the impossible choice or sky high premiums or no coverage at all  Senator Clinton said    Allstates action is part of efforts begun by the company in 2006 to lower its hurricane risks along the countrys eastern coast  However  their practice has been criticized as other insurers who provide coverage in the same areas and who are exposed to the same risks have not taken similarly drastic measures  The action by Allstate also leaves their present policy holders in a bind as they must now search for new insurance carriers and face the possibility of higher premiums     A copy of Senator Clintons letter to Allstate CEO Thomas J  Wilson follows      Mr  Thomas J  Wilson  Chief Executive Officer  Allstate Insurance Company  2775 Sanders Road  Northbrook  Illinois 60062   Dear Mr  Wilson    I write you today to express my deep concern over recent actions taken by Allstate in Westchester County  Long Island  and New York City  According to recent reports  Allstate has stopped writing policies for homeowners coverage in these areas  and has dropped existing policy holders from coverage     While these efforts may be in your companys long term interests  however  it has created an immediate and significant hardship for the policyholders that you continue to drop  These policyholders will now face significantly higher premiums as they seek coverage  making it difficult for them to absorb the costs     It is my understanding that your decision was based on a hurricane risk management strategy that your company implemented last year  However  it is still not clear how the perceived risk justified your sudden decision to deny coverage to your customers in New York     Moreover  other insurers in the same areas and presumably exposed to the same risks  have not taken the extreme steps you have  These other insurers  with smaller market shares than Allstate and their risk concentrated among a significantly smaller pool of policyholders  have not dropped policies based on the threat of hurricanes    I would appreciate a detailed explanation of the decision to drop coverage for these homeowners  Further in the absence of any compelling argument for the drastic method in which existing policyholders are being dropped  I would urge you to reconsider your decision     Thank you for taking this into consideration and I look forward to your reply    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton        ,0
111,   Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers Monday  August 14  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs   202  228 5511  Date  August 14  2006  Obama Calls on FTC to Investigate Impact of BP Pipeline Closure on Consumers   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Federal Trade Commission  FTC  Chairman Deborah Platt Majoras  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Monday requested that the FTC investigate what impact BP s closure of the Prudhoe Bay pipelines along the North Slope of Alaska will have on consumers    It is clear that the closure of these pipelines   will have an effect on the economic well being of the State of Alaska and on gas prices for American consumers   Obama said   Nevertheless  last week  the President of BP America would not answer a direct question from a network reporter as to whether or not BP would pass along the costs of its mistakes to customers  despite the company recording profits of  22 6 billion last year     According to news accounts  BP did not anticipate in some cases that 20  and 30 year old pipes would require regular safety inspections using some of the latest available technology  A BP official reportedly admitted that a pipeline in operation since 1977 had never even been tested using an industry standard procedure known as  smart pigging   Had the appropriate tests been conducted  BP would likely have known that some areas of the pipes had corroded to the point of becoming  paper thin   It also appears that BP may have actually scaled back the use of costly but needed corrosion inhibitors in some of its pipelines     The news of this pipeline closure has already further increased record high gas prices for consumers across the country   said Obama   BP shouldn t make things worse by passing the cost of their mistake on to consumers     Below please find the full text of Obama s letter      August 14  2006   The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairman  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC  20580   Dear Chairman Majoras    I am writing to request that the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  investigate the impact on consumers of BP s closure of the Prudhoe Bay pipelines along the North Slope of Alaska     The FTC is charged with protecting consumers from negligent business practices that can distort prices and harm consumers   Over the last several years  the FTC has conducted several studies on high oil prices   As recently as May 2006  the FTC issued a report that concluded that oil companies were not manipulating the market or fixing prices in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   A related issue is whether short sighted efforts by companies like BP to cut corners have resulted in unnecessary environmental degradation or unfair price increases to American consumers     According to news accounts  BP did not anticipate in some cases that 20  and 30 year old pipes would require regular safety inspections using some of the latest available technology   Indeed  a BP official reportedly admitted that a pipeline in operation since 1977 had never even been tested using an industry standard procedure known as  smart pigging    Had the appropriate tests been conducted  BP would likely have known that some areas of the pipes had corroded to the point of becoming  paper thin    It also appears that BP may have actually scaled back the use of costly but needed corrosion inhibitors in some of its pipelines    Only after some 267 000 gallons of crude oil spilled on Alaska s North Slope in March 2006 did BP finally take steps to expand its inspection regime and check for possible corrosion   At that point  however  it was too late to do anything but shut down the pipelines and replace the corroded segments   Had BP taken the proper precautions  it might have been able to prevent the environmental damage caused by the leak and last week s untimely shutdown of production     It is clear that the closure of these pipelines   despite the restoration of some production capacity in recent days   will have an effect on the economic well being of the State of Alaska and on gas prices for American consumers   Nevertheless  last week  the President of BP America would not answer a direct question from a network reporter as to whether or not BP would pass along the costs of its mistakes to customers  despite the company recording profits of  22 6 billion last year     I believe that companies like BP have an essential role to play in America s energy future   Large oil companies are too important and receive too many public benefits to shirk their public responsibility   The government must ensure that the appropriate environmental protections and consumer safeguards are in place and that these companies are properly balancing the interests of shareholders and consumers   Indeed  the guarantee that American consumers will be protected from negligent and shortsighted business practices serves as a linchpin to the smooth functioning of our markets     Accordingly  I ask that the FTC investigate the consumer impact caused by BP s disregard for environmental safety and sound business planning   It is important for the FTC to assess the harm done to consumers and determine what if any steps must be taken by BP  other energy companies  regulatory agencies or Congress in order to protect the American consumer from unnecessary disruptions and price increases in the future     Please let me know by August 31  2006  whether you will agree to open such an investigation   Thank you     Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                    ,1

                     Washington  DC   US Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  17 75 million in the FY06 Defense Department Appropriations bill for projects to benefit the Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes regions   The House has approved the bill   The Senate is expected to work on the Defense Appropriations bill this week   If the bill is passed  it will be sent to the President for his signature            Projects to be funded under the bill include   1 65 million for Oblique Angle Hyperspectral Image Fusion and Analysis for Change Detection research at Virtual Scopics   1 million to Integrated Nano Technologies for Bio Warfare Testing   3 million to RIT  s Defense Systems Modernization and Sustainment Initiative   2 million to General Motors for Next Generation Non Tactial Vehicle Propulsion   2 million for Photon Gear  s Agile Laser Eye Protection project  2 million to the National Center for Infotonics   5 1 million for Icuiti  s Advanced Multipurpose Microdisplay and  1 million for VirtualScopics   Work Flow Engine for Off Line Image Analysis             This is great news for the Finger Lakes   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Finger Lakes and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Finger Lakes defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge              The Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes regions have already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support              Photon Gear will receive  2 million in federal funds for Agile Laser Eye Protection research  Hostile use of lasers against U S  military assets to inflict injury  damage targeting sensors  and mission denial through dazzling of personnel   sensors are growing threats  The eyesight of aircrew and electro optical sensors are of particular concern due to their susceptibility to damage  Currently available laser eye protection targets known  fixed wavelength laser threats  While a fieldable  day only Agile form of laser eye protection is nearing completion  there is an urgent need for an integrated frequency agile form of laser eye protection that simultaneously protects during both day and night operations  An intensified frequency agile device would ultimately provide cost savings to the military by eliminating the need for different protection to cover all the potential wavelengths suitable for day and night time use  Funding will go towards the development of an intensified frequency agile device that would eliminate the need for different protection to cover all the potential wavelengths suitable for day and night time use            Virtual Scopics will receive  1 65 million in federal funds for Oblique Angle Hyperspectral Image Fusion and Analysis for Change Detection research  Current hyperspectral targeting systems must fly directly over targets and are therefore vulnerable to shoot down  They are also vulnerable to deception using two dimensional decoys  These funds will support the development of systems that will permit targeting at long range thus reducing risk to targeting system from shoot down  These systems will also develop novel image registration capabilities in order to perform change detection and three dimensional modeling             1 million is provided in the bill for Integrated Nanotechnology of Henrietta for its Bio Warfare Testing program  This funding would support the development of a Special Operations Field Biological Agent Identification System  a light weight  portable  highly reliable system for detection and identification of specific biological agents in support of Special Operations Command  would locate  identify and render safe weapons of mass destruction           The Rochester Institute of Technology  RIT  will receive  3 million in federal funds for the Defense Systems Modernization and Sustainment Initiative  The objective of this research program is to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems  The Department of Defense  while developing new systems that will enable a leap ahead or transformation in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems  The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the staggering replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems  This research program provides DOD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles  Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems            2 million in federal funds will go to General Motors for the Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion initiative  Funding will support the design  development and demonstration of next generation non tactical vehicle propulsion technology to enhance mission performance capability  increase fuel economy and reduce exhaust emissions of U S  military non tactical vehicles at U S  military installations  Following on development begun last year  the initiative proposes to demonstrate two commercially based non tactical SUV style vehicles with a single front wheel drive utilizing the latest designs in the fuel cell power unit  The General Motors light truck evaluated in this demonstration will utilize fuel cells designed and built in Honeoye Falls  NY            2 million in federal funds will be awarded to the National Center for Infotonics  Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems of the military  Funding will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies  Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications          5 1 million in federal funds will go to Icuiti for the Advanced Multipurpose Microdisplay System  Special Operations Forces employ a vast array of sophisticated sensors such as thermal and infrared devices  video from unmanned aerial vehicles  and massive amounts of digital information from sensors used to detect targets or nuclear  biological  and chemical threats   Special Operations Forces urgently need a SOF Counter proliferation Visualization System that will integrate advanced microdisplay and miniature electronics with a heads up display  personal digital assistant computer  wireless communication  and a target vector head tracking system for advanced  hands free situation awareness   Icuiti Corporation has a new microdisplay based low profile lens system that can be integrated into a standard pair of sunglasses   Special Operations users could view data from a variety of sources  without anyone knowing they are wearing it   Covert operators could receive real time mission and sensor information without any risk of compromising their status  First prototype articles are scheduled for delivery to USSOCOM by the end of this calendar year   This funding will help finish the development of the lens and display system            1 million in federal funds will go towards VirtualScopics   Work Flow Engine for Off Line Image Analysis   Currently deployed sensor systems generate far more image data than can be effectively analyzed in a timely fashion currently   There is a critical need for a flexible  user configurable image analysis system for off line analysis of collected surveillance and reconnaissance data  VirtualScopics has a unique combination of expertise in workflow engine design for efficient image analysis  image analysis automation  and task specific issues related to analysis of hyperspectral optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar   The project will develop a task configurable end to end image analysis system incorporating data management  spectral detection for minefields  chemical plumes  etc   and assisted target recognition   Such a system could be of high utility both to stateside analysts and to the warfighter in the field            ,0
321,   Obama Works to Expand Use of Biofuels Nationwide   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Works to Expand Use of Biofuels Nationwide Monday  March 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Contact  Ben LaBolt  Urges Underwriters Laboratories to certify  blender pumps  to make E85 fuels more accessible to motorists across the country  WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Barack Obama was today joined by Senators Durbin  D IL   Harkin  D IA   Lugar  R IN   Bayh  D IN   Nelson  D NE   Grassley  R IA   Klobuchar  D MN   Thune  R SD   Feingold  D WI   McCaskill  D MO   Voinovich  R OH   Brown  D OH   and Brownback  R KS  in urging Underwriters Laboratories  UL   the world s leading product safety testing organization  to complete its certification process for the multi product fuel dispensers that allow service stations to sell higher ethanol blends up to E85    an 85  ethanol 15  traditional gasoline blend   Several years ago  UL approved the use of multi product fuel dispenser components only to rescind that certification on October 5  2006  announcing it would reconsider whether to certify the dispensers even though there were no documented problems       American manufacturers are doing their part to lead the United States toward energy independence by increasing the use of biofuels  but some roadblocks remain     said U S  Senator Barack Obama      While the biofuels industry will soon produce enough ethanol to make higher fuel blends widely available to consumers  and automakers have steadily increased the production of Flexible Fuel Vehicles  just over 1 000 retailers across the nation carry E85 pumps    UL certification will remove one of the last remaining roadblocks to the widespread installation of dual fuel pumps that give motorists the choice between renewable fuels and traditional gasoline      Approximately 1 100 service stations are equipped to dispense E85 in the U S  today   Congress has enacted a federal income tax credit to offset the cost for service stations of installing of E85 fueling systems  and many states have lowered excise tax rates and provided other incentives to advance E85   But UL s decision to rescind its previously issued E85 certifications and uncertainty as to when its current certification review will be completed has caused some fire marshals  code administrators  and other officials cross the nation to block the installation of new E85 fueling systems   In their letter to Keith Williams  President and CEO of Underwriters Laboratory  the senators wrote     We appreciate that you and your staff have undertaken a new effort to establish E85 component and dispenser testing protocol  but we are extremely disappointed that this initiative is being undertaken after the withdrawal of the prior approvals      Given UL s admission that there has never been an E85 fueling system failure  a report of such failure  or even evidence of corrosion in E85 fueling systems  the decision to rescind the prior approvals while you carry out new testing is troubling     We believe it is in the national interest for UL to either re issue the prior certifications that were available to E85 dispensing equipment or document why it believes these pumps are unsafe  establish a firm timetable to complete its updated testing and analysis  and issue a revised draft protocol to industry as soon as practicable      Sen  Obama has noted that that Brazil is a prime example of a nation that has successfully expanded its infrastructure for distributing higher ethanol blends  from E30 to E85  in special pumps that allow motorists to select what blend of biofuels they want  depending upon cost and availability   Nearly all automobiles manufactured in Brazil today are FFV s  or Flexible Fuel Vehicles  which means they are designed to run efficiently on any blend of ethanol or gasoline    Twenty years from now our nation s transportation fuels sector will be powered primarily by domestically produced biofuels  if we have the vision and the will to make that happen   Obama said    Just as we sent a man to the moon  we can harness our technological skills and entrepreneurial spirit to end our dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil   In doing so  we will not only protect our national security  we will also protect our public health  create quality jobs for the next generations  and keep billions of dollars here at home  rather than sending them to nations that want to do us harm    In his State of the Union Address last January  President Bush identified the use of higher ethanol blends  including E85  as one of the nation   s leading alternatives to hydrocarbon based transportation fuels and proposed requiring 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels be used in U S  fuels by 2017   This critical goal cannot be met without making these fuels more readily available to motorists  and  as a practical matter  that access is dependent upon UL certification of E85 dispensing equipment   A copy of the letter to Keith Williams  President and CEO of Underwriters Laboratory is embedded below  Mr  Keith Williams  President and CEO  Underwriters Laboratory  333 Pfingsten Road  Northbrook  Illinois 60062 2096 Dear Mr  Williams  We are writing in regard to the recent decision by Underwriter Laboratories  UL  to rescind its previously issued certifications for components of E85 refueling systems  and the new efforts by UL to establish E85 component and fuel dispenser testing protocols   UL initiated a review of the safety of multi product fuel dispenser components and approved their use several years ago   On October 5  2006  UL rescinded the certification for these components and announced that it would embark on an extended recertification procedure for the dispensers themselves   We understand that re evaluation of material testing protocol is not uncommon and indeed should occur in the normal course of time  and we appreciate that you and your staff have undertaken a new effort to establish E85 component and dispenser testing protocol   We are concerned  however  why this initiative is being undertaken after the withdrawal of the prior approvals     especially when UL has acknowledged no documented reports of corrosion for UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  no field incidents related to UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  and no reported safety issues associated with Listed or Recognized components used with E85 Moreover  the actions taken by UL have not provided equipment manufacturers  ethanol producers  and the motoring public with adequate certainty and clarity as to the timetable for completion of the process   We know and agree that any device that displays the UL imprimatur must have its characteristics fully reviewed and tested according to key standards and procedures   We request your assurances that both timetable and testing are not mutually exclusive goals   Congress has taken significant steps to transition to alternative fuels such as E 85   setting mandatory targets for increased ethanol use  enacting a federal income tax credit to offset the cost of installation of E85 fueling systems  and funding efforts to expand E 85 refueling infrastructure nationwide  of which now there are more than 1 100 pumps   UL is essential to these transition efforts     UL has tested products for public safety for more than a century and has earned its well deserved reputation as an unbiased gatekeeper for the introduction of American innovation in the marketplace                                       ,1
799,July 11  2005 Senator Clinton joins University of Rochester Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson to Announce Research Partnership                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Rochester  NY A unique fund to nurture research and technologies that have the potential to lead to new health care products is being established at the University of Rochester Medical Center through a partnership with Johnson   Johnson   The Medical Center today announced that a   Discovery Concept Fund    is being created to target promising early stage research generally conducted by junior scientists who have ideas but often do not have ready access to funding             World class biomedical research institutions  such as the University of Rochester Medical Center  are engines of innovation     said Ted Torphy  corporate vice president for science and technology at Johnson   Johnson    The objective of this partnership is to both support this process of discovery and accelerate the translation of research into products for patients   We believe long term collaborative partnerships between the academic and the private sector will be increasingly important in advancing breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of serious disease  We share the same fundamental goal of bringing better treatment to patients               This partnership comes at a time when the University of Rochester Medical Center and other biomedical research institutions are facing significant funding challenges   While the Medical Center has doubled its total research funding over the last seven years to  210 million   142 million of which came from the National Institutes of Health  NIH   the rate of growth has decelerated in recent years due to the leveling off of the NIH budget             The Medical Center has made an enormous investment in recent years to expand our research capabilities     said David Guzick  M D   Ph D  dean of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry    As we look to the future  we are compelled to seek out private sources of revenue which will enable us to grow our biomedical research enterprises   This partnership will also help us better utilize the talents of our faculty and our research infrastructure to translate innovative discoveries into useful technologies and treatments that can be used by patients around the world                An example of the potential of this partnership was on display today as it was separately announced that the Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson were moving forward on a  1 6 million joint research project   This project will utilize a process developed by Howard Federoff  M D   Ph D  senior associated dean for basic science research at the Medical Center  which can target activity in neurons that prevent the repair of the central nervous system following spinal cord injury or trauma to the brain   This application of this process also has the potential to lead to the development of new classes of drugs             I want to congratulate University of Rochester Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson on this partnership announcement and on the creation of the Discovery Concept Fund  This is an incredible gift  not only to UMRC  but to the entire biomedical research community and to the Greater Rochester region     said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  who joined with officials from the University of Rochester Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson for today  s announcement    It is also a great example of what we can achieve when academia and industry work together   further enhancing Rochester s reputation as a world class center for biotechnology research  fostering a new generation of scientists and building on the region s growth potential  I look forward to watching this winning partnership thrive          Discovery Concept Fund    The Discovery Concept Fund will be jointly administered by Johnson   Johnson and the University of Rochester Medical Center and will be funded on a renewable basis by Johnson   Johnson              Johnson   Johnson is committed to supporting biomedical institutions  as demonstrated by the  50 million in grants we have awarded researchers in the last twenty years     said Torphy    The University of Rochester Medical Center is one of a few select partners for the Discovery Concept Fund   Based on the quality of their science and an environment for collaboration and entrepreneurship  the only limit in our relationship that I can see will be the amount of innovation that its scientists can produce              The fund will solicit proposals from Medical Center scientists with the objective of nurturing early stage research and technologies that have the potential to impact health care   In doing so  it will target researchers  particularly junior scientists  who often have difficulty competing with their more established colleagues for research grants  Johnson   Johnson has stated that it will not limit the number of meritorious applications it will fund             This agreement is truly mutually beneficial     said Guzick    A major problem faced by industry is access to new concepts or novel approaches that lay the foundation for new medical breakthroughs  On the flip side  scientists who have a concept or idea that could provide a solution to a specific problem often lack funding to evaluate and advance their research              The fund will be governed by a committee consisting of equal members from both the Medical Center and Johnson

1856,"TO SAVE THE PLANET, LISTEN TO THE SCIENTISTS
  A Senate panel on Wednesday took up global warming legislation. To Vermont's own Bill McKibben, a national leader on the environment and climate change, it's about time. ""Long after the Nobel-winning reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, long after Hurricane Katrina, long after 'An Inconvenient Truth, they're finally taking up the single biggest question that the planet faces,"" he wrote. Senator Bernie Sanders, the sponsor of the strongest legislation on climate change, is a member of the subcommittee. ""Let me be as blunt as I can be in telling you where I am coming from on this bill,"" he said at the outset of the hearing. 
   ""On most issues, Congress goes through the time-honored tradition of working out compromises which both sides can end up accepting. The issue is not what I want versus what Senator Lieberman or Senator Warner or Senator Inhofe may want - and the need to work out an agreement that we can all accept. That's not the dynamic we face today. The issue today is one of physics and chemistry and what the best scientists in the world believe is happening to our planet because of greenhouse gas emissions.  
   ""I want to see all the kids in America have health care. Other members think the SCHIP program should not be expanded. We compromise on 4 million more children in the program. I think a program should be expanded by $100 million. You think it should be expanded by $50 million. We compromise at $75 million. That's the way business is done here and in other democratic societies and there is nothing wrong with that. We live in a country where people have different political views and in almost every instance members of the Senate compromise to reach an agreement.
   ""Today, however, we have a qualitatively different situation. I wish it wasn't so, but it is. The issue is not what I want versus what Senator Lieberman or Senator Warner or Senator Inhofe may want - and the need to work out an agreement that we can all accept. That's not the dynamic we face today. The issue today is one of physics and chemistry and what the best scientists in the world believe is happening to our planet because of greenhouse gas emissions. The issue is what we can do, as a nation, along with the international community, to reverse global warming and to save this planet from a catastrophic and irreversible damage which could impact billions of people.
   ""In other words, we are not in a debate now between Bernie Sanders and anyone else. It's not a debate between what I want or what you want. We are in a debate between science and public policy. And the views that I am bringing forth, to the best of my ability, are the views of the most knowledgeable scientists in America and the world: the people who, among other achievements, have just received the Nobel Peace Prize. 
   ""Let me talk about my biggest concerns with the legislation.
   ""First, I understand that different experts are analyzing the reductions from all provisions of the bill, but it is my view that the 2020 target should be at least a 15 percent mandatory, under the cap, reduction from total current U.S. emissions. Many are starting to say that we need near-term reductions more on the order of 20-30 percent of total U.S. emissions, so 15 percent is rather modest. Additionally, the 2050 target should be at least an 80 percent mandatory, under the cap, reduction from total U.S. emissions in 1990. In addition to thinking about the reduction targets and timelines, we must ensure that the latest science is periodically considered and that it informs our ongoing action, the so-called ""look-back"" process. 
   ""Secondly, right now, the legislation transitions to 100 percent auction or public benefit by 2036, over 20 years after enactment. The right to pollute should not be given away, at least not for so long, and thus I want to see 100 percent auction or public benefit by, at the very latest, 2025.
   ""Third, the bill, as currently drafted, allows a firm to get 15 percent of its reductions from offsets - projects that can be difficult to track and quantify - and this worries me. It especially worries me when I consider that the legislation also allows another 15 percent of a firm's allowances to be borrowed from the future and another 15 percent to come from international markets. Mr. Chairman, with only a few very quantifiable exceptions, I would be hesitant to rely on offsets to meet our emission reduction goals.
   ""Fourth, the bad news is that we have a huge crisis in front of us. The very good news is that as a result of exceptional work and technology breakthroughs, we now have the tools - at our fingertips - to reverse global warming as we move from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and such sustainable energy sources as wind, solar, geothermal and others. Mr. Chairman, a recent report on a poll, entitled, 'A Post Fossil-Fuel America: Are Americans Ready to Make the Shift?,' found that 88 percent of Americans think that it is time for 'our nation to start thinking in terms of the concept of a 'new industrial revolution,' one that is characterized by the orderly phasing out of fossil fuels and the phasing in of clean, renewable energy sources - many of which are available now, such as wind and solar for electricity.' I couldn't agree more with this finding. 
   ""What does this actually mean - moving to more sustainable sources of energy?
   It means that within 10 years, we should have at least 10 million solar rooftops producing clean, cheap, and secure electricity.
   ""It means that we should be building more solar plants - right now we have only 2, with one having just come on line this June.
   ""It means that we should produce, in this country, millions of small wind turbines that could be used in rural America to provide, on average, 50 percent of the electricity a household might need.
   ""It means that we should be seriously investing in energy efficiency - in our homes, our workplaces, our factories, and our transportation systems. For example, we should focus attention on our rail system to help break our dependence on the automobile.
   ""If we are going to implement these bold policies and achieve these aggressive goals; if we are going to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, the federal government will have to play a leadership role in moving our nation forward. The Lieberman-Warner bill creates a Climate Change Credit Corporation which will administer tens of billions of dollars in auction proceeds. I am very concerned about the structure and accountability of this Climate Change Credit Corporation, and whether it can accomplish what we need to see accomplished in a cost-effective and accountable manner 
   ""In my view, we need more than a passive grant-maker. We need a federal entity that can be a partner with the private sector, with states and localities and with the non-profit community, an entity that has the authority and the flexibility to transform our energy future and reverse global warming. I look forward to working with you.""

136,   Obama Introduces Legislation to Help Property Owners Safeguard Against Lead Hazards in the Home   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Introduces Legislation to Help Property Owners Safeguard Against Lead Hazards in the Home Friday  November 18  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  November 18  2005  Obama Introduces Legislation to Help Property Owners Safeguard Against Lead Hazards in the Home   Washington  DC   Today  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Mike DeWine  R OH  and Gordon Smith  R OR  introduced legislation providing a tax credit for safely removing lead based paint hazards from homes and rental units   This bipartisan bill would provide needed incentives for property owners to ensure that homes are free of environmental hazards that can harm children    As both a father of two young daughters and a lawmaker  it pains me to think that each year nearly 28 000 children needlessly suffer from lead paint poisoning   said Obama   We need to take immediate action to protect our children by ensuring that dangerous lead paint is cleaned up properly      This bill will help to achieve the federal government s established goal of eliminating toxic blood levels in young children by 2010   Exposure in the home is the number one source of lead for young children   By providing financial incentives to remove lead hazards from the home  exposure will be minimized and this disease  which is known to have incredibly harmful effects on child development  behavior and intelligence  can be prevented   We need to continue to work to end childhood lead poisoning and to ensure safe and healthy environments for our children   said Senator Clinton     As parents  we try to protect our kids as much as possible when they walk out the front door  when they re on the roads  or when they re on the playground with friends   But one of the biggest health risks to our kids can occur inside the home   said Senator DeWine    Dangerous lead paint exposures are entirely preventable   It just makes sense that we encourage parents to remove this hazard and protect our children      Lead poisoning is all the more tragic because it is preventable   Smith said    The homes where lead paint is most common are often the ones with families who lack the resources to remove it   It will take years to entirely remove this hazard  but we can get it done more quickly with a boost in financial support     This bill would change the IRS code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for 50  of the allowable costs paid by the taxpayer  up to a maximum of  3000 for lead abatement and  1000 for interim control measures  which could include window replacement  safe repainting and specialized renovation work practices to reduce lead hazards   These are cost effective means of protecting the largest number of children in the near term   The credit is targeted to homes with children younger than six years of age  women of childbearing age  low income residents  and buildings built before 1960  as these include more than 96  of all units where lead based paint is prevalent     Lead is highly toxic and continues to be a major preventable environmental health threat especially to infants  children  and pregnant women in the United States  Lead poisoning can be deadly  and almost one million children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  that can impair their growth and the function of vital organs and motor skills   The most common source of lead exposure for children today is lead paint in older housing and the contaminated lead dust it generates   Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still millions of housing units in the United States that contain lead paint  especially in older homes        Illinois has the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  According to an Illinois Department of Public Health report  Illinois amounted to 20 5 percent of all elevated blood levels reported nationwide  The report also found that African American children are more than three times as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels and Hispanic children are more than twice as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels    In New York State  about five percent of children screened for lead poisoning at age two were found to have elevated blood lead levels  more than twice the national average   New York counties where kids are especially at risk include  Onondaga  Fulton  Monroe  Erie  and Oneida  Approximately 10 000 cases of childhood lead poisoning in New York are found each year   Minority and poor children are disproportionately at risk   For example  in New York City  about 95  of children with elevated blood levels were African American  Hispanic or Asian    Senator Clinton and her colleagues have a strong record of advocacy on environmental health issues  Earlier this year  Senators Clinton and DeWine introduced the Family Asthma Act  which seeks to increase research into the links between environmental pollutants and the growing epidemic of asthma  And yesterday  Senators Obama and Clinton introduced the Healthy Communities Act  which would establish Health Action Zones to address environmental health concerns in our nation s most affected communities  Senator Clinton has also introduced the bipartisan Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act to strengthen the environmental health tracking program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention                                   ,1

1957,"SEN. SANDERS DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM AEI ON OFFER TO PAY OFF SCIENTISTS TO DISPUTE REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE
  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) issued a letter today to the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), demanding answers from AEI about news accounts that it offered $10,000 to scientists to dispute a report on climate change issued by the United Nations, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and John Kerry (D-MA) joined Sanders in signing the letter. 
   According to the Guardian (London, UK), which first reported the story, ""Scientists and economists have been offered $10,000 each by a lobby group funded by one of the world's largest oil companies to undermine a major climate change report due to be published today. Letters sent by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an ExxonMobil-funded thinktank [sic] with close links to the Bush administration, offered the payments for articles that emphasise [sic] the shortcomings of a report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."" Link
   Sanders said, ""It's outrageous that a right-wing think tank with ties to Big Oil and the Bush Administration is trying to twist scientific findings for their political purposes on the pressing issue of climate change. The IPCC report confirms the urgency of the problem and adds to the scientific consensus that global warming is happening now and is human-caused. Is there no limit to the lengths that some corporate-funded groups will go to protect their donors' short-term profits? Is the fate of the entire planet not important enough for them to put the common interest above their narrow self-interest? The truth is that this scandalous behavior on the part of AEI is just the latest example of how big money interests distort and undermine honest debate on the important issues facing our country in so many areas.""

1754,"KEEPING FAITH WITH VETERANS
  Joined by Vermont veterans' advocates, Sen. Bernie Sanders announced at a press conference in his Burlington Senate office the introduction of the Comprehensive Veterans Benefits Improvement Act. The legislation, crafted with input from veterans' service organizations, would improve health care, insurance, housing, pensions and other benefits. 
   The Sanders bill would make more than two dozen changes to veterans' programs ranging from disability payments, to insurance premiums, to grants for disabled veterans to adapt their cars.
   ""This sweeping veterans legislation begins to address the inadequate benefits and other important assistance programs that this country provides to our veterans and their families,"" Sanders said. ""This legislation was written with the active help of the major veterans' organizations, the people who work with our veterans on a daily basis and have a strong understanding of the needs of that community.""
   A member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Sanders said his legislation is ""the least we can do to show our appreciation for those who sacrifice for their country.""
   Among the issues addressed in the Sanders bill is the backlog of more than 400,000 claims at the Veterans Administration, a number certain to rise as service members return from war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan.
   ""The answer to improving the processing time and the claims backlog is not to fast track one group of veterans at the expense of another group of veterans. Instead we must create a system that handles claims in a timely and accurate way,"" Sanders said. ""This is a huge problem and we must address it now. Having veterans waiting months and years to get their claims processed is unacceptable and a national disgrace.""
   The legislation would improve the claims process by modernizing the system for the Veterans Affairs Department and the Defense Department to share information. More accurate information and faster claims processing would dramatically improve healthcare services for veterans.
   Sanders was joined at the press conference by Ed Laviletta, VFW national legislative officer for Vermont; Winston Dowland, Vermont Disabled American Veterans legislative chairman and past department commander; and Marvin Minkler, a members of Sanders' Veterans Advisory Council.

1773,"SEN. SANDERS SAYS CONGRESS SHOULD REPEAL PRESIDENT'S TAX BREAKS FOR WEALTHIEST 1 PERCENT OF INCOME TAXPAYERS
  As Americans raced to file income tax returns by the filing deadline, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Congress should repeal President Bush's tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent of income taxpayers. Repealing the Bush tax breaks for the top 1 percent now would yield $378.5 billion from 2007 through 2010, when the tax law expires. These tax breaks include the estate tax, capital gains, dividends and income taxes, according to Citizens for Tax Justice.  
   ""We should rescind the hundreds of billions of tax breaks that President Bush has given the wealthiest 1 percent, and use that money to begin addressing the long-neglected problems of our children and working families,"" Sanders said. 
   Partly because of the tax laws, the gap between the rich and the poor in the United States is as wide as it has been since the Roaring Twenties. In 2005, the latest year for which figures are available, the top 1 percent of American households, those with average incomes of $1.1 million a year, received more than one-fifth of the nation's income. That is the largest share since 1929, the year the stock market collapsed and the United States sank into the Great Depression. 
   ""Today we have, by far, the most unequal distribution of wealth and income of any major country, and the gap between the rich and poor is growing wider,"" Sanders added. ""This is an issue that Congress has ignored for too long and that must be addressed."" 
   Sanders has proposed legislation to expand opportunities for the middle-class, lower the poverty rate and keep commitments to veterans, senior citizens, children's health care and other national priorities by repealing tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans while expanding tax relief for working families. 
   Sanders' legislation, The National Priorities Act of 2007, also would redirect $60 billion in the Pentagon budget by ending outdated Cold War-era weapons programs and eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders' legislation also would devote a portion of the restored revenue - $30 billion - to reduce the federal deficit.

Contact  Natalie Ravitz  Boxer                                                                                        Shana Marchio  Bond     Ben LaBolt  Obama

Senators led by Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Kit Bond  R MO  today expressed deep concern to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates about the state of mental health care services for soldiers at Ft  Carson  Colorado   In December  the Senators wrote to Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs William Winkenwerder after National Public Radio  NPR  aired a story detailing the failure of officials at Ft  Carson to provide adequate treatment for soldiers suffering from service connected mental health problems  including Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD     And last week  the Senators  along with Senators Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Hillary Clinton  D NY   and John Kerry  D MA   dispatched their staff to Ft  Carson to meet with soldiers and commanding officers to investigate allegations of inadequate mental health care for troops       Our troops are risking their lives for this country  and the sad reality is they are not being given the mental health care services they need and deserve to stay healthy and strong     Senator Boxer said      This problem is not unique to Ft  Carson   clearly we need to be doing more across the board to improve mental health services for our Armed Forces  and to do that we need a strong commitment from the Secretary of Defense   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans        A growing number of service members at Ft  Carson and throughout our military hospitals are returning from war with serious psychological injuries that must not go untreated  to say nothing of those who are going undiagnosed and falling between the cracks     said Senator Obama      We must implement comprehensive reforms that boost mental health resources and training at our military bases  reduce the strain on our troops and provide early detection  treatment and counseling for those who are affected   That s why I ve called for individual  face to face mental health screenings for all returning service members and for important new pre and post deployment screenings for traumatic brain injuries          When it comes to the poor treatment of some of our soldiers returning from combat  the revelations presented to my staff make Walter Reed look like a minor plot in a greater tragedy     said Senator Bond      The military   s handling of some soldiers suffering from mental health problems is unacceptable   We cannot allow the government to continue to fail these soldiers and their families who have sacrificed so much for this country          We have no greater moral obligation than to provide the best care to our soldiers     Senator Lieberman said      Many of them are facing mental health issues and we must provide them with timely and state of the art care  I was pleased by the commitment of the leadership at Ft  Carson to investigate any mishandling of service members    cases and I am committed to working with them and my Senate colleagues to ensure that our soldiers and military leadership have the resources they need to cope with the signature injuries of this war          We have a duty to our wounded warriors to reform and ready the military for the increasing number of veterans suffering from complex injuries like traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder     said Senator Clinton      After a recent Congressional staff delegation visit to Fort Carson  it is clear that much more remains to be done to improve access to mental health care for our wounded service members  to address the stigma that surrounds mental health issues  and to educate commanders on how to deal with soldiers suffering from these types of injuries          We must address all the wounds of war of our heroes when they return home     including the less visible ones  PTSD and traumatic brain injuries  I   m optimistic that this was a productive meeting   Major General Hammond and the leadership at the meeting listened intently to our concerns about access to mental health services for our soldiers     Senator Kerry said      This was an important step forward  and we feel strongly the military knows we mean business and they   ll work with Congress to make sure we are doing everything possible to support our soldiers and veterans  We urge the Secretary of Defense to listen and get our troops the care they need and deserve      The Senators today sent the following letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asking him to ensure that Ft  Carson is given the resources and direction necessary to provide an optimal level of care for our service members    May 22  2007  The Honorable Robert Gates   Secretary of Defense   1000 Defense Pentagon   Washington  DC 20301  Dear Secretary Gates   In recent months  troubling allegations have surfaced at Ft  Carson  Colorado  suggesting that soldiers are not receiving adequate care for mental health problems incurred as a result of combat service in Iraq and Afghanistan   Specifically  soldiers have asserted that they are not receiving comprehensive treatment for Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI  and mental health issues  such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD    They have also alleged that the command climate discourages soldiers from seeking help for these problems   As a result  we dispatched members of our staff to Ft  Carson last week to investigate these claims   While Ft  Carson has taken some important steps to improve care for soldiers   including implementing mandatory TBI screening and enhancing the pre  and post deployment screening process  the reality remains that the base is facing significant challenges in providing mental health care services   The Department of Defense Mental Health Task Force recently found that the stigma of mental illness and injury is pervasive across our Armed Forces   and Ft  Carson is proving to be no exception   After meeting with soldiers as well as commanders at the base  our staff concluded that the stigma of mental illness is a significant barrier to care   They also determined there is a considerable lack of resources to adequately support the psychological needs of our service members and their families  and a lack of training and education regarding mental health problems for leaders from the division level to the unit level   These issues are severely impairing the ability of our Army and the Department of Defense to produce and maintain the best trained and equipped military fighting force in the world   While visiting the base  our staff received a commitment from Major General Jeffrey Hammond  Commander 4th Infantry Division  that he will investigate claims of command intimidation and lack of access to timely mental health services   They also received his commitment to train military personnel on the mental health challenges many of our service members face   While we are pleased at this commitment  it is apparent that the challenges at Ft  Carson cannot be solved by General Hammond alone   Therefore  we urge you to ensure that Ft  Carson and every other military installation facing similar problems are given the resources and direction necessary to provide an optimal level of care for our service members   We will be following up with a more detailed staff report on Ft  Carson in the near future  and we expect the Department of Defense to immediately review those findings and take appropriate action to see that any and all problems are corrected   Congress and the American people have made clear  especially following the revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center  that substandard care for injured service members will not be tolerated   These men and women have stood up for our country  and we have no greater obligation than to stand with them and their families in their hours of greatest need   Please respond as soon as possible to indicate your plans to address these issues   Sincerely   Senator Barbara Boxer   Senator Barack Obama   Senator Christopher Bond   Senator Joseph Lieberman   Senator Hillary Clinton   Senator John Kerry                                    ,1

1713,"SEN. SANDERS STANDS UP TO DRUG COMPANIES
  Sen. Bernie Sanders voted against a Food and Drug Administration bill that failed to legalize the importation of lower-priced drugs from Canada and other countries. He told The New York Times he was ""extremely disappointed"" that the bill did not legalize imports. The bill also fails to curtail advertising that drives up drug spending, and paves the way for the FDA to block state laws, like one in Vermont, permitting the use of marijuana for medical purposes. ""Safe drugs are obviously important, and there are a lot of good provisions in this bill,"" Sanders told the Washington Post. ""But a safe drug doesn't mean anything to somebody who can't afford it."" 
   Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer organization, said: ""The bill's improvements in F.D.A. authority are important but inadequate,"" according to the Times article. ""Billy Tauzin, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main trade group for manufacturers of brand name drugs, applauded the passage, of the bill, saying it 'will preserve and even strengthen the F.D.A.'s ability to do its job.' ""
   Sanders was the lone senator to stand up to the powerful prescription drug lobby. The pharmaceutical industry used its army of lobbyists to gut the importation provision that Sanders has fought for since he first took a group of Vermonters to Canada to buy low-cost, FDA-approved medicine.
   ""We took a busload of Vermonters, mostly woman, many of them struggling with breast cancer, and we went from St. Albans to Montreal. I will never forget the look on the faces of those women who were struggling for their lives, when they bought breast cancer medicine at 10 percent of the cost that they were paying in the State of Vermont. The drug was tamoxifen, a widely prescribed drug for those people struggling with breast cancer,"" Sanders said.
   ""How do you have a drug manufactured by a company, manufactured in the same factory, put in the same bottles, sold in Canada for one-tenth of the price that that same medicine is sold in the United States of America? How can that happen?,"" Sanders asked.

595,   Obama  Clinton Introduce Legislation to Get Dangerous Lead Out of Child Care Facilities   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Clinton Introduce Legislation to Get Dangerous Lead Out of Child Care Facilities Tuesday  October  3  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Clinton Contact   202  224 2243  Date  October 3  2006  Obama  Clinton Introduce Legislation to Get Dangerous Lead Out of Child Care Facilities  Estimated that 14 Percent of Child care Facilities Contain Toxic Lead   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today said that they have introduced legislation that would help protect children from lead poisoning by requiring that all non home based child care facilities  including Head Start program locations and kindergarten classrooms  be lead safe within five years  The legislation would establish a  42 6 million grant program to help local communities pay to make these facilities safe    For decades  we ve known that lead is poisonous to young children  but 30 years after we banned lead from paint  millions of children are still at risk when they re in day care or at school   said Obama   This legislation will make sure that our kids are protected from lead  and that local communities have the funding they need to make sure these facilities are safe      It is critical that we remove lead hazards where our children live  learn and play   We know that lead poisoning can devastate our children s ability to learn  grow and develop and we need to eliminate these risks and hazards that continue to persist in child care facilities and schools  New York City and Rochester have been at the forefront of grassroots efforts to combat lead poisoning  and this bill would provide important resources and incentives to implement lead prevention programs nationwide   said Senator Clinton    According to the Centers for Disease Control  about 310 000 children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  with poor and minority children disproportionately at risk  The problem of lead contamination is especially great in the Midwest and Northeast where 40 percent of child care centers were built prior to 1960    Illinois has the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  According to an Illinois Department of Public Health report  Illinois amounted to 20 5 percent of all elevated blood levels reported nationwide  The report also found that African American children are more than three times as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels and Hispanic children are more than twice as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels    Each year in New York State  an additional 10 000 children under the age of six are newly identified as having elevated blood lead levels  and over 200 000 children in New York have had documented lead poisoning between 1992 and 2004  Exposure to lead results in increased expenses each year for New York in the form of special education and other education expenses  medical care for lead poisoned children  and expenditures for delinquent youth and other needing special supervision  It is estimated that these increased expenses  as well as lost earnings  exceed  4 billion annually     The Lead Poisoning Reduction Act of 2006 requires all non home based child care facilities to be certified lead safe in five years   It establishes a five year   42 6 million grant program to help communities reduce lead exposure in day care centers  Head Start programs and kindergartens   It also establishes best practices for communities to test for and reduce lead hazards    Lead paint in older buildings is a primary source of exposure  but significant lead exposure can also come from tap water   Lead is rarely found in the source water used for public water supplies  but more commonly enters tap water as a result of corrosion of water lines  pipes  and household plumbing   Lead in drinking water can be a significant source of lead exposure  and can account for as much as 60 percent of the exposure for infants and children who consume formula and concentrated juices   Children suffer the greatest negative health impacts  since lead adversely impacts physical and mental development  decreased intelligence  behavioral problems  and can also lead to kidney damage  anemia  reproductive disorders  seizures  coma  and even death       Nearly 12 million children under age 5 spend 40 hours a week in child care  An estimated 14 percent of licensed child care centers nationwide are contaminated with hazardous levels of lead based paint  according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development   A recent report by the U S  Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified significant  systemic problems with the way in which the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  monitors and regulates the levels of lead in our nation s drinking water including a complete lack of reliable data on which to make assessments and decisions  The GAO study found that few schools and child care facilities nationwide have tested their water for lead and no focal point exists at either the national or state level to collect and analyze test results   Few states have comprehensive programs to detect and remediate lead in drinking water at schools and child care facilities     In June  in response to the GAO report  Senators Obama and Clinton joined with Senators Jim Jeffords  Joe Lieberman  Frank Lautenberg and Barbara Boxer in sending a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson calling on the agency to come clean on its methods for testing nationwide lead levels in drinking water and to immediate implement the GAO report s recommendations  including updating EPA s 1994 guidance on lead in drinking water in schools and non residential buildings

332,   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Continuing Crisis in Darfur   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                  Washington D C  Office SDB 40B Dirksen Senate Office Building   temporary location until April 19th                                                         Statement of Senator Barack Obama on the Continuing Crisis in Darfur Wednesday  April 23  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today released the following statement on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the continuing crisis in Darfur   All the proclamations  the  Never Again  speeches  and the efforts of many around the world have as yet failed to stop the five year long genocide in Darfur   The indiscriminate killing  raping and displacement continue and are escalating  Only decisive and concerted action can end this genocide    To start  the US must lead in supporting the full and effective deployment of the United Nations  UN  African Union  AU  protection force and ensure that the Government of Sudan faces meaningful penalties for obstructing and delaying the deployment of this force   Ambassador Williamson should be commended for his efforts to support the rapid deployment of the African Union United Nations operations in Darfur  UNAMID  peacekeepers   But the Administration  led by President Bush and Secretary Rice  must do more to ensure the UN has the necessary equipment    especially helicopter support    to ensure the full mobility and effectiveness of UNAMID troops  The US should also press for the unrestricted deployment of United Nations Mission in Sudan  UNMIS  forces in South Sudan to Abyei to help prevent the resumption of fighting in that fragile region where tensions are rising   I am deeply concerned by recent reports that the Bush Administration is negotiating the normalization of relations and lifting of sanctions against the Government of Sudan in exchange for piecemeal and modest action on a narrow set of issues   The approach contradicts the resolute and clear policy required to improve conditions on the ground for those at risk  Khartoum has a long history of breaking its commitments to its own people and to the international community   There should be no reward for bad faith   The US relationship with the Government of Sudan can only improve once conditions for the Sudanese people improve   I hope that this hearing will provide a clear explanation of how the Administration s current strategy adheres to this common sense principle     Those that continue to commit war crimes and obstruct peace and protection efforts must face significant penalties  The US should lead in the UN Security Council to impose effective targeted sanctions and to curtail violations of the arms embargo through the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee and the US Department of Treasury s Office of Foreign Assets Control   At the same time  the Administration should urge the AU to rebuke Khartoum for its role in the attempted coup in Chad  The US also needs to work with the International Criminal Court to ramp up the pace of indictments of those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity  while Khartoum must feel increased pressure to hand over those individuals already indicted by the Court    Lasting peace in Darfur and South Sudan can only be achieved through the unflagging commitment and cooperation of our government  other interested governments around the world  the UN  the AU  the Arab League  and the EU  among others  and advocacy groups  A more comprehensive  consistent  and robust diplomatic effort is an important part of the way forward   US leadership is urgently needed both to help construct a credible peace process for Darfur and to ensure the full and fair implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement  The US must work to ensure that a single mediator  actively supported by countries with significant leverage  emerges from the confusion that has characterized the Darfur peace process to date  Prime Minister Gordon Brown s offer to kick start the process is helpful and should be explored   At the same time  Special Envoy Williamson should have sufficient staff and support to devote sustained attention to both the genocide in Darfur and the fraying North South peace process   I am heartened that citizen pressure and activism all over the US is having an impact  Divestment campaigns focused on schools  states  and mutual funds are gathering momentum   Well targeted advocacy related to China s role in Sudan can help promote a more constructive attitude in Beijing   Activists    particularly religious groups    are helping to put the issue of the North South peace deal back on the radar screen  And the anti genocide movement is growing by the day   It is long past time for the US to exert effective leadership to end the first genocide of the 21st century and work to ensure that it is the last                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions

816,March 11  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Settlement of the Holocaust Survivors  Gold Train Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I am so pleased by the news that the Justice Department has finally settled the case of the Hungarian Gold Train brought by Hungarian Holocaust survivors  achieving the resolution deserved by thousands of survivors  Over the course of the last year I have urged the Administration to act on this pressing issue  including a letter I sent last May with Senator Arlen Specter and 15 additional Senators to Attorney General Ashcroft calling for immediate action  we have tried to achieve the resolution deserved by the survivors who were literally dying as their case languished  While nothing can heal the wounds suffered by many of these survivors  I am grateful and relieved that our government is providing long overdue redress to these aging men and women         For the past year  Senator Clinton has worked hard to push for a resolution in the Gold Train case  In March of 2004  Senator Clinton wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft to ask for immediate action on the  Gold Train  case  amid reports that officials at the United States Department of Justice were  dragging their feet  on resolving the matter  In May  Senator Clinton joined with Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA   and several of her Senate colleagues in a bipartisan letter calling on the Attorney General to solve the matter with survivors  In October  Senator Clinton issued a statement before the Senate urging the Justice Department to end  half a century of silence and cover up  and provide these survivors with the adequate compensation they deserve        In May of 1945  a train laden with valuables that had been seized from Hungarian Jews by the Nazis was turned over to US forces  Unfortunately  the United States maintained that the origin of the valuables was  unidentifiable  and the train s contents were never returned to their owners  According to the U S  Commission on Holocaust Assets  the Gold Train was an  egregious failure  of the United States to follow its own policy regarding restitution of property after World War II  Over a thousand New Yorkers and other Americans who faced Nazi cruelty and fled oppressive forces during or after World War II were waiting for justice for the mishandling of their property from the so called  gold train           ,0
554,   Remarks of Senator Barack Obama on the Confirmation of Judge John Roberts   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Remarks of Senator Barack Obama on the Confirmation of Judge John Roberts Thursday  September 22  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 22  2005 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama on the Confirmation of Judge John Roberts   First of all  let me congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for moving the process of confirming the nomination of Judge Roberts along with such civility  a civility that I believe speaks well of the Senate   Let me also say that I remain distressed that the White House during this confirmation process  which overall went smoothly  failed to provide critical documents as part of the record that could have provided us with a better basis to make our judgment with respect to the nomination   This White House continues to stymie efforts on the part of the Senate to do its job   I hope with the next nominee who comes up for the Supreme Court that the White House recognizes that in fact it is its duty not just to the Senate but to the American people to make sure we can thoroughly and adequately evaluate the record of every single nominee who comes before us   Having said that  the decision with respect to Judge Roberts  nomination has not been an easy one for me to make   As some of you know  I have not only argued cases before appellate courts but for 10 years was a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty and taught courses in constitutional law   Part of the culture of the University of Chicago Law School faculty is to maintain a sense of collegiality between those people who hold different views   What engenders respect is not the particular outcome that a legal scholar arrives at but  rather  the intellectual rigor and honesty with which he or she arrives at a decision    Given that background  I am sorely tempted to vote for Judge Roberts based on my study of his resume  his conduct during the hearings  and a conversation I had with him yesterday afternoon  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is qualified to sit on the highest court in the land   Moreover  he seems to have the comportment and the temperament that makes for a good judge   He is humble  he is personally decent  and he appears to be respectful of different points of view   It is absolutely clear to me that Judge Roberts truly loves the law   He couldn t have achieved his excellent record as an advocate before the Supreme Court without that passion for the law  and it became apparent to me in our conversation that he does  in fact  deeply respect the basic precepts that go into deciding 95 percent of the cases that come before the Federal court    adherence to precedence  a certain modesty in reading statutes and constitutional text  a respect for procedural regularity  and an impartiality in presiding over the adversarial system   All of these characteristics make me want to vote for Judge Roberts    The problem I face    a problem that has been voiced by some of my other colleagues  both those who are voting for Mr  Roberts and those who are voting against Mr  Roberts    is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court  so that both a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 percent of the cases    what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult   In those cases  adherence to precedent and rules of construction and interpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon   That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one s deepest values  one s core concerns  one s broader perspectives on how the world works  and the depth and breadth of one s empathy   In those 5 percent of hard cases  the constitutional text will not be directly on point   The language of the statute will not be perfectly clear   Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision   In those circumstances  your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this country or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their reproductive decisions or whether the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce  whether a person who is disabled has the right to be accommodated so they can work alongside those who are nondisabled    in those difficult cases  the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge s heart   I talked to Judge Roberts about this   Judge Roberts confessed that  unlike maybe professional politicians  it is not easy for him to talk about his values and his deeper feelings   That is not how he is trained   He did say he doesn t like bullies and has always viewed the law as a way of evening out the playing field between the strong and the weak    I was impressed with that statement because I view the law in much the same way   The problem I had is that when I examined Judge Roberts  record and history of public service  it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak   In his work in the White House and the Solicitor General s Office  he seemed to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our political process  In these same positions  he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather than a man    I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he doesn t like bullies and he sees the law and the Court as a means of evening the playing field between the strong and the weak   But given the gravity of the position to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the decisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during his tenure on the Court  I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the overarching political philosophy that he appears to have shared with those in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our meeting    The bottom line is this   I will be voting against John Roberts  nomination   I do so with considerable reticence   I hope that I am wrong   I hope that this reticence on my part proves unjustified and that Judge Roberts will show himself to not only be an outstanding legal thinker but also someone who upholds the Court s historic role as a check on the majoritarian impulses of the executive branch and the legislative branch   I hope that he will recognize who the weak are and who the strong are in our society   I hope that his jurisprudence is one that stands up to the bullies of all ideological stripes  Let me conclude with just one more comment about this confirmation process     I was deeply disturbed by some statements that were made by largely Democratic advocacy groups when ranking member Senator Leahy announced that he would support Judge Roberts   Although the scales have tipped in a different direction for me  I am deeply admiring of the work and the thought that Senator Leahy has put into making his decision   The knee jerk unbending and what I consider to be unfair attacks on Senator Leahy s motives were unjustified   Unfortunately  both parties have fallen victim to this kind of pressure   I believe every Senator on the other side of the aisle  if they were honest  would acknowledge that the same unyielding  unbending  dogmatic approach to judicial confirmation has in large part been responsible for the kind of poisonous atmosphere that exists in this Chamber regarding judicial nominations   It is tempting  then  for us on this side of the aisle to go tit for tat    But what I would like to see is for all of us to recognize as we move forward to the next nominee that in fact the issues that are confronted by the Supreme Court are difficult issues   That is why they get up to the Supreme Court   The issues facing the Court are rarely black and white  and all advocacy groups who have a legitimate and profound interest in the decisions that are made by the Court should try to make certain that their advocacy reflects that complexity   These groups on the right and left should not resort to the sort of broad brush dogmatic attacks that have hampered the process in the past and constrained each and every Senator in this Chamber from making sure that they are voting on the basis of their conscience    Thank you very much                                      ,1

Hope Foundation                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced final Congressional approval of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill  which includes funding for projects in Western New York such as improvements at Niagara Falls International Airport and Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station  and increased research at the Hunter James Kelly Research Institutes Kelly Center  The omnibus bill  having passed both houses of Congress will now go to the President to be signed into law    These projects are crucial to fueling economic growth across Western New York and for giving local residents top notch services in education  law enforcement and health care  said Senator Schumer  By investing in these vital projects  we ensure that Western New York continues to lure new businesses and tourists to the region  while ensuring families have the first class services they need    These are important investments for the future of Western New York  said Senator Clinton  I especially welcome funding for Niagara Falls International Airport  as well as for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station located there  The proposed expansion at the airport will allow more extensive cargo operations and spur even more economic activity in Western New York  The improvements at the Air Reserve Station will further enhance its role in our national defense   I am also proud to announce funding to support potentially life saving research on genetic disorders at the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute    Federal funds will be used at the Niagara Falls International Airport to build a new terminal apron and for road improvements   The new apron will be large enough for two B 747 aircrafts to park alongside the cargo facilities and simultaneously operate   Adding 53 850 square feet of asphalt pavement  and 29 500 square feet of concrete in phase 1B will alleviate any operating constraints related to simultaneous operations of multiple aircraft  Filling in the 162 000 square feet of pavement from Phase 1A  will prevent the cargo operators from having to tug the planes to the cargo hanger in order to comply with FAA clearance and operating regulations   This construction will meet the needs of planned cargo operations  accommodate the various types of aircraft that would use the facility  and be a significant step in integrating the airport into the economic development infrastructure of the greater Niagara area    The funds for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station will help construct new facilities on the base  which will include administrative and organizational buildings designed to house headquarters  classrooms  arms rooms  logistics supply rooms  motor pools  and maintenance bays  When these facilities are completed  units will have modern and revitalized facilities from which to support their missions  There are approximately 100 AFRC units being built nation wide to support the BRAC consolidation plan  The funding approved for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station marks the continuation of Senator Schumer and Clintons commitment to keeping the facility running to its full potential and to further ensuring the stations future    The federal funding for Hunters Hope Foundation will establish the technology infrastructure of the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute inside the University at Buffalos Center for Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences  The Institute will coordinate research initiatives into finding a cure for Krabbe disease and related genetic disorders  One in 100 000 live births in the United States are afflicted with Krabbe Disease  Approximately 2 million people  or one out of 125  in the United States are carriers of the genetic deficiency that causes Krabbe Disease  The Hunters Hope Foundation was established in 1997 by Pro Football Hall of Fame member and former Buffalo Bills Quarterback Jim Kelly and his wife  Jill  after their infant son  Hunter  was diagnosed with Krabbe Leukodystrophy  an inherited  fatal  nervous system disease  The Foundation is the Kellys life long commitment to increase public awareness of leukodystrophies as well as to increase the likelihood of early detection and treatment  Their ultimate goal is to raise money to fund research efforts to identify new treatments  therapies  and a cure for Krabbe and other leukodystrophies    The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes funding for the following projects for Western New York         ,0

1920,"ECONOMIC STIMULUS GET IT RIGHT
  There was more disappointing economic news on Thursday. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending edged up just two-tenths of a percent in December, much less than the month before. A Labor Department report said the number of people applying for unemployment compensation rose sharply. On Capitol Hill, Congress continued to cobble together a stimulus package. On the floor of the Senate and in behind-the-scenes negotiations, Senator Bernie Sanders pressed for passage of stronger measures than the House had hurriedly approved on Tuesday. He urged senators to increase help for senior citizens and veterans, and he said he would fight for substantial relief for people struggling to pay skyrocketing home heating bills. ""We have serious economic problems,"" Sanders said. ""Let's pass an economic stimulus package quickly, but let's make sure we get it right."" 
   The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday recommended significant improvements to the House version of the bill, especially for seniors and veterans. ""Low-income senior citizens across this country are facing very serious economic problems and, like low- and middle-income working people, they also need help,"" Sanders said. ""That is why I strongly support the provision which will enable over 20 million senior citizens to get a $500 rebate.""
   Sanders also applauded the Senate committee version of the bill for providing a rebate to about 250,000 veterans who receive disability compensation and for extending unemployment benefits for 13 extra weeks in all states and for 26 weeks in states experiencing severe joblessness.
   Still, Sanders said, the Senate should do more.
   He is fighting to expand the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. ""Without increased home heating help, senior citizens on fixed incomes, persons with disabilities, and low-income families with children are in danger of going cold in Vermont and throughout the country. We must not let that happen. LIHEAP must be a part of this package.""
   During the last economic slowdown in 2001, Sanders was the first person in Congress to propose income tax rebates as a way to stimulate the economy, an idea that at the time was scoffed at by leading congressional conservatives. Now, he said, rebates are an important part of the current stimulus package, but investments that create good-paying jobs also are needed.
   ""Giving someone $500 or $600 alone will not fix the economic situations facing millions of Americans,"" Sanders said. ""Putting Americans to work at decent-paying jobs and helping those most in need could do much more to strengthen the middle class and reduce the poverty rate.""

1912,"SEN. SANDERS TO SECRETARY RICE: ESCALATE DIPLOMACY NOT TROOPS IN IRAQ
  Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-VT) today met with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and called on the Administration to escalate diplomatic efforts, rather than the number of troops, in order to end the quagmire in Iraq. In his remarks, Sanders also urged the Administration to abandon its unilateral approach to the war by working in a true bipartisan manner and by charting a new course in Iraq in consultation with the Congress. 
   Sanders said, ""Now is the time to increase the level of diplomacy, not the level of American troops put into harms way in the middle of a civil war. We need bipartisan diplomatic solutions in order to bring stability to the region and bring our troops home as soon as possible.""  
   Sanders today became the first cosponsor of S. Res. 39, a resolution offered by Senator Robert Byrd, which declares the need for the Administration to seek approval before instigating offensive military action against another nation. He is also a cosponsor of S. 233, which prevents the President from escalating the war and increasing the troop numbers in Iraq without the express consent of Congress. Following the State Department meeting, Senator Sanders forwarded a letter to Secretary Rice reiterating the strong concerns he raised in their meeting. A copy of Senator Sanders' letter to Secretary Rice is below. 
   January 30, 2007 
   The Honorable Condoleezza Rice 
  Secretary of State 
  United States Department of State 
  2201 C Street, NW 
  Washington, D.C. 20520 
   Dear Secretary Rice: 
   Thank you for meeting with the newly-elected members of the United States Senate today to discuss important foreign policy issues and your plans to work with the Senate for a strong, bipartisan approach to national security affairs. 
   Let me begin by saying that my understanding of ""bipartisan"" is that it means that both sides - executive and legislative, as well as Republican and Democratic/Independent - have a shared role in shaping America's relation to the world. Please don't talk about ""bipartisanship"" when, in fact, the Bush Administration has been steadfast in ignoring the Democrat and Independent Members of Congress, and their foreign policy concerns. In recent months, President Bush has shown that he is prepared to circumvent the wishes of Congress by committing us to an escalation of the war in Iraq. 
   Second, let me voice my hope that instead of going forward with an ill-conceived escalation of troop forces in Iraq - an escalation which comes on the heels of previous escalations, all of which have been unsuccessful - President Bush will go forward instead with an escalation of diplomacy in the region. No less an authority than the Iraq Study Group - itself bipartisan, itself first proposed by Republican Rep. Frank Wolf, itself funded by the Republican Congress, itself consisting of a former Republican and a former Democratic Secretary of State, as well as a Republican Attorney General and Democratic White House Chief of Staff, as well as a former Republican and a former Democratic Senator, and a former Chair of the House International Relations Committee - set forward the idea that all parties in the region, including Syria and Iran, should be brought to the negotiating table. Now is the time to increase the level of diplomacy, not the level of American troops put into harm's way in the middle of a civil war. 
   Third, and perhaps most important, let me tell you how I read the Constitution of the United States. The wording of Article 1, Section 8 is explicit: ""The Congress shall have the power . . . to declare war."" The Congress declares war, not the President. The President certainly plays a central role in foreign policy, but the Congress also has Constitutional authority in this area. That means if the Bush administration provokes a war against Iran, as it is currently threatening to do, we will have a Constitutional crisis of the gravest severity. If the President ignores the Constitutionally-defined and mandated Congressional role in making war, there will be very dire consequences for this administration. 
   I look forward to working together with you in a bipartisan manner. But that can only happen if it is in fact bipartisan, if it prizes diplomacy rather than solely depending on military force, and if the President accepts the Constitutional role given to the Congress as the sole body empowered to declare war. 
   Sincerely yours, 
   Bernard Sanders 
  United States Senator

1776,"SEN. SANDERS: NO MORE BAD TRADE DEALS
  There are a whole lot of absurd discussions that take place in the Congress. That's nothing new to the American people. But at the top of the list for absurd discussions is our trade policy. 
   Year after year after year, what we are doing in trade is failing in terms of our trade deficits, which are going up and up and up. The policy is failing in terms of the number of good-paying, blue-collar manufacturing jobs we continue to lose. Trade policy is failing because we're at the cusp of losing millions of good-paying, white-collar information-technology jobs.
   The most important question, in my view, that Congress can deal with - should be dealing with - is why is it that, with an explosion of technology and a huge increase in worker productivity, there are millions and millions of American workers today who have seen a decline in their standard of living and in their real wages, and in the last five years, 5 million more Americans have become poor?
   Globalization and our trade policies are not the only reason for that, but are an important part of that equation. The simple reality is that what these trade policies are about - and have been forced upon us by large multinational corporations - they are asking American workers to compete against desperate people in the developing world, who in some cases make pennies an hour.
   That is what our trade policy is about.
   And if you are a large corporate leader, it doesn't take a Ph.D. in economics to understand that, yes, you will throw American workers out on the street, who make $20 an hour, have health care, and where you have to obey environmental regulations. And yes, you'll run to China, pay people 30 cents an hour. If they stand up for a union, they go to jail. If they stand up for environmental regulations, they go to jail. Why wouldn't you go to China?
   And of course, that's exactly what many, many American corporations are doing.
   One of the changes, in terms of trade policy, that has taken place in recent years is that, years ago, people really, at the heads of these corporations, didn't admit, didn't acknowledge what they are doing.
   But right now, we're seeing people very proudly saying what they are doing. Jeffrey Immelt, the head of GE has said, ""When I'm talking to G.E. managers, I talk about China, China, China.""
   With pride, they talk about how they're going to throw American workers out on the street and move to China. Other major CEOs do the same.
   So, bottom line is, when you have a football coach who, year after year, gives you a losing record, what most organizations do is say, ""Thank you; we're getting rid of the coach; we're changing our policy.""
   This is a failed strategy. Seeing the middle class of America decline is a failed strategy. Seeing jobs go to China that used to be in this country paying people a living wage, is a failed strategy.
   The time is now, to completely reassess our trade policies and develop a trade program which works for American workers and the middle class and not just for the CEOs of large multinational corporations.

5,   Statement of Senator Barack Obama on International Human Rights Day   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Statement of Senator Barack Obama on International Human Rights Day Monday  December 10  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 WASHINGTON  DC    The following statement was submitted by U  S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  in the Congressional Record today on International Human Rights Day      Mr  President  today is Human Rights Day  Fifty nine years ago today  thanks in large measure to the tireless leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt  the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      The principles encompassed in the Declaration are uniquely rooted in the American tradition  beginning with our founding documents  Yet the Declaration also wove together a remarkable variety of political  religious  and cultural perspectives and traditions  The United States and the United Kingdom championed civil liberties  The French representative on the committee helped devise the structure of the Declaration  India added the prohibition on discrimination  China stressed the importance of family and reminded UN delegates that every right carried with it companion duties  Today should be a day of celebration  a day when we hail the universality of these core principles  which are both beacons to guide us and the foundations for building a more just and stable world        The Universal Declaration was a radical document in its time  and its passage required courageous leadership from political leaders  Even though no country could have been said to be in full compliance with its provisions  including the United States where Jim Crow still prevailed  all UN member states committed themselves to promoting  protecting  and respecting fundamental human rights  Although Franklin Delano Roosevelt did not live to see the enactment of the historic Declaration  it enshrined his    four freedoms       freedom from want  freedom of speech  freedom of religion  and freedom from fear  Individuals in the United States and everywhere else were entitled  simply by virtue of being human  to physical and economic security  The Declaration was born of the recognition  in the words of one human rights scholar  that    what is pain and humiliation for you is pain and humiliation for me           Anniversaries are a good time to examine how faithful we have been to our own aspirations     to ask ourselves how well we are measuring up  to assess whether our practice lives up to our promise  We in the United States enjoy tremendous freedoms  but we also carry a special responsibility     the responsibility of being the country so many people in the world look to  just as they did in Mrs  Roosevelt   s day  for human rights leadership        Today  on this anniversary  we must acknowledge both bad news and good news  The bad news is that for nearly seven years  President Bush has ignored Franklin Roosevelt s wise counsel about the corrosive effects of fear  Indeed  instead of urging us to reject fear  he has stoked false fear and undermined our values        Wounded by a horrific terrorist attack  we were warned that Saddam Hussein     a man who had nothing to do with that attack     could unleash mushroom clouds from nuclear bombs  We were told that waterboarding was effective  We were assured that shipping men off to countries that tortured was good for national security  We were led to believe that our military and civilian courts were inadequate  and so we established a network of unaccountable prisons  And the Administration launched secret wiretapping initiatives  scoffed at the rule of law  and flaunted the will of the Congress          Nonetheless  in his second inaugural  President Bush rightly proclaimed     America s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one     But  tragically  he has failed to heed his own words   We have not only vacated the perch of moral leader  we have also compounded the threat we face  spurring more people to take up arms against us       The further bad news is that other countries have not stepped up to fill the void left by our lack of moral leadership  The hundreds of thousands killed and two million displaced by the genocide in Darfur  the shell shocked Buddhist monks in Burma  the political opposition in Zimbabwe  the imprisoned independent journalists in Russia  the brave human rights lawyers and judges in Pakistan     they do not know where to turn internationally  Human rights abusers win seats on the UN Human Rights Council  the International Criminal Court issues war crimes indictments  but no country steps up to enforce them  the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations begs in vain for troops  helicopters and police to help stave off humanitarian catastrophes  For all these reasons  the world needs renewed  principled U S  leadership       There is another critical reason why America must again provide moral leadership on human rights  the fate of women around the world  Whether it is in creating wealth  access to capital  and property rights  or receiving quality education  health care  and social services  women still lag far behind men   And of course the lack of full reproductive rights can be a matter of life and death for too many women  Inequality means insecurity for women  especially those who comprise 70 percent of the world   s poorest  There is a clear link between discrimination and violence against women  equality and empowerment of women is the most effective approach to ending violence against women  Today  violent acts against women  in the words of UNICEF     are the most pervasive violation of human rights in the world today           Women   s inequality and the persistent prevalence of honor killings  trafficking  repression  and sexual assault nearly six decades after the Universal Declaration shame us all  One need only look to Saudi Arabia  where a 19 year old woman  who was raped  instead of receiving treatment and support  was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for riding in a car with a non related male   In the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Darfur  rape is routinely used as a weapon of war by militia and government forces   In northern Uganda  young girls are given as    prizes    to older male soldiers to reward performance        In Pakistan  international observers report that one of the largest challenges facing its next election is guaranteeing women enough security so they can leave their homes to vote  In Iraq the militarization and rise of radical Islam has eroded women   s rights  In Afghanistan  while nothing can compare to the day when the Taliban ruled the entire country  women throughout that country complain that their freedoms have been woefully curtailed  The United States alone cannot solve the problem of women s suffering and gender inequality around the world  but with new  principled leadership  the United States can elevate women s economic  political and social development to the top of our international agenda and ensure that women around the world know that they have a reliable friend and partner in America      Let me close by saying that the very depth of the anti Americanism felt around the world today is a testament not to hatred but to disappointment  acute disappointment  The global public expects more from America  They expect our government to embody what they have seen in our people  industriousness  humanity  generosity  and a commitment to equality  We can become that country again                                   Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be

1007,June 13  2006 Senator Clinton Challenges Members of Congress to Put their Support for Contraception on the Record                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Calls for Senators and Representatives to Support Congressional Resolution to Strengthen Family Planning Services for Women Click here to read the full text of Senator Clinton s remarks    Washington  DC    In receiving the Outstanding Public Service Award from the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  issued a challenge to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to go on record supporting family planning for all women   Senator Clinton emphasized that too often those who say they support preventing unwanted pregnancies have flip flopped when it comes time to vote in support of contraception and family planning  hiding behind cost as the reason   Senator Clinton and Representative Nita Lowey  D NY  have introduced a resolution in both Houses of Congress that does not cost a penny and allows members of Congress to declare their public support for programs and policies that make it easier for all women at all income levels to obtain contraceptives and use them consistently and correctly over time            Educating and supporting women so that they can prevent unintended pregnancies in the first place is one of the most important investments we can make   I am calling on my colleagues in Congress  Republicans and Democrats  to join me in ensuring all women have the family planning services they need  so that together we can help to decrease the number of unintended pregnancies     said Senator Clinton           The United States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies in the industrialized world   Half of the six million pregnancies in America are unintended  and nearly half of those end in abortion every year   Many of these pregnancies can be prevented if we remove barriers preventing women from affordable contraception           Recently  the non partisan Guttmacher Institute released a major report revealing the tragic two tiered system that is steadily emerging in our country  High income women have quick  convenient access to contraceptives  while low income women do not and as a result more often become pregnant unintentionally   In fact  a poor woman is four times as likely to experience an unplanned pregnancy as a higher income woman          Senator Clinton has been a tireless champion of expanding access to women  s health care  ensuring all women have access to contraception and reducing unintended pregnancies   As First Lady  Senator Clinton helped create the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy  which has helped reduce the teen birth rate by nearly a third since the early 1990s   She also worked to prevent restrictions on access to Title X family planning services from becoming law and helped lead the Clinton Administration  s successful effort to increase Title X funding            She has continued this leadership and advocacy in the Senate   Senator Clinton is the original sponsor along with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of the Prevention First Act  a comprehensive bill aimed at reducing unintended pregnancies  preventing abortions and improving women s health   Senator Clinton has also introduced the Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act to ensure that Medicaid coverage for family planning services remains accessible to low income women and that states extend coverage for family planning services and supplies to women who would be entitled to Medicaid funded prenatal  labor  delivery and postpartum care          ,0

                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Nation s Highest Military Honor to be Awarded to Patchogue Native Who Sacrificed his Life During Combat Mission in Afghanistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Tim Bishop today welcomed the news that Long Island native  Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy  who was killed in action on June 28  2005 while serving in Afghanistan  OPERATION Enduring Freedom  will be posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism in combat  Lieutenant Murphy  age 29  a U S  Navy SEAL  was killed in action while serving as part of a reconnaissance mission in Afghanistan  The award was approved by the President on September 7  and the Medal of Honor will be presented to Lt  Murphys parents at a White House ceremony on October 22     A native son of Long Island and a true hero in every sense of the word  Lt  Michael Murphys life is a testament to honor on and off the battlefield  said Senator Clinton  Without regard for his own safety  Michael exposed himself to enemy fire in an attempt to save the lives of his fellow team members who were greatly outnumbered by a determined and vicious enemy  This epitomizes the integrity and dedication that those who have known Lt  Murphy had come to expect from the young man who grew up in Patchogue  New York  Lt  Murphys acts of heroism can never be fully repaid  but it is my hope that the Medal of Honor will serve to honor his memory and ensure that the selfless sacrifice he made that day will not be forgotten    Lt  Michael Murphy s legacy has reached far beyond the shores of Long Island  said Congressman Bishop  His sacrifice reminds us of the dangers the men and women of our Armed Forces face in order to defend our nation  I can think of no one more deserving of this medal today  It can never make up for his loss  but it extends the honor which he and his family so well deserve    Lieutenant Murphy was killed during a reconnaissance mission  in support of OPERATION Red Wings  Kunar Province  Afghanistan in search of Taliban and al Qaeda insurgents  Lieutenant Murphys four man Navy SEAL team was dropped off in a heavily forested area along steep terrain in the country s eastern mountain border with Pakistan  During the mission  the groups position was compromised  and shortly afterwards came under attack from a large insurgent force      Reports have stated that Lt  Murphy  in an attempt to establish radio contact for assistance  abandoned his secure position and exposed himself to the enemies withering gunfire  Although immediately wounded while making the call  he returned to his position and continued fighting where he saved the life of one of his fellow SEALs  Of the four man SEAL group  Murphy and two others were killed  The lone survivor was the SEAL whose life was saved by Lt  Murphy     At Patchogue Medford High School on Long Island  Michael Murphy was a National Honor Society student and a varsity football athlete  He worked as a lifeguard during his summer vacations  He attended Penn State University  majoring in political science and excelling academically     Michael decided shortly after graduating from college that he would fulfill his passion to become a Navy SEAL  He served with distinction and was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart in recognition of his courage and sacrifice    He is survived by his mother Maureen Murphy  his father Dan Murphy  his brother John Murphy  and his fiance Heather Duggan   In 2006  Clinton and Bishop sought to honor Lt  Murphy by having the U S  Post Office in Patchogue renamed as the Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy Post Office Building  The legislation was originally introduced in the House of Representatives by Bishop  where it was passed unanimously  It was then introduced by Clinton in the Senate  where it passed  and was later signed into law by the President on August 2  2006    Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy is the first recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in combat in Afghanistan in support of OPERATION Enduring Freedom and the first Congressional Medal of Honor awarded to a Sailor since the Vietnam War   There have been two other Congressional Medal of Honor recipients since the attacks of September 11  2001  both for actions in support of OPERATION Iraqi Freedom      Congress made the Medal of Honor a permanent decoration in 1863 and it is the highest honor bestowed upon American soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines  It is awarded by the President  in the name of Congress  to a person who distinguishes himself or herself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in action against an enemy of the United States  while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force  or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party  The deed performed must have been one of personal bravery or self sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life  Incontestable proof of the performance of the service will be exacted and each recommendation for the award of this decoration will be considered on the standard of extraordinary merit         ,0
964,December 13  2005 Clinton  Nadler Call For GAO Investigation Into EPA Post 9 11 Lower Manhattan Clean Up Efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Jerrold Nadler today reiterated their call for the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to undertake an investigation into the EPA s failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan for testing and cleaning indoor air contamination following the September 11th attacks         In a letter sent today to the GAO  Clinton and Nadler expressed their   serious concerns that EPA s response to September 11th has not adequately protected public health and environment     saying that   more than four years after the attacks of September 11  2001  EPA s work to address the environmental health consequences of those attacks remains unfinished   We hoped that the Panel process would lead to answers for New Yorkers  but instead it has raised new questions that we believe that the GAO should investigate with urgency           At a press conference last week  Clinton and Nadler joined with residents  workers and community advocates in calling on the EPA to revise its plan and announced that they would ask the U S  General Accountability Office to investigate the EPA s failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan in response to the post 9 11 environmental disaster        Twenty months ago  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  began working in conjunction with the World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel  WTC Panel  as well as community and labor representatives to develop a plan to determine the extent of remaining indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center   Substantial progress was made  but in recent months  development of the plan drifted   During 2005  only two WTC Panel meetings were held since February  and the last meeting took place more than four months ago in July          On November 29th  the EPA   ignoring input from its own panel members  residents  workers and the community   announced their plan to test and clean indoor air spaces following the collapse of the World Trade Center  Fundamentally  the plan fails to correct the major problems identified by EPA  s Inspector General in 2003   For example  the plan does not include testing north of Canal Street or in Brooklyn  in spite of the Inspector General  s conclusion that the cleanup boundaries were not scientifically developed   In addition  the plan ignores many of the recommendations made by the World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel over the last 20 months        In addition to the GAO report  Clinton and Nadler are also calling on the EPA to put forward a revised plan incorporating a number of key principles that were not included in the EPA s final plan  These principles include but are not limited to           The plan should include residential  commercial  and work places in expanded geographic areas  including north of Canal Street and Brooklyn  which has been supported by EPA in previous drafts           The plan should offer clean up for exceedances of benchmarks that have been developed for Contaminants of Potential Concern  COPC  as an incentive for participation in the program          The plan should provide for the continued development of a viable WTC signature  taking into consideration the recommendations of the peer reviewers without using the signature as a basis for clean up        The text of their letter follows        December 13  2005       The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C   20548       Dear Mr  Walker        We are writing to respectfully request that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  immediately conduct an investigation into the Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan in response to the environmental contamination resulting from the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001 in New York        In August 2003  the EPA Inspector General  IG  released a report entitled  EPA s Response to the World Trade Center Collapse  Challenges  Successes and Areas for Improvement    This IG Report was very critical of the response by EPA and the White House Council of Environmental Quality  CEQ  to the terrorist attack on New York City   The report made a number of recommendations to EPA  including how to correct flaws in the indoor cleanup program conducted by EPA in 2002 2003        At the urging of Senator Clinton  the EPA and CEQ agreed to establish an independent panel to reexamine some of the problems identified by the IG   This  World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel   chaired by EPA and consisting of scientific experts as well as representatives from the community and labor groups  met regularly over a period of twenty months   During those meetings  the Panel made recommendations to the Agency about how to design a more scientifically sound testing and cleanup plan for indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center   On November 29  2005 the EPA released a final plan  which ignores many of the recommendations of the Panel  and instead would initiate a limited testing and cleanup program very similar to the 2002 2003 program that had been criticized by the IG   In addition  EPA announced its intention to prematurely dismantle the Panel          The final EPA cleanup plan has serious flaws  and disregards recommendations of both the EPA IG and the Panel   In the plan  EPA abandoned commitments it had made to the Panel and the community to test in businesses and workspaces  and to test in expanded geographic areas exposed to World Trade Center debris  such as Brooklyn   In addition  the EPA plan stops any further work on developing a signature or other means of identifying World Trade Center dust  ignores  reservoirs  of contamination  and fails to adequately address building HVAC systems        We have serious concerns that EPA s response to September 11th has not adequately protected public health and environment   Unfortunately  EPA s recent decision to dismantle the panel and initiate a flawed testing and clean up program repeats a familiar pattern in which the Agency has sought to downplay the potential risks and convey false assurances regarding World Trade Center contamination  rather than developing a scientifically sound approach to assessing and reducing these risks        Therefore  we respectfully request that the GAO initiate an investigation to answer the following questions        1  Has the Agency implemented the recommendations of the August  2003 IG report   If not  why not        2  Which issues raised by the IG did the Panel consider  and what did the Panel recommend to address these issues        3  Which recommendations made by the Panel and or the community groups has the EPA adopted in its plan  and what is EPA s rationale for adopting or rejecting these recommendations        4  The EPA IG found that the White House interfered with EPA s statements about air quality in the days following September 11  2001   Is there evidence of any similar interference by Administration officials in the Panel process or the development of the current plan   Did Administration officials inject political considerations ahead of science or the recommendations of the Panel in the development of the plan        5  How was it determined that  7 million was an appropriate amount for this testing and clean up program  and where did the figure originate        More than four years after the attacks of September 11  2001  EPA s work to address the environmental health consequences of those attacks remains unfinished   We hoped that the Panel process would lead to answers for New Yorkers  but instead it has raised new questions that we believe that the GAO should investigate with urgency        If you need any additional information  please feel free to contact us   We stand ready to work with you to answer any questions you may have        Sincerely

System   1 million for the City of Poughkeepsie Transit Hub  and  400 000 for the Haverstraw Ferry Terminal The bill will now proceed to conference     This is great news for the Hudson Valley and another important hurdle in the appropriations process  Schumer said   The Newburgh project will revitalize and restore the Armory District  fueling the exciting economic development taking place in that wonderful Hudson River city   The new environmentally friendly bus fleet in Westchester puts that county at the cutting edge of environmentally sound mass transit  The improved ferry operations in Haverstraw supports a vital new transportation option for Rockland County commuters  And the new transit hub for Poughkeepsie will significantly improve commuting services for Dutchess County and the whole Hudson Valley    The Senates passage of this bill is another important step in securing funds for these projects in the Hudson Valley  These funds for the Revitalization Planning and Development of Newburghs Armory District will further assist with the redevelopment of their facilities  helping to improve the neighborhood both physically and economically  I am pleased that the funds for the Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will facilitate the construction of a centralized public transit center that will help to alleviate disruptive traffic congestion and promote public transportation that can reduce harmful green house gas emissions   Much needed support will be provided for the Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus System to replace out dated buses that will decrease emissions  and give residents a cleaner  greener ride  Senator Clinton said   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive funds to increase parking capacity  improve passenger waiting facilities  and increase access from Manhattan   which will greatly contribute to the economic growth of the area and relieve congestion    The City of Newburghs Armory District Revitalization Planning and Development program will receive  200 000 of federal funds to be used for planning and design efforts within the Citys Armory District   Implementation will include corridor planning utilizing the principles of urban design  the development of architectural designs  and mixed use commercial development planning   The support of this initiative via the Economic Development Initiative  EDI  will aid the redevelopment of this deteriorating corridor   Coordinating and planning the improvement for this corridor will help ensure economic vitality and neighborhood restoration  as well as support current and future private rehabilitation occurring in the corridor   Newburgh is located in Orange County    The Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus Systems Low Emission ADA Accessible Replacement Buses project will receive  1 million of federal funds to replaces buses to decrease emissions   Westchester County proposes the replacement of 114 over age buses in the County public transit fleet  30 of which are not ADA accessible   This money will fund busses ordered in 2006 through 2008  to be delivered in 2007 through 2009    The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive  400 000 of federal funds to upgrade the ferry service to Lower Manhattan   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal currently serves the Haverstraw Ossining ferry  and will serve the Haverstraw Yonkers Lower Manhattan ferry service in the near future   Currently  there are limited parking and waiting facilities available at the site for passengers   These funds will be used to make parking and landside improvements  such as a climate controlled facility large enough to accommodate up to 100 passengers   When it is time for the ferry to move to their future  permanent home  several years from now   the passenger waiting facility structure can be relocated    The City of Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will receive  1 million of federal funds to build a combination Public Transit Hub and Parking Deck in the central business district to serve as a hub for city  county and private bus riders and provide resident parking   The City of Poughkeepsie is in the planning stages for a Public Transit Hub to be located on a City owned surface parking lot in the central business district  The structure will serve two much needed purposes by providing parking to residents and visitors and by serving as a transportation hub for bus riders on city  county  and intercity privately operated bus services   This project combines transit and economic development components  The first floor of the facility will serve the bus systems and their riders  and the upper floors will provide public parking spaces in support of the City s revitalization and redevelopment of the Luckey  Platt Building  the center piece of Main Street redevelopment efforts and a National Historic Landmark  The 150 000 square foot building is currently being redeveloped by private owners as a mixed retail market rate residential project    The bus systems and their riders are in dire need of a convenient and suitable location for downtown riders to wait for a bus or to transfer to another bus  Currently  riders must assemble at an on street transfer point bus stop  The current location does not accommodate the number of buses that are at that location during peak times  and riders have to wait at the curb or in a limited number of bus shelters   Within the Hub  the ground floor of the facility will house the transit hub with covered spaces for passengers and buses to enter  wait  and exit  Bus service will be maintained at its current location  but the transfer point for all buses will become the Transit Hub  Shuttle bus service from the Transit Hub to the Metro North and Amtrak Station may be an option as the City redevelops  Buses from the City Bus system  the Dutchess County Loop bus system  and regional intercity bus services will use the facility   Now that the bill has been passed by the House and Senate individually  it will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature         ,0

1823,"SEN. SANDERS CONDEMNS BUSH ADMINISTRATION FOR IMPOSING EXECUTIVE ORDER RESTRICTING ACCESS TO POPULAR CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM
  The Bush administration has imposed an executive order restricting access to a popular children's health insurance program. The new rules will thwart efforts by Vermont and other states to expand health care and could leave some 2,000 Vermont children who are currently enrolled without coverage. What the Bush administration is doing, Senator Bernie Sanders said, is ""sick.""  
   ""It is outrageous that President Bush is slamming the doctors' office door on sick children,"" said Sanders, a member of the Senate health committee. 
   ""We are the only major nation which does not provide health insurance for all children. Instead of throwing kids off health care, Bush should be working with us to cover more kids,"" Sanders added. ""Frankly, even for the Bush administration this is a new low. While he pushes for billions in tax breaks for the richest 1 percent, he is throwing kids off of the health insurance they already have. What a set of priorities!"" 
   In a letter to state health officials, the Bush administration outlined new federal rules that limit access to the Children's Health Insurance Program. Sanders said the new eligibility restrictions could be especially devastating in Vermont. An estimated 2,000 of the 3,000 children enrolled in the Dr. Dynasaur program could lose coverage or the state would have to pay the entire amount for their insurance.
   According to Families USA, ""The Administrations new requirements will effectively establish a new income limit for SCHIP at 250 percent of poverty, Kathleen Stoll, Director of Health Policy for Families USA. Under current law, states can decide for themselves what the income limit for SCHIP should be. This new policy guts the ability of states to tailor their own SCHIP programs. Even worse, it eliminates health coverage for tens of thousands of children in at least 18 states and it blocks other states from enrolling additional uninsured children."" According to the State of New Jersey, ""'We are horrified at the new federal policy,' said Ann Clemency Kohler, deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey. 'It will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children.'"" [Families USA, 8/20/08, New York Times, 8/21/08]
   Cindy Mann, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, said the Bush administration ""would effectively foreclose the opportunity for states to cover children in families with incomes of about $40,000 to $50,000 a year, depending on the size of family."" [Washington Post, 8/21/07; New York Times, 8/21/07] 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid.

624,   Obama and Harkin Praise Compromise Energy Bill as Critical to Future of the Domestic Biofuels Industry and the Rural Economy   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama and Harkin Praise Compromise Energy Bill as Critical to Future of the Domestic Biofuels Industry and the Rural Economy Thursday  December  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                     CONTACT  Amy Brundage  OBAMA  or Kate Cyrul  HARKIN   Bill incorporates Obama Harkin proposals on RFS  Carbon Fuels Standard   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Harkin  D IA  praised the agreement on energy legislation reached by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as an important step toward diversifying the country   s energy supply and strengthening the economy of rural America   The legislation includes an immediate expansion of the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  to 36 billion gallons by 2022 and lays important groundwork for the future adoption of a national low carbon fuels standard  proposals that Obama and Harkin had jointly proposed previously as a means of reducing the country   s dependence on fossil fuels  combating climate change and promoting economic growth in rural communities    In October  in the face of a precipitous decline in the price of ethanol which threatens the viability of community sized ethanol plants and discourages private sector investment in cellulosic biomass ethanol technologies  Obama and Harkin introduced a bill that would boost the price of ethanol by requiring the use of more renewable fuels in the nation   s gasoline pool  Today   s high gas prices coupled with low ethanol prices are a clear indication that an increased RFS is needed   The updated RFS passed the Senate earlier this year in comprehensive energy legislation but is currently languishing due to controversy about other elements of that energy bill        If we   re going to get serious about investing in our energy future we must give our family farmers and local ethanol producers a fair shot at success     Senator Obama said      They have grown the ethanol industry from the ground up  and are demonstrating the potential of innovative technologies to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and moderate gas prices  But I continue to hear from farmers and the managers of community ethanol facilities about how this drop in the price of ethanol is not only threatening their livelihood but also the future of the biofuels industry  including the transition from corn ethanol to cellulosic biomass ethanol   The compromise bill announced by Sen  Reid and Speaker Pelosi today will prevent Big Oil from continuing to depress the ethanol market and help assure this promise is fulfilled          The potential for America to supply a great deal of our energy from domestic sources is enormous  but it is past time for government to provide a signal to producers  marketers and consumers of renewable fuels that we are serious about renewables as a long term and significant segment of our transportation fuel supply     said Harkin      Securing a new renewable fuels standard will ensure the continued viability and expansion of locally owned ethanol and biodiesel plants while providing a necessary incentive for investments in emerging  next generation biofuels production       Obama and Harkin also commended Reid and Pelosi for recognizing that U S  energy policy cannot ignore the effect of climate change and establishing of 20  50 and 60 percent carbon reduction targets for biofuels over the next 15 years    In May  Obama and Harkin introduced legislation establishing a national Low Carbon Fuel Standard which established similar goals       I am delighted to see this important legislation moving forward and I commend Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi     said Harkin       Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi deserve great credit for their vision in crafting this energy bill     Obama added       I share their view that it is time to lead the country toward a low carbon future  and I appreciate their acknowledgment that American agriculture has a prominent role to play in this effort                                    Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1
1769,"EMERGENCY HOME HEATING ASSISTANCE FOR VERMONT
  Vermont will receive $3.9 million for emergency home heating assistance. Senators Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy and Congressman Peter Welch announced the state's share of $450 million in national emergency funds as prices for home heating fuel are soaring to record highs this winter. Sanders has introduced legislation, cosponsored by Leahy, which would increase funding for the Low Income Home Heating Assistance Program by another $800 million. Welch introduced companion legislation in the U.S. House. ""The outrageously high price of home heating fuel is stretching the budgets of millions of families across the country,"" Sanders said. 
   ""Federal funding to help the most vulnerable people, including many seniors, is running out across Vermont,"" Sanders added. ""While I welcome this release of funds, the president should release $160 million remaining in the emergency fund immediately. People in Vermont and across this country must not go cold this winter. When the Senate reconvenes this month, I will bring to the floor legislation, with bipartisan support, which will increase LIHEAP funding by $800 million. Vermonters cannot afford to go any longer this winter without this necessary support.""
   Leahy said, ""This release of these emergency funds is welcome news that we have been asking and waiting for. With high heating costs pressing down on thousands of Vermont households this winter, we already know that additional funds from the LIHEAP reserve will be needed in our state after this.""
   Welch said, ""This critical funding is long-overdue. The high cost of heating fuel is crippling family budgets, threatening the well-being of many Vermonters already struggling to get by. Congress shouldn't have to continue to drag this president into recognizing the emergency so many Americans in cold-weather states face.""
   The U.S. average retail price for home heating oil soared 5.4 cents in one week in mid-January to a record $3.40 a gallon. The national heating oil price was up 98 cents from a year ago, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its weekly survey of heating fuel costs. It was the fourth week in a row that heating oil hit a record.
   In Vermont, community action programs on the front line of a severe heating crisis this winter already are running out of money. As of last week, for example, the Central Vermont Community Action Council had exhausted its entire $206,000 LIHEAP budget, and is negotiating with the state for more money. An additional $400,000 in LIHEAP funding is needed to make it through the rest of the winter, the council projected.
   The number of households receiving home heating assistance under the federal and state partnership program increased by 26 percent from 4.6 million in 2003 to about 5.8 million in 2007. During the same period, federal support for the program went up by only 10 percent. As a result, the average grant declined from $349 to $305 while energy prices continued to rise. The result has been a significant decrease in the program's purchasing power.
   According to the energy assistance directors, states plan to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding. The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5.8 million in 2007 to 4.9 million during the coming year.

December 8  2005  Obama and Salazar Ask Administration to Correct Medicare Part D Misinformation  Improve Preparedness  and Outline Steps to Prevent Fraud   WASHINGTON   On the 2nd anniversary of the enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug  Improvement  and Modernization Act of 2003  U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Ken Salazar  D CO  sent a letter to Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael O  Leavitt requesting that the Department outline the steps it has taken to correct misinformation it distributed  improve its ability to respond to and answer seniors  questions  and prevent fraud    Given the enormous health and financial implications  Americans have every right to expect that the benefit plan will be implemented in an efficient  comprehensible and fair manner   Obama and Salazar said   Two years after the enactment of this bill  we are deeply troubled by recent newspaper reports and complaints we have received from constituents that highlight flaws in the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit     In their letter  Obama and Salazar said they were troubled by reports that the 2006 Medicare   You handbook mailed to 42 million beneficiaries contained significant errors regarding the monthly premiums that plans will charge low income enrollees  The Senators asked Secretary Leavitt to outline actions HHS has taken to correct this and other misinformation  as well as explain steps it has taken improve its ability to respond to and answer questions and protect seniors from fraud  They requested a response by January 3  2006    We were not members of Congress in 2003 when the Medicare Modernization Act was enacted   Obama and Salazar said   We therefore have no political stake in defending or criticizing the merits of the law that created the prescription drug benefit  As public servants  however  we have every interest in ensuring that seniors and people with disabilities receive reliable  accurate information  that the federal government prohibits insurers and agents from victimizing seniors in the marketing of the plans  that seniors and people with disabilities get the assistance necessary to make informed choices  and that the prescription benefit is properly implemented     Below  please find the full text of the letter                                                      December 8  2005   The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20201    Dear Secretary Leavitt     As you know  during the next few weeks  millions of America s seniors and people with disabilities face the difficult task of selecting a Medicare prescription drug plan   As you also know  we were not members of Congress in 2003 when the Medicare Modernization Act  MMA  was enacted   We therefore have no political stake in defending or criticizing the merits of the law that created the prescription drug benefit   As public servants  however  we have every interest in ensuring that seniors and people with disabilities receive reliable  accurate information  that the federal government prohibits insurers and agents from victimizing seniors in the marketing of the plans  that seniors and people with disabilities get the assistance necessary to make informed choices  and that the prescription benefit is properly implemented     Given the enormous health and financial implications  Americans have every right to expect that the benefit plan will be implemented in an efficient  comprehensible and fair manner   Two years after the enactment of the MMA  we are deeply troubled by recent newspaper reports and complaints we have received from constituents that highlight flaws in the implementation of the Medicare drug benefit     For example  misinformation provided by your Department has caused significant confusion   The 2006 Medicare   You handbook mailed to 42 million beneficiaries contained significant errors regarding the monthly premiums that plans will charge low income enrollees   The informational insert published in Parade magazine misrepresented the Medicare drug benefit as more generous than it really is   Moreover  when beneficiaries call 1 800 MEDICARE  the primary source for information regarding the drug benefit  they often encounter automated messages requesting that they call back   Many beneficiaries complain that when they are connected to a live person  the operators are unable to answer all but the most basic questions regarding the benefit plans   Given the lack of accurate information available to beneficiaries  it is no surprise that a recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the majority of seniors do not understand the Medicare drug benefit       Recent newspaper reports also reveal that seniors may be at risk of being defrauded by unscrupulous insurers and agents who reportedly have visited their residences uninvited  pressured them to select particular plans  misrepresented plans  and requested personal information such as Social Security numbers and banking information   Although it is impossible to completely prevent fraudulent activities by unscrupulous persons  it does not appear that state and federal authorities have a coordinated plan of action to deter fraudulent conduct and to swiftly prosecute insurers and agents who engage in illegal activities   Implementation of the new drug benefit should not be an open invitation for scam artists to take advantage of senior citizens        In light of these reports  we strongly urge you to take immediate action to address these concerns  and request that you provide our offices with answers to the following questions as soon as possible   What actions has your Department taken to correct the misinformation provided to beneficiaries   Does your Department have a way to determine whether the corrected information is reaching beneficiaries Is there an adequate communications strategy for interacting with individuals with disabilities or for those without sufficient English or reading abilities Are the 1 800 MEDICARE informational centers properly staffed to respond to the inquiries What actions has your Department taken to ensure that operators who staff the 1 800 MEDICARE information centers are properly trained to meaningfully respond to questions concerning the benefit plans  Is there a coordinated plan between federal and state authorities to investigate and prosecute insurers  agents and others who engage in fraudulent and otherwise illegal conduct in marketing and selling the benefit plans   If so  what is the plan What actions has the Department implemented to deter fraudulent conduct in the marketing of the plans  including monitoring the conduct of authorized plan insurers      We request that you provide this information to us by January 3  2006      We owe Medicare beneficiaries clarity  fairness  and our best efforts to implement the benefit plan   Similarly  we owe our Americans assurances that their tax dollars are spent wisely and efficiently   We look forward to reviewing your response  and to overseeing effective  timely interventions to address the shortcomings of the implementation effort to date          Sincerely

1637,August 1  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for Passage of Bill to Enable More Children to Benefit from the Children s Health Insurance Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Urges Support for Clinton Amendment to Extend Family and Medical Leave for Families of Wounded Soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today spoke on the floor of the Senate  urging passage of legislation to cover more children under the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP    She also called on her colleagues to support bipartisan legislation  cosponsored by Senators Dole  Mikulski  Graham  Kennedy and Brown  that she has introduced as an amendment to the SCHIP bill that would extend the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA  for up to six months for spouses and parents of soldiers who have been injured in combat   The amendment would enact a key recommendation of the Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors      The following is a transcript of Senator Clinton s remarks on the Senate floor     Mr  President  I want to thank my colleague from Washington for her usual  very thorough  and persuasive statement on the floor about the need for flexibility in this important program and the recognition that healthcare  like everything else  costs differently depending upon where you are in the country  And I thank the Senator from Washington for reinforcing that important point     But the larger point is this  today in this Congress  we are on the verge of providing the greatest expansion of health coverage for our children since the creation of the Children s Health Insurance Program a decade ago  I believe  and I don t imagine anyone in this chamber would argue  with the belief that every child deserves a healthy start in life  Certainly  we try to provide that healthy start for our own children and we give a lot of lip service to the idea that we should provide it for all children  yet far too many children in our nation    more than nine million    do not have healthcare     I was very proud to help create the State Children s Health Insurance Program during the Clinton Administration  working on this legislation during my time as First Lady  And after the bill passed  I worked to get the word out and try to help more children and their parents understand what this new program could mean for them and encourage them to sign up in the first few years  In the Senate  I have continued that effort  fighting to ensure healthcare for children has the priority in our budget that it deserves     So today  thanks to the work of so many  CHIP provides health insurance for six million children  Now  in New York alone  almost 400 000 children benefit from this program every month     With the legislation that Chairman Baucus and Senators Grassley  Rockefeller and Hatch helped to craft  an additional 50 000 children in my state of New York will have access to health insurance coverage  This legislation will also help enroll many of the 300 000 children in New York who live in families that are already eligible because their families make less than  52 000 a year  250 percent of the poverty level for a family of four  In total across our country  3 2 million children who are uninsured will gain coverage   That will reduce the number of uninsured children by  one third over the next five years      Now  Mr  President  if we can afford tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and tax cuts for oil companies that are making record profits  I certainly think we can find it in our hearts and budget to help cover millions of children who deserve a healthy start     I want to be clear  if the president vetoes this bill  he will be vetoing healthcare for more than three million children  And once again the President will have put ideology  not children  first     Earlier this year  I was proud to introduce legislation with Congressman John Dingell to reauthorize and expand CHIP  and I m very pleased that a number of the ideas in our bill are included in this legislation  such as cutting the red tape and bolstering incentives to get eligible children into the program     The legislation also improves access to private coverage and expands access to benefits like mental health and dental coverage  This is so important    And I really applaud the Finance Committee under Chairman Baucus  leadership   Mental health and dental coverage are too often left out when we talk about healthcare      Well  not far from where I m standing  in the state of Maryland  last year  a young boy  Deamonte Driver  had a toothache  And his mother sought help for him to be able to get dental care  She called dentists  but they weren t taking any more children on Medicaid or on CHIP  and then she got help from a legal aid group that helped poor families  They called around  and I think they called 27 or 28 dentists who said  look  our quota for poor kids is filled     Well  Deamonte Driver s toothache turned into an abscess  And the abscess burst  infecting his bloodstream  and he ended up in the hospital where doctors valiantly tried to save his life from the brain infection that resulted from the abscessed tooth that had not been treated  This young man died     And when one thinks about the loss of a child over something that started as a toothache  it is heartbreaking  but it is not by any means an isolated case  And at the end of Deamonte s life  the state of Maryland and the United States government ended up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for emergency care  for intensive care  for life support to no avail  for want of  80 100 to find a dentist who would care for Deamonte     So  I really commend the authors of this bipartisan bill for their work and for bringing forward a practical  fiscally responsible compromise that will allow us to reauthorize this important program and expand coverage  And I m eager to see that it is signed into law     I am disappointed  however  that the bill we are considering this week fails to include the Legal Immigrant Children s Health Improvement Act  which I introduced with Senator Snowe   Senator Snowe and I have been working on this for a number of years  This bipartisan bill would give states the flexibility to provide the same Medicaid and CHIP coverage to low income  legal immigrant children and pregnant women as is provided to U S  Citizens  I will underscore that  we are talking about legal immigrant children and legal pregnant women     I really believe that we should provide this flexibility to states because the current restrictions prevent thousands of legal immigrant children and pregnant women from receiving preventive health services and treatment for minor illnesses before they become serious  Families who are unable to access care for their children have little choice but to turn to emergency rooms  And this hurts children and pregnant women  plain and simple   And I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to lift the ban on Medicaid and CHIP coverage for low income  legal immigrant children and pregnant women     I also am disappointed that some of my colleagues have expressed concern about states like New York  New Jersey and others that have chosen to cover children above 300 percent of the poverty level  The legislation we are considering on the floor would allow New York to continue doing this and receive the CHIP matching rate  We should not punish children and their families who live in high cost areas and who need healthcare coverage  And I encourage my colleagues to vote against any effort to undermine the extension of healthcare in high cost states where it costs more  as we heard from Senator Cantwell and her statement on the floor  to provide the same coverage and treatment one would get elsewhere in our country     So  I m proud that we are debating a bill to expand healthcare to 3 2 million children  But the fact is  there should be no debating the moral crisis of nine million children without healthcare  no debating the moral urgency of strengthening our healthcare system for children and all Americans  Ultimately  Mr  President  the answer will be in a cost effective  quality driven  uniquely American program that provides healthcare to every single man  woman  and child in our country  But until we get to that point  it is imperative that the Congress pass this bill before we go out for recess and send it to the president with the hope that he will sign it into law     I would also like to mention another issue we urgently need to address  Last week  the bipartisan Commission on Care for America s Returning Wounded Warriors    chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services  Donna Shalala    issued its final report on the need to reform the medical care that our troops and veterans receive     The commission found  in an excellent reportit s not one of these commission reports that just take up a lot of space on the shelf  its very pointed with six specific recommendationsand it found that one of the most important ways to improve care for injured servicemembers is to improve support for their families  That s why I introduced a bipartisan bill  the Military Family and Medical Leave Act with Senators Dole  Mikulski  Graham  Kennedy and Brown  to implement a key recommendation of the commission  And we have offered this as an amendment to the CHIP legislation     The Family and Medical Leave Act was the first bill signed into law under the Clinton Administration  It came about because of a lot of hard work led by Senator Dodd here in the Senate and others  and it has proven to be enormously successful  helping more than 60 million men and women who try to balance the demands of work and family  I believe it is time to strengthen the Act for military families who find themselves in a very difficult situation  They should be given up to six months of leave to care for a loved one who has sustained a combat related injury     Currently  these spouses  parents  and children can receive only 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act  All too often  this is just not enough time  as injured servicemembers grapple with traumatic brain injuries  severe physical wounds and other problems upon returning from Iraq  Afghanistan  and elsewhere     In fact  33 percent of active duty  22 percent of reservists  and 37 percent of retired servicemembers reported to the commission that a family member or close friend had to leave their homes for extended periods of time to help them in the hospital  About 20 percent said family or friends gave up jobs to be with them to act as their caregiver     This is a step that we can take immediately that will make a real difference  Many of us have been to hospitals here in our own countryWalter Reed  Brook Army Medical Center   and other places in the world  like Landstuhl in Germany  where we ve seen our wounded warriors  There is no doubt that having the support  assistance and comfort of a family member during that process when a young man or woman who has served our country is brought from the battlefield to the hospital  makes a big difference in recovery and rehabilitation  I think all of us agree that not only do our men and women in uniform make tremendous sacrifices on our behalf  so do their families  And as a nation  we have a duty to provide them with the support that they deserve to have     So  Mr  President  expanding access to healthcare for children and providing better support for our military families comes down to basic values that we as Americans hold dear  I think we all agree every child deserves a healthy start and every man or woman who wears the uniform of our country deserves more than words of support  The promise of America is rooted in these values  and I am very proud to support the bipartisan legislation expanding healthcare for children  And I urge my colleagues to join me and the Senators from both sides of the aisle who are supporting our military families who are caring for those who have been injured in service to our country     And  Mr  President  finally  we hope that on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue there will be a change of heart  that the president will decide to sign this legislation and relieve the burdens of ill health and inadequate access to healthcare that haunt the lives of so many American families  Mr  President  please support this effort in every way possible by signing the legislation that will be sent to you  I yield the floor         ,0

1840,"GLOBAL WARMING AND CITY HALL
  The federal government clearly must do more to fight global warming, and Senator Bernie Sanders has played a leading role in prodding Congress to act responsibly. While Washington debates what to do, however, many cities are taking the lead. More than 700 mayors have signed a pledge to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. In an address to a U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington, Sanders laid out ways a new federal energy bill could help cities meet their goals.

                Announcement by Six Government Agencies Today Reflects Clinton Bishop Legislation and Cooperation of New York and Connecticut

               Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Tim Bishop  NY 01  today applauded the announcement by six government agencies that they have reached an accord to manage Long Island Sound Dredged Materials and have agreed on a process to support the goal of reducing or eliminating open water disposal of dredged materials into the Sound while maintaining the economic viability of New York and Connecticut s working ports          The agreement announced today is between the United States Environmental Protection Agency  United States Army Corps of Engineers  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection  New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and New York State Department of State  The agreement formally ratifies the parties  intention to administer a Regional Dredging Team to assist with options for the management of dredged materials while the larger Dredged Material Management Plan is being developed           In March of 2004  the EPA had proposed to designate two sites in the Long Island Sound as disposal sites for dredge material  Responding to environmental concerns about the proposal  Clinton and Bishop introduced legislation to require the development of a Dredge Material Management Plan that would govern disposal in the Sound  As part of that process  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA were to evaluate upland disposal options and dump only the cleanest dredge material as a matter of last resort  The deal announced by these agencies today is an important step in their goal of protecting the Long Island Sound           I am pleased that these federal agencies and the states of New York and Connecticut have come to this agreement to build on the fundamental principles we put forward in our bill  and protect the Long Island Sound  This agreement sets in place the framework necessary to protect this magnificent resource from the dumping of contaminated materials   said Senator Clinton   This is certainly a welcome improvement on the original proposal which was totally unacceptable to everyone who recognizes the value of the Sound  This agreement promises a much better approach to the management of the Sound and we will continue to monitor their progress as they move forward            This agreement recognizes that the Long Island Sound is a valuable natural resource  not an aquatic landfill   Representative Bishop said    We have come a long way from the original plan which would have been environmentally devastating to the health of the Sound   I m pleased that the legislation Senator Clinton and I offered served as the catalyst for this solution   This effort reminds us that when we work together and seek creative answers  we can do things that protect the health and safety of the Long Island Sound            According to the announcement today  the agreement ratifies the intent of three federal and three state agencies to formally administer a Regional Dredging Team to comply with the June 3  2005  rulemaking by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  USEPA  that designated open water dredged material disposal sites in Central Long Island Sound  CLIS  and Western Long Island Sound  WLIS   The establishment of the Regional Dredging Team will assist dredging proponents in considering and evaluating various management options for their dredged material while a larger effort to develop a Dredged Material Management Plan  DMMP  for Long Island Sound is being conducted  The agreement covers dredging projects in both New York State and Connecticut waters           The deal by the six agencies establishes a Long Island Sound Regional Dredging Team that will            Review all federal dredging projects  and those non federal dredging projects proposing more than 25 000 cubic yards of open water disposal at WLIS or CLIS            Evaluate all available information to ensure that a thorough effort has been conducted to identify practicable alternatives            Ensure that beneficial use alternatives are used whenever practical for some or all of the material            Enhance communication and discussion among the participating agencies             Facilitate timely review and presentation of recommendations for the management and beneficial use of dredged material from the Sound  and              Provide advice on dredged material management for other dredging projects located on or in tributaries to the Sound            Senator Clinton and Congressman Bishop have

1939,"SEN. SANDERS CALLS BUSH BUDGET 'UNCONSCIONABLE'
  Senator Bernie Sanders said today that President Bush's new budget proposal was ""unconscionable"" and reflected ""grossly distorted"" priorities.
   While providing hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the richest 1 percent of Americans, Bush proposed major cuts in health care, home heating assistance, weatherization, nutrition and housing programs. He also wants to raise fees on veterans' health care. 
   ""At a time when the middle class is shrinking and poverty is increasing and we are likely entering a recession, President Bush's budget does nothing to strengthen the economy and fails to respond to the real needs of ordinary Americans,"" said Sanders (I-Vt.). What kind of distorted consciousness exists in the White House when the president wants to give huge tax breaks to millionaires, while he cuts back on such basic services as health care, home heating assistance, nutrition, housing and weatherization? As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I will do everything I can to make sure that Bush's budget is rejected, and we bring forth a new budget that works for the vast majority of Americans, not just the wealthy few.""
   Under the $3.1 trillion budget proposal, cuts to Medicare alone would amount to about $600 billion over 10 years, a savings achieved by freezing payments to hospitals and other health care providers. ""The cuts Bush wants in Medicare and Medicaid for the elderly and poor would make it even harder for those and other Americans struggling with rising health care costs,"" Sanders said.
   Bush also seeks to eliminate or sharply slash programs such as home heating assistance, nutritional benefits, job training and weatherization.
   Many veterans would face new fees for health care with an annual enrollment fee ranging from $250 to $750. Prescription drug co-payments for some veterans would go up by $8 to $15.
   Defense Department outlays spelled out in the budget for the fiscal year beginning next October 1 fail to account for the growing cost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while letting the Pentagon continue spending on outmoded Cold War weapons systems.
   Sanders favors rescinding tax breaks for the wealthiest 1 percent and cutting wasteful defense spending. ""Instead of giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while cutting back on health care, the time has come for the wealthiest people and the most profitable corporations in this country to pay their fair share,"" Sanders said.
   Highlights and lowlights of the Bush budget include:
   * A cut of nearly $200 billion to Medicare and Medicaid over the next five years, and about $600 billion over the next decade which will compound the problems facing seniors and millions of other Americans struggling amid ever-rising health care costs.
   * A complete elimination of the $243 million Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program. Over the last three decades, this program has successfully weatherized 5.5 million homes throughout the country, reduced energy costs for homeowners, improved the environment and created good-paying jobs.
   * A $570 million cut to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program at a time when senior citizens on fixed incomes and low-income families with children struggle to pay to heat their homes this winter.
   * A 29 percent cut in funding to train nurses, despite the fact that the United States faces a severe nursing shortage.
   * A complete elimination of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, a vital nutrition program primarily for low-income seniors but also serving mothers, infants and children across the country. The program provided more than 6 million food packages to nearly 500,000 low-income seniors, mothers and children across the country in 2007, including more than 4,000 Vermonters.
   * A $484 million cut to job training and employment programs at a time when the unemployment rate is going up.
   * A complete elimination of the $654 million Community Services Block Grant program, one of the most successful anti-poverty programs in the country which has provided millions of Americans with emergency food assistance, employment, affordable housing and heating assistance. The block grants provide about $3.3 million in federal funding to five community action programs in Vermont that help more than 40,000 low-income Vermonters every year with heating assistance, weatherization, employment, housing, and emergency food.
   * An 86 percent cut in Rural Health Programs.
   * A $195 million cut to elderly housing.
   * A $77 million reduction in housing assistance for the disabled.
   * A $280 million cut to the Violence Against Women program.
   * A cut of more than $1 billion for rural housing.
   * A $900 million cut to the Community Development Block Grant Program, the signature program for cities, counties and local communities to create jobs, spur economic development and small business opportunities, and expand homeownership.

                                                                         Obama  Akaka  Tester Seek Information on Apparent Failure to Investigate Rape Allegations Against Halliburton KBR Employees in Iraq Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jesse Broder Van Dyke  Akaka   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Aaron Murphy  Tester    Washington  DC     U S  Senators Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Barack Obama  D IL   and Jon Tester  D MT  today sent letters to the Attorney General  and the Inspector Generals of the Defense and State Departments  seeking information about their apparent failure to investigate allegations made by former Halliburton KBR administrative assistant Jamie Leigh Jones that she was drugged and raped by several co workers while employed at Camp Hope in Baghdad  Iraq     The alleged assault occurred in July 2005  three days after KBR had transferred Ms  Jones to work in Iraq   Ms  Jones was treated at a U S  Army Hospital in Iraq after reporting that she was raped   According to recent news reports  no criminal charges have been filed in the matter and reporters have been unable to confirm that any federal agency is investigating       With tens of thousands of American contractors operating in Iraq  we will not tolerate abuse and misconduct  and these contractors must be held accountable to American criminal law     said Senator Obama      I first introduced legislation nearly 10 months ago to hold contractors accountable  and I will continue to work to develop a solution that closes the legal loopholes  protects our troops and civilians  and promotes America   s values     Senator Akaka said     It has been more than two years since Ms  Jones reported that she was drugged and raped   Ms  Jones    allegations are extremely disturbing  yet it seems that KBR  the Defense Department  and the State Department may have ignored the matter rather than seeking the truth   Some media accounts have suggested that security contractors have blanket legal immunity for what they do in Iraq   That is untrue   But the existing legal loopholes for U S  government contractors working abroad     and the widespread perception that these contractors operate completely free of legal constraints     must be addressed   Congress should make this an urgent priority     Akaka noted that jurisdiction for any future criminal charges brought in the case could come under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 or section 804 of the USA PATRIOT Act      We must ensure that security contractors are subject to real oversight   I will push for a full  fair  and transparent investigation of Jamie Leigh Jones    allegations  and I will continue to support legislation to ensure that security contractors are held to high standards     Akaka stated       I don   t care if it   s in rural Montana  inner city Washington  or military bases in Baghdad   no one is above the law     Senator Tester said      We   ve got some serious questions about this case and it   s not acceptable to sit around waiting for answers     Senator Akaka is Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management  the Federal Workforce  and the District of Columbia  as well as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness   Senators Obama and Tester are

Illinois Senator Says Commitment Would Greatly Increase Consumer Access to E85     WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent a letter to Mr  H  Lee Scott  Jr   Chief Executive Officer of Wal Mart Stores  Inc   and to other top executives of hypermarket chains  which include major national and regional merchandisers  club stores  discount chains and national supermarket chains  asking them to commit to installing alternative fuel pumps at all store locations that sell gasoline    It is clear that alternative fuels are our energy future   Obama wrote   That market is up for grabs  and the resistance of conventional branded gasoline retailers to offering E 85 at their service stations creates an opportunity for companies like yours     It is estimated that the more than 3 600 hypermarket stores that sell gasoline will comprise up to 15  of national retail fuel sales within three years  Obama said that a commitment from these large companies to sell alternative fuels like E85  a blended fuel comprised of 85  ethanol and 15  gasoline  would greatly increase access to alternative fuels and help make America more energy independent      Given the large size of your company  a decision to offer this product at your retail fuel stations would contribute to building the infrastructure necessary to meet consumer demand and reduce dramatically our nation s reliance on foreign petroleum   Obama wrote   By announcing a new corporate policy to offer alternative fuels at all of your retail refueling stations  your company would demonstrate its commitment to investing in American made fuels and to protecting our nation s energy security and environment     E85 can be used in Flexible Fuel Vehicles  FFVs   which can also use unleaded fuel when E85 isn t available  Standard vehicles can burn fuel with a 10 percent ethanol mix  Ford Motor Co  Vice President Sue Cischke said last week that  We need about 30 times the   E85 ethanol pumps available today   to accommodate the more than 5 million flexible fuel vehicles currently on the road  It is estimated that only approximately 700 of the 165 000 publicly accessible gas stations sell E85    Stores that choose to install alternative fuel pumps would be eligible to receive a tax credit of up to  30 000 to offset the cost of installation  This tax credit was championed by Senator Obama and became law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005    Obama s letter was sent to executives at  Wal Mart Stores  Inc   Safeway  Inc   Costco Wholesale Corporation  The Kroger Company  Meijer  Inc

fuels  such as ethanol and biodiesel  by the year 2012  and provides a tax credit for the installation of alternative fuel refueling pumps to expand consumer access to these new fuels    It is estimated that there are more than 3 600 hypermart supermarket gasoline sites in the United States  which could comprise up to 15  of national retail fuel sales within three years   Given that your company and similar mass retailers continue to expand into retail fuel markets  I urge you to commit to the installation of alternative fuel refueling pumps at each of your retail stations so that your customers will have full access to domestically produced  environmentally friendly alternative fuels  such as E 85  which is an 85  renewable ethanol 15  gasoline mixture   The nation is at a crossroads in energy policy   Our choice is to continue to cling to fossil fuels as the cornerstone of our supply  or to take advantage of existing technology and the emerging consumer preference for non petroleum based fuels     It is clear that alternative fuels are our energy future   That market is up for grabs  and the resistance of conventional branded gasoline retailers to offering E 85 at their service stations creates an opportunity for companies like yours     As production capacity of E 85 continues to rise and automakers increase production of flexible fuel vehicles  expanding consumer access to this new fuel is critical and prescient   Given the large size of your company  a decision to offer this product at your retail fuel stations would contribute to building the infrastructure necessary to meet consumer demand and reduce dramatically our nation s reliance on foreign petroleum   Moreover  by announcing a new corporate policy to offer alternative fuels at all of your retail refueling stations  your company would demonstrate its commitment to investing in American made fuels and to protecting our nation s energy security and environment     I appreciate your consideration of this request    Sincerely    Barack Obama           United States Senator                                   ,1
1834,"IT'S THE ECONOMY
  The Senate returned to Washington amid mounting worries over the U.S. economy that triggered a global market meltdown. Lawmakers already have begun to work on a package of targeted tax cuts and investments. Tax rebates for working families, a Sanders' brainchild approved by Congress the last time the economy faltered, now are widely seen as a remedy for recession. ""It is important that we move quickly,"" Sanders told Vermont Public Radio. ""Obviously you want to put money in the hands of people who need it the most. They're the ones who are going to spend it the quickest,"" he added. Sanders also favors a massive investment in public works projects that have been neglected for too long anyway. Another effective tool to spur the economy - and help the environment in the process - would be to devote significant sums of money to programs that improve energy efficiency.  
   Sanders' long-standing concern about the shrinking middle class and increasing poverty foreshadowed the current economic woes. 
   At long last even President Bush, who had ignored warning signs for years, is now concerned. The president and congressional leaders were looking for quick agreement on how to pump as much as $150 billion in tax cuts and government spending into the ailing economy to head off a recession. The Associated Press reported that they were negotiating terms of a stimulus bill that would provide tax rebates, business tax cuts and funding for a Democratic-led call for additional food stamp and employment aid. 
   As the White House and hill leaders negotiated a stimulus package, global stock markets plunged because of spreading fears that a U.S. recession will drag down the economies world wide. 
   Citing the worsening economic outlook, the Federal Reserve Board this morning in a surprise move cut a key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 3.5 percent, in an emergency bid to prop up the weak U.S. economy.

1962,"SEN. SANDERS SUPPORTS VETERANS FROM DOCKING
  The Senate on Thursday approved an amendment by Senator Bernie Sanders that would stop the Department of Veterans Affairs from docking veterans' benefits when it rounds down disability payments. The amendment ""addresses a concern within the veterans' community that the United States government is nickel-and-diming veterans in an absolutely shameful way,"" Sanders told Senate colleagues. 
   The amendment would stop the Department of Veterans Affairs from pocketing the change when it calculates benefits. For example, Sanders said, a veteran due $200.99 a month now gets a benefit check for $200.
   While the short-term impact on individual veterans is relatively small, Sanders said the issue ""is enormously significant to the millions of men and women who have served our country in war, and it is especially relevant to disabled veterans."" 
   The long-term, cumulative impact of the accounting practice ""substantially erodes the value of compensation,"" according to veterans' organizations, and ""robs monies from the benefits of some of our most deserving veterans and their dependents and survivors, who must rely on their modest VA compensation for the necessities of life.""
   Sanders' amendment would add $20 million to the Department of Veterans Affairs budget to cover the full amount of benefits veterans have earned.
   The provision was supported by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign War, the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and AMVETS.

688,   Obama Criticizes VA Decision to Review 72 000 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Cases   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Criticizes VA Decision to Review 72 000 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Cases Wednesday  August 10  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 10  2005  Obama Criticizes VA Decision to Review 72 000 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Cases VA Review Only Includes Vets Awarded Full Benefits  not Those Denied   WASHINGTON   In a letter to Veterans  Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today criticized the VA s decision to review more than 70 000 cases where veterans were awarded full benefits for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  cases  while not reviewing any cases where veterans may have been denied benefits they earned     In order to truly create fairness in the claims system  the VA should concentrate its efforts on reviewing denials of PTSD claims   said Obama   Without assessing why some PTSD claims are denied  it will be impossible to fully understand how the VA s PTSD rating system can be improved     According to recent news reports  the VA will review 72 000 cases in which the maximum amount of PTSD disability benefits was awarded because of the VA s belief that 2 5  of these cases are  potentially fraudulent   Obama said this review is long and stressful  and that veterans should not be forced to unnecessarily prove their cases again     The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD disability is extremely time consuming   said Obama   It requires the compilation of medical records  military service records  and testimony from other veterans who can attest to a person s combat exposure  I cannot fathom why VA would require veterans to go through this emotionally painful process for a second time     Previously  the VA considered adopting a policy that required any new case where a veteran is awarded service connected PTSD benefits to be reviewed by two raters  Senator Obama raised his objections with this policy in a letter dated June 21  2005  The policy was later discarded  Obama said the VA should create uniform standards for evaluating PTSD claims     The VA   and our nation s veterans   would be better served by creating nationwide standards for evaluating PTSD claims   said Obama   As the Inspector General s report underscored  PTSD is a highly subjective evaluation subject to significant variation  The variation in PTSD ratings across the country may well be the result of a lack of training or standardized practices on the part of the VA  instead of fraud on the part of our nation s veterans      In December  Senator Obama learned that Illinois veterans have received disproportionately less disability pay  on average  than veterans in 49 of the 52 states and territories for the past two decades  Obama asked the VA to issue a report detailing how this disparity occurred  which found that  variance in 100 percent PTSD cases is a primary factor contributing to the variance in average annual compensation by state   For example  New Mexico has the highest payment average of  12 004  and 12 6 percent of its veterans are in this group  Illinois has the lowest average payment of  6 961 and only 2 8 percent of its compensation recipients are rated 100 percent for PTSD     The Senate VA committee recently passed the Veterans  Benefits Improvement Act of 2005  which included an amendment offered by Senator Obama to require the VA to standardize the assessment of PTSD claims     August 10  2005   The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20420   Dear Secretary Nicholson                I am writing to express my serious concerns about recent news reports that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  is reviewing 72 000 post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  cases between 1999 and 2004 in which veterans received the maximum amount of disability benefits   This appears to be yet another attempt by the Bush Administration to put roadblocks in front of veterans who are trying to obtain the benefits they earned and deserve                I first raised this issue with you in a letter dated June 21  2005   In that letter  I strongly objected to a VA proposal to require a concurring second signature for PTSD cases in which benefits were granted   I was concerned that the VA had no similar plans to examine whether veterans were being unfairly denied PTSD claims and was only interested in determining whether some veterans were getting too much money   While I recognize the budgetary crisis that the VA is facing  it is wrong for the VA to ignore the possibility that many veterans have been unjustly denied their earned benefits                      In your response to my letter dated July 6  2005  you indicated that VA would not pursue the proposed second signature policy   I was pleased with the change in policy  but I am disturbed that the VA has now chosen to ignore my initial concerns                 According to an August 9  2005  article in Salon  the VA will review 72 000 cases in which the maximum amount of PTSD disability benefits was awarded because of VA s belief that 2 5  of these cases are  potentially fraudulent     It is inherently unfair to review only cases in which PTSD benefits were granted while ignoring cases in which benefits were denied                 Equally troubling is the message that such a mandatory review of PTSD claims sends to the brave men and women who defended this country   Too many veterans see the VA as a bureaucracy with the singular goal of denying services and benefits to veterans   This recent decision to reopen granted PTSD claims merely serves to promote that impression   It is unconscionable for our government to put the onus on law abiding veterans to affirmatively demonstrate that they are not engaging in fraud   The process of gathering evidence to prove PTSD disability is extremely time consuming   It requires the compilation of medical records  military service records  and testimony from other veterans who can attest to a person s combat exposure   I cannot fathom why VA would require veterans to go through this emotionally painful process for a second time       The VA   and our nation s veterans   would be better served by creating nationwide standards for evaluating PTSD claims   As the Inspector General s report underscored  PTSD is a highly subjective evaluation subject to significant variation   The variation in PTSD ratings across the country may well be the result of a lack of training or standardized practices on the part of the VA  instead of fraud on the part of our nation s veterans     In order to truly create fairness in the claims system  the VA should concentrate its efforts on reviewing denials of PTSD claims   Without assessing why some PTSD claims are denied  it will be impossible to fully understand how the VA s PTSD rating system can be improved   In any event  any analysis of PTSD claims should not require veterans to readjudicate their claims   The veterans  disability benefits process is already long and

458,   Obama  McCaskill Initiative Would Improve Treatment for Servicemembers   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  McCaskill Initiative Would Improve Treatment for Servicemembers Tuesday  March 27  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACT  Ben LaBolt  Amendment would ensure soldiers are cared for after they return home from war WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  were today joined by Senators Kerry  D MA   Cantwell  D WA   Biden  D DE   Harkin  D IA   Mikulski  D MD   and Bingaman  D NM  in introducing an amendment to the Iraq supplemental bill that would improve care for servicemembers at active duty military hospitals by adding caseworkers and mental health counselors  reducing bureaucratic hurdles  establishing a women   s mental health treatment program and providing a comprehensive mental health study to ensure that the needs of returning soldiers are met   The amendment is based on S  713  the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  which Obama and McCaskill in February  Key provisions of the amendment are  More Caseworkers     The Post series found that servicemembers waited on average 209 days to get their disability paperwork processed because caseworkers were overwhelmed by the large number of patients   During this period of limbo  servicemembers have no idea whether they   re going to remain on active duty  whether they   re going to be discharged and  if so  how much they will receive in benefits   In order to speed up the processing of paperwork  the amendment provides  41 million to hire 10 additional caseworkers at each of the 75 military hospitals  More Mental Health and Crisis Counselors     The Post series found that many servicemembers had insufficient access to counselors to help them with psychological problems resulting from their combat service and injuries   Nor did families of servicemembers have access to counselors to help them cope with the challenges and stresses they would face   The amendment provides  17 million to hire 4 additional caseworkers at each of the 75 military hospitals   Electronic Submission of Paperwork     Recovering servicemembers are forced to navigate a confusing DOD bureaucracy that requires them to submit numerous documents to different offices  which often lose the documents   To address this problem  the amendment provides  30 million for the Armed Forces to develop a new secure system to allow recovering servicemembers to submit required paperwork on the Internet and to allow the Armed Forces to track and review paperwork on the Internet  Women   s Mental Health Treatment Program     A recent New York Times Magazine story found that women soldiers face particular mental health issues  particularly given the high number of women soldiers who are the victims of sexual assault and harassment   The amendment provides  15 million for DOD to develop a women s mental health treatment program  including the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors  to assist female servicemembers who have experienced post traumatic stress disorder or sexual assault and abuse   Comprehensive Study of Mental Health Needs     Following the Vietnam War  a comprehensive study of the mental health needs of returning soldiers was not conducted until 1983     15 years after the height of the war   That is too late   This amendment requires the National Academy of Sciences to study the mental health needs of returning Iraq and Afghanistan servicemembers based on the landmark 1983 National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study   Senator Obama   s remarks on the amendment are below  Towards the end of World War II  Norman Rockwell created a cover for the Saturday Evening Post titled     Homecoming G I       It is a picture of a soldier returning from war   He has a duffle bag clutched in his left hand   He   s looking up at the back of a brick building with laundry hanging from the back porch   A woman in an apron sees him with outstretched arms and a young child races down the stairs   Everyone sees that soldier     the neighbor   s kids  the man fixing the roof  faces from another window     and everyone welcomes that soldier who   s come home from war   That is what our nation did for the millions of service members who returned from the Atlantic and the Pacific   We watched them come home in waves  some were just as strong as their first day in battle  others limped   We saw them crowd Times Square   We saw them walk down Main Streets and sit on stoops   And my grandfather  who fought in Patton   s army  would often speak about this time as America at its finest   That Homecoming didn   t just happen  we were ready for it   Long before the beaches of Normandy were stormed and the last battle was fought  in 1943  President Roosevelt said         Among many other things we are  today  laying plans for the return to civilian life of our gallant men and women in the armed services  They must not be demobilized into an environment of inflation and unemployment  to a place on a bread line  or on a corner selling apples  We must  this time  have plans ready     instead of waiting to do a hasty  inefficient  and ill considered job at the last moment      These are words of wisdom that we ignore at our peril   Today  we have more than 631 000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan and other parts of the Global War on Terror   According to a recent VA health care report  one third   more than 205 000   have sought treatment at VA health facilities   Even if the war in Iraq comes to an end soon     and I hope the Senate takes action this week to accomplish that goal     the war will live on with our service members and their families for the rest of our lives   Unfortunately  over the past month  we have all seen the disturbing pictures of neglect at Walter Reed   We have read about bats and bureaucratic red tape at the VA   We have seen too many stories about our veterans who have been forgotten   not greeted by the nation that asked them to serve   The time has come for us to see this generation of veterans in all their valor and pain   We should provide them with a plan that is worthy of their courage and will help build back the military they love   That is what Senator McCaskill and I are trying to do with the amendment we offer today   First  we provide an additional  41 million to hire more caseworkers to assist service members navigating the military   s bureaucracy   The last thing a wounded service member should have to face when they return home is a frontline of paper work and delay   Right now  the caseworker to service member ratio at Walter Reed is 1 to 50   Caseworkers help recovering soldiers schedule appointments  care for their everyday needs  and help them fill out paperwork   Military caseworkers are overwhelmed   I understand that the Army is reducing the caseworker to service member ratio to 1 in 17   I applaud this move and our amendment would help the military achieve this goal at all military hospitals   Our amendment also provides  30 million for the armed forces to create an Internet based system for service members to submit their paperwork electronically   No longer will amputees and servicemembers in wheelchairs have to go to countless offices to fill out duplicative forms  only to learn that the forms have been lost in the government bureaucracy   We also need to do more to increase the number of mental health crisis counselors available to assist recovering service members and their families   Too many service members are returning home with unmet mental health needs     stresses that are often experienced by their family members   That   s why our amendment provides  17 million for more mental health crisis counselors   While we all praise how our country treated the service members returning from World War II  we must remember the lessons after Vietnam   The landmark National Vietnam Veterans    Readjustment Study was congressionally mandated in 1983  fifteen years after the height of that war   The completed report showed that the vast majority of Vietnam veterans had successfully acclimated to post war life   We can   t wait fifteen years to plan and prepare for the readjustment needs of the service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan   The average age of a service member deployed since September 11th is 27   The average age of our Guard and Reservists is 33   Sixty percent of those deployed have family responsibilities     47 percent of those who have died have left families   160 000 women have been deployed  and ten percent of those women are single mothers   These men and women are going to face real challenges in readjusting to normal life   Our amendment would provide for a study by the National Academy of Sciences of the mental health and readjustment needs of returning service members   This study will assist the Department of Defense  VA  and Congress in planning for the long term needs of our veterans  Mr  President  last week  I met a woman at Walter Reed   She is one of the 160 000 women who have been deployed  and she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder   Most of us associate PTSD with men and combat   But many of the women in theater face first hand dangers in their combat support roles   Driving a truck in Baghdad is one of the most dangerous missions around     and that is a support role   Women are witnessing the horrors of improvised explosive devices and the horrors of losing fellow service members   And too many experience the trauma of sexual abuse   This young woman was very scared and she trembled as we spoke   I asked what we could do to help   She said that she could not handle group therapy sessions  she could only tolerate one on one sessions with counselors   Her experience is shared by many women   Treatment for women with PTSD  especially sexual abuse victims  is very different from treatment for men   That is why today  we want to provide  15 million to address the unique mental health needs of women   This funding will ensure the development and implementation of a women   s treatment program for mental health conditions  including PTSD   It will also include the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors  so that the service members who suffer from this trauma do not have to suffer in silence   We can do this for the woman I met at Walter Reed and the thousands who suffer like her   The total cost of our amendment is  103 million     less than one tenth of one percent the total cost of this bill   That   s the least we can do for our service members and their families                                   ,1

1810,"GAO: UNCLE SAM FAVORS BANKS OVER CREDIT UNIONS
  Despite years of complaints by the banking and savings and loan industries that tax-exempt credit unions have an unfair competitive advantage, a new Government Accountability Office study shows banks continued to dominate.  
   The report, conducted at the request of Senator Bernie Sanders, found that bank profits have grown by more than double the rate of net income at credit unions. Moreover, 31 percent of banks and thrifts are now organized to avoid corporate taxation.
   The report found that banks received $108 billion in tax deductions and $200 million in tax credits in 2004 alone. By comparison, the Treasury Department has estimated that the value of the tax-exempt status for credit unions will total only $1.4 billion this year.
   ""This study provides conclusive evidence that all the moaning and groaning by the big banks about unfair competition from credit unions is unfounded. The big banks' profits are going up and up, as is the compensation of their CEOs, while credit unions have remained focused on providing financial assistance to middle-class and working families. The benefit that Americans get from credit unions outweighs by far the cost of the credit unions' tax-exempt status,"" said Sanders, who requested the study last July.
   The independent investigative arm of Congress also found that:
   * Thirty-one percent of all banks paid no corporate income taxes at all by becoming Subchapter S corporations.
   * In 2006, banks and thrifts received $146 billion in profits compared to a mere $6 billion in retained earnings for the entire credit union industry.
   * Compared to the previous ten years, banks and thrifts experienced double the earnings growth rate of credit unions in 2006 after adjusting for inflation.
   * Some banks, like BB&T, have evaded millions of dollars in U.S. taxes by setting-up illegal tax shelters.
   * From 1992-2000, average direct compensation for bank CEOs more than doubled, according to a recent report.
   * The cost to American taxpayers for bailing out the Savings and Loan Industry in the 1980s has grown to more than $200 billion in today's dollars.
   ""Instead of questioning the tax-exempt status of credit unions, which have helped millions of members with lower fees, reduced interest rates, and better service, the American public would be much better served if Congress took a serious look at the escalating fees, economic concentration, and CEO compensation packages that big banks are receiving,"" Sanders said.
   ""As documented by the GAO, big banks are right about one thing: there is not a level playing field, but the big banks seem to have the advantage. I hope that Congress will listen to the evidence in this report and finally ignore the pleas of big banks to undermine credit unions.""

1763,"STOP THE WAR
  The Senate received a House-passed bill that includes $50 billion of the nearly $200 billion that President Bush wants for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It would require troop withdrawals to begin within 30 days, and sets a goal of complete withdrawal by mid-December 2008. The bill awaiting a Senate vote also would require C.I.A. operatives and other American personnel to follow Army Field Manual rules on torture, including ban on waterboarding, an interrogation technique that simulates drowning. Bush, of course, has threatened a veto. ""The war in Iraq has cost us over 3,800 dead and 28,000 wounded. While the president is vetoing bills because he thinks we don't have enough money for health care or education, there are estimates that this war will end up costing us over $1 trillion. Legislation will be coming to the floor to provide enough funds to redeploy our troops out of Iraq within the next year. I will support that bill and hope that the President reconsiders his veto threat.""

                    WASHINGTON  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Patty Murray today launched a petition to press the Food and Drug Administration to make a yes or no decision on the pending application for over the counter status of Plan B based on science  not ideology   Senators Clinton and Murray unveiled the letter they will submit to the FDA in response to the agency  s request for public comment on the Plan B application and urged those who support their call to sign on to the letter  posted on their websites          The FDA has been dragging its heels for two years on the Plan B application and the American people deserve a decision  yes or no   The continued delays are damaging the reputation of the FDA and putting women s health at risk   We urge you to take an important step toward restoring the credibility of the FDA by making a decision expeditiously and based strictly on scientific evidence     said Senators Clinton and Murray        On August 26  the FDA announced a new public comment period on the application to make Plan B emergency contraception available over the counter   This action amounts to an indefinite delay in consideration of the application and flies in the face of the mounting scientific and medical evidence that emergency contraception is a safe  effective method for reducing the rate of unintended pregnancy        Click here for a link to the petition  http   clinton senate gov issues women index cfm topic planbpetition       The text of the letter Senators Clinton and Murray will submit to the FDA follows          Andrew C  von Eschenbach  MD   Acting Commissioner  Food and Drug Administration       5600 Fishers Lane       Rockville  MD 20857 0002         Dear Dr  von Eschenbach        We write in response to your request for comments on the pending application to make Plan B available over the counter         As an initial matter  we are disturbed that this application has been subjected to scrutiny that far exceeds the normal FDA procedures  It is virtually unprecedented for an over the counter application to be subjected to more than two years of inaction  only to be then subjected to an extended public comment period with no timetable for a decision  This entire process  and particularly the decision to initiate rule making at this late state in the process of considering an application is a troubling precedent for an agency charged with making decisions rooted in scientific and legal grounds        As you know  the available scientific data indicate that emergency contraception  EC  helps prevent thousands of unintended pregnancies every year  without increasing the rates of unprotected sex  The FDA approved EC for the express purpose of preventing pregnancy  and the Guttmacher Institute estimated that in 2000 alone  use of EC prevented more than 50 000 abortions  Since that time  sales of EC have grown dramatically and researchers estimate that if made available over the counter  emergency contraception could prevent as many as half of the 3 million unintended pregnancies in the U S  annually         More than 70 organizations  including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics  have voiced their support for making Plan B available over the counter  A May 2004 statement by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called your agency s failure to approve this application  despite the nearly unanimous recommendation of its own advisory panels  morally repugnant  and  a tragedy for American women   Just recently  the widely respected Assistant Commissioner for Women s Health and Director of the Office of Women  s Health at the FDA  Dr  Susan Wood  resigned in protest  stating that she has  spent the last 15 years working to ensure that science informs good health policy decisions  and  can no longer serve as staff when scientific and clinical evidence  fully evaluated and recommended for approval by the professional staff here  has been overruled          In your request for public comment  you cited particular concerns about access to emergency contraception for young girls  This act was a major deviation from the FDA  s normal standards for evaluating the safety and efficacy of reproductive health products  which have treated all women of child bearing age the same  It appears the FDA is changing the rules midstream  Furthermore  according to press reports  high ranking FDA scientists including Dr  John Jenkins  director of FDA s Office of New Drugs  wrote internal memos stating that Plan B did not pose any particular risks for younger women and that the agency was subjecting the application to more rigorous examination than applications for other drugs  Dr  Jenkins said Barr s application was  fully consistent with the agency s usual standards for meeting the criteria  for OTC status         In any case  several products available for sale in our society are already restricted by age  Retailers are prohibited from selling alcohol and tobacco products  including Nicorette  the FDA approved gum aimed at reducing nicotine addiction  to minors  Many retail chains  such as Wal Mart  Best Buy and Target  have already policies for verifying the age of purchasers as a means of enforcing these restrictions  Surely pharmacies  if they do not already  could follow suit        Furthermore  the FDA has had more than a year to develop a strategy for overcoming complications that could arise from selling a product with age restrictions  Instead you have opted for inaction  waiting until the last conceivable moment  seven months past the agency s own deadline  to announce yet another cause for delay         The fact is that not one reputable medical or scientific organization and few  if any  of the scientists within the FDA s own ranks support the decisions of the agency you head on this matter  The continued delays are damaging the reputation of the entire FDA and putting women s health at risk         We urge you to expeditiously make a decision on the application for OTC status for Plan B based strictly on scientific evidence          Sincerely        Senator Clinton          Senator Murray         ,0

equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our national defense and the Rochester regions economy  I will continue to firmly push this bill through the appropriations process    This is wonderful news for the Greater Rochester region  As these local companies and institutions continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  This is an important investment in the Greater Rochester region for many reasons  not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  I look forward to the bills approval by the full Senate  Senator Clinton said   Delphi  Accelerating Fuel Cells Manufacturability    3 Million Funding will help to accelerate the application of fuel cells for a wide range of DoD electrical power needs  including  but not limited to  ships and submarines  soldier power  ground vehicles  mobile electric power for bases and other field equipment  and aircraft   In particular  this project will enable the DoD to advance fuel cell manufacturing feasibility and readiness for field testing   Infotonics Research Center  Infotonics Research    3 Million The National Center for Infotonics is a collaboration between New York State research universities and the photonics industry to accelerate research and technology commercialization and transfer and industry development in photonics and micro systems   Dozens of companies involved in photonics and micro systems are working with a number of research universities in New York State to develop a comprehensive approach to solving problems facing the photonics and micro systems industries and make them more competitive internationally   Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems   Funding will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies   Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications     RIT  Defense Modernization and Sustainment Initiative    2 Million Funding will be used to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems   The Department of Defense  while developing new systems that will enable major advances in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems   The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems   This research program provides DoD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles   Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems   For example  one project  out of several that are ongoing as part of this research program  to improve the maintenance and extend the life of the militarys fleet of Light Armored Vehicles  LAVs  is projected to reduce maintenance costs by  2 1 million per year  and  42 million over the life cycle of the platform   In addition  this work will allow the service life of the current fleet to be extended by 20 25 years   These vehicles were originally scheduled for retirement in 2003   General Motors  Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion    2 Million For FY 08  the initiative proposes to demonstrate a commercially based front wheel drive SUV style hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with significantly improved capabilities and performance as compared with earlier vehicles  The lessons learned in this ongoing initiative will bring hydrogen fuel cell vehicles an important step closer to deployment in U S  Army non tactical fleets   General Motors  Future Fuel Non Tactical Vehicle Initiative    2 Million In FY05 and FY06  successful 6 month long demonstrations of a hydrogen fuel cell pick up truck and SUV were completed operating at the USMC installation at Camp Pendleton  CA   It is proposed that the U S  Navy USMC build upon the aforementioned short term demonstrations with an expanded demonstration of  3  Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell vehicles at the USMC installation at Camp Pendleton and an extended vehicle range refueling capability enhancement of the U S  Navy installed hydrogen refueling site at Camp Pendleton         ,0

                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Senate Budget Committee to restore the Bush Administration s proposed cuts to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    Last month  President Bush sharply reduced LIHEAP funding in his FY  06 budget with New York losing more than  28 million from last year s funding  These federal dollars are a lifeline for low income families and elderly citizens in New York who are struggling to pay sky rocketing heating bills this winter    In a bipartisan letter sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  the Senator called for the restoration of the much needed funds  along with a provision to make them available earlier than usual  to enable states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer     These proposed cuts could not have come at a worse time  The storms that have blasted the region over the past few days are another bitter reminder to so many New Yorkers of the need for heating assistance   Senator Clinton said      If the President s Budget cuts are not restored  many low income New Yorkers will be left out in the cold   Senator Clinton said   On behalf of all the thousands of low income New Yorkers who could benefit from these federal dollars  I urge my colleagues to reverse the ill conceived cuts to this vital program     The President s fiscal 2006 budget proposes  1 8 billion in Fiscal Year 2006  for the regular LIHEAP program and  200 million for contingency funding   For Fiscal Year 2005  LIHEAP received  1 88 billion in regular funding and  297 6 million in contingency funding   The President s Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposes an  80 million  4 3 percent  decrease in regular funding and a  97 6 million  32 8 percent  decrease in contingency funding   This will mean a reduction in funding to New York of  11 million in regular funding  and using recent emergency funding allocations  a cut of nearly  17 million in emergency funding       A copy of the Senators  letter is attached    March 1  2005   The Honorable Judd Gregg     Chairman       Committee on the Budget    United States Senate     Washington  DC 20510        The Honorable Kent Conrad   Ranking Member    United States Senate     Washington  DC 20510    Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad    The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  provides a vital safety net for our nation s low income households   LIHEAP helps low income families and seniors remain healthy and secure from bitter cold winters in the North and hot summers in the South   We are writing to request that the budget provide  3 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2006 and that the allocation provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2007   With  3 billion in regular funding and advance appropriations  LIHEAP can help working low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain economic stability    For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable   These families often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans    spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills   Each year  this burden grows as natural gas  heating oil and propane prices continue to increase       Since 1981  the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has grown   This winter  LIHEAP will serve an estimated 5 million households   Yet  this is only about 15 percent of the 32 million households that are eligible for federal assistance   We recognize the difficult choices that you face in shaping the fiscal 2006 budget resolution  however  we believe that the continued growth in households eligible for LIHEAP assistance demonstrates that the need for this program has never been greater   The LIHEAP program remains seriously underfunded   The program needs at least  3 billion simply to equal the purchasing power it provided in 1982     Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing and food   The Boston Medical Center found that many poor children with chronic health conditions start to lose weight and suffer additional health problems associated with malnutrition in the winter because their families are spending less of their income on food and medicine and more on fuel bills   The National Energy Assistance Directors Association surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by households when faced with high energy bills   The survey found that in the last five years         38 percent of LIHEAP recipients went without medical or dental care        30 percent went without filling a prescription or taking the full dose of a prescribed medicine        28 percent did not make a rent or mortgage payment        22 percent went without food for at least one day  and       21 percent became sick because their home was too cold      We also request advance funding for LIHEAP   Advance funding enables states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer   Advance LIHEAP funding allows states to plan more efficiently and improve program management  and therefore  be more economical with limited Federal resources    It also ensures that states provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot

1971,"VERMONT CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION OBJECTS TO GENERAL PETRAEUS' CALL FOR OPEN-ENDED U.S. ROLE IN IRAQ
  The members of Vermont's Congressional Delegation - U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and U.S. Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) - Tuesday renewed their support for withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq and disagreed with Gen. David Petraeus' call for freezing troop levels in Iraq and for keeping the door open to U.S. involvement in the Iraq conflict for the foreseeable future. 
   General Petraeus is testifying this week before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees about the troop surge and about the recent increase in U.S. casualties in Iraq.
   Leahy said, ""The reality in Iraq is that the troop escalation called the surge has failed to achieve its central goal. Iraq remains riven by ethnic, religious, and tribal differences, and the myriad of groups have made only limited and halting steps toward reconciling their differences. Violence is again on the upswing, and the recently failed Basra offensive has emboldened militant groups while revealing the deep weaknesses of the fledgling Iraq military. Every day more American servicemen and women are killed or grievously wounded, with no end in sight to our involvement there. A deadline for the beginning of the orderly and swift redeployment of American forces, combined with effective diplomacy, would end Iraqi dependence on the United States and force some type of peace agreement.""
   Sanders said, ""The war in Iraq has been a disaster in terms of the number of dead and wounded, the loss of focus on al Qaeda and Afghanistan, and the cost that eventually will exceed $1 trillion. It is unacceptable that we have an administration that refuses to tell us how many more years we will be in Iraq or how many billions of dollars will be added to the national debt. The United States has a moral obligation to support the Iraqi government and military, but we must bring our troops home as soon as possible.""
   Welch said, ""We need a change of direction in Iraq. Unfortunately, all President Bush is offering is more of the same military policy that has yet to produce the political progress to sustain a functioning Iraqi democracy. This war has cost our troops and their families, our national security, and American taxpayers gravely. Now, in the sixth year of this unjust and unnecessary war, 150,000 of our men and women remain deployed in an extremely dangerous environment, while the Maliki government is fighting its political rivals rather than negotiating a sustainable peace. General Petraeus and President Bush have yet to provide the American people with a strategy to achieve the political reconciliation necessary to bring this horrible war to an end.""

                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Measure Now Included in Comprehensive Energy Bill

                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  announced that the Senate has approved a green job training proposal she introduced with Senator Bernie Sanders  I VT    The measure authorizes new programs to train workers for green collar jobs that involve the design  manufacturing  installation  operation  and maintenance of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies   The amendment is now part of the comprehensive energy bill currently being debated by the Senate     To attack global warming  we need to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy  said Senator Clinton   Deploying these technologies is a win win that will reduce pollution and create new  good paying jobs   This important legislation will help to train workers to meet the needs of the growing clean energy sectors of our economy    One way to slow global warming is to use energy in a smarter way  An effective and economical way to cut consumption is to make homes and businesses more energy efficient   Trouble is  today you would have a hard time finding workers qualified to do the job  Senator Sanders said   If were smart  we can help people make their homes and offices more energy efficient and in the process create millions of good paying green jobs    The Sanders Clinton Amendment would establish an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Workforce Training Program to be administered by the Department of Labor in coordination with the Department of Energy   The amendment addresses emerging workforce shortages that could stymie growth of the renewable energy and efficiency industries   A 2006 study from the National Renewable Energy Lab  NREL  identified the shortage of skills and training as a leading non technical barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth   In particular  the NREL study identified a number of critical unmet training needs  including lack of reliable installation  maintenance  and inspection services  the shortage of key technical and manufacturing skills  and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies   The program established by the Sanders Clinton amendment would target individuals including veterans  workers displaced by economic globalization  workers seeking pathways out of poverty and into economic self sufficiency  and individuals in need of updated training   Industries eligible for training services under the program include  energy efficient building  construction  and retrofits  renewable electric power  advanced automotive drive trains  bio fuels  and the deconstruction and materials use industries       The Sanders Clinton amendment would authorize up to  40 million per year in grants on a competitive basis under a National Training Partnerships program and up to  40 million per year in grants to states to implement labor exchange and training programs  Preference would be given to states that show leadership in promoting renewable energy  energy efficiency  and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions   Eligible entities would include non profit organizations that are composed of partnerships between industry and labor  taking advantage of established programs in order to ensure the highest quality training possible   The funding would be sufficient to train between 20 000 and 30 000 workers per year   The Sanders Clinton amendment also provides up to  20 million per year for national and state industry wide research  labor market information  and labor exchange programs      As Congress advances programs to enhance our energy security and address global warming  workforce shortages are emerging in the utilities sector that could stymie growth of the renewable energy and efficiency industries  Apollo Alliance President Jerome Ringo said  According to the American Public Power Association  half of current utility workers will retire within the next decade   However  our nation is not training enough new workers to fill their places    The amendment is supported by a diverse array of renewable energy  labor  trade  environmental  and other groups  Apollo Alliance  Renewable Fuels

                     WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Barbara Boxer  D CA  today unveiled comprehensive voting reform legislation to make sure that every American is able to vote and every vote is counted  Senators Clinton and Boxer announced the legislation today in a press conference joined by Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones  D OH   who will sponsor the legislation in the House of Representatives  and voting rights advocates          Voting is the most precious right of every citizen  and we have a moral obligation to ensure the integrity of our voting process   said Senator Clinton   The smooth functioning of our democracy depends on voters having faith in the fairness and accuracy of our voting system  and the Count Every Vote Act is an important step toward restoring this covenant  We must be able to easily and accurately count every vote so that every vote counts          Added Senator Boxer   Every citizen of this country should be guaranteed that their vote matters  that their vote is counted  and that in the voting booth  their vote has a much weight as that of any CEO  any member of Congress  or any President  Our democracy is the centerpiece of who we are as a nation  and we must take action to ensure that the American people have full confidence in our electoral system          I am pleased to join with Senators Clinton and Boxer in introducing companion legislation in the House as we continue our efforts to ensure that every American is afforded their Constitutional right to vote   said Representative Tubbs Jones   This legislation seeks to combat the tremendous voting irregularities that plagued both the 2000 and 2004 elections  If in fact we see it is our obligation to secure democracy around the world  to monitor and oversee free and fair elections in other countries  most recently in Iraq  then we must ensure  protect and guarantee the right to vote right here at home         The Count Every Vote Act of 2005 will provide a voter verified paper ballot for every vote cast in electronic voting machines and ensures access to voter verification for all citizens  including language minority voters  illiterate voters and voters with disabilities  The bill mandates that this ballot be the official ballot for purposes of a recount  The bill sets a uniform standard for provisional ballots so that every qualified voter will know their votes are treated equally  and requires the Federal Election Assistance Commission to issue standards that ensure uniform access to voting machines and trained election personnel in every community  The bill also improves security measures for electronic voting machines         To encourage more citizens to exercise their right to vote  the Count Every Vote Act designates Election Day a federal holiday and requires early voting in each state  The bill also enacts  no excuse  absentee balloting  enacts fair and uniform voter registration and identification  and requires states to allow citizens to register to vote on Election Day  It also requires the Election Assistance Commission to work with states to reduce wait times for voters at polling places  In addition  the legislation restores voting rights for felons who have repaid their debt to society         The Count Every Vote Act also includes measures to protect voters from deceptive practices and conflicts of interest that harm voter trust in the integrity of the system  In particular  the bill restricts the ability of chief state election officials as well as owners and senior managers of voting machine manufacturers to engage in certain kinds of political activity  The bill also makes it a federal crime to commit deceptive practices  such as sending flyers into minority neighborhoods telling voters the wrong voting date  and makes these practices a felony punishable by up to a year of imprisonment        Today  representatives from civil rights organizations and voting rights advocates praised the legislation  including People For the American Way  Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law  NAACP  Common Cause  the National Voting Rights Institute  DEMOS and the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium  The leaders emphasized the urgent need for the bill          Every American citizen should be able to cast a vote that counts  and it should not be difficult   said Ralph G  Neas  President of People For the American Way  one of the founding members of the Election Protection coalition   This bill provides practical  secure accessible solutions at the ballot box for Americans with disabilities  those who speak languages other than English  and other Americans who face hurdles in exercising their voting rights  It s a great bill           The Count Every Vote Act will go a long way toward restoring dignity to our nation s electoral system and will provide citizens across the nation with an opportunity to effectively participate in democratic decision making   said Barbara R  Arnwine  Executive Director of the Lawyers  Committee        Senators Clinton and Boxer first introduced election reform legislation in the 108th Congress  together with former Senator Bob Graham  In the meantime  another election cycle showed evidence of problems in the Federal election system  including long wait times to vote  erroneous purging of voters  voter suppression and intimidation and unequal access to the voting process  The Count Every Vote Act requires that all provisions be in place for the next major election cycle in 2006          We cannot let another Election Day go by without doing everything we can to make sure that voters have confidence in our voting system and exercise their right to vote   underscored Senator Clinton   This shouldn t be a Republican or Democratic issue  This is a voter issue  plain and simple  I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with us to implement these common sense measures         Senators Clinton and Boxer and Representative Tubbs Jones will work in the 109th Congress to keep attention to this issue and urge action

1767,"SEN. SANDERS APPLAUDS DEPARTMENT OF LABOR DECISION TO AWARD FEDERAL BENEFITS TO SPECIALTY FILAMENTS WORKERS
  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced today that the former employees of Specialty Filaments in Middlebury who have not been rehired by current management are now eligible to apply for federal Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA).  
   Last January, more than 170 employees at Specialty Filaments lost their jobs when the company applied for bankruptcy due to competition with cheap Chinese imports. Earlier this month, the Thomas Monahan Company purchased Specialty Filaments and agreed to rehire many of the Specialty Filaments employees. 
   Sanders said, ""The very good news is that most workers at Specialty Filaments won't need this Trade Adjustment Assistance because they will continue to be employed with the new owners of the facility, the Thomas Monahan Company. Fortunately, those who are not rehired will be provided important federal assistance as they look for new job opportunities."" 
   TAA assistance is only approved when the federal government finds that the jobs were moved overseas. TAA benefits include extended unemployment payments of up to 78 weeks; up to two years of job training, career counseling assistance, job placement, and relocation assistance. Older workers, for whom retraining may not be appropriate, will also be able to accept alternative benefits more appropriate for their circumstances.

259,   Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu Tuesday  October 18  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  October 18  2005  Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu  Remarks as prepared for delivery on the U S  Senate floor  Washington  DC  October 18  2005   Mr  President    We are continuing to witness the relentless spread of avian flu  carried slowly but predictably by wild  migratory birds from countries in Southeast Asia to Western China  to Mongolia  and then over the Ural Mountains into Russia and Ukraine   From there  avian flu has spread over the past week to Romania and Turkey  and we have just learned  possibly into Greece    Dr  Joseph Domenech  chief of the Animal Health Service at the United Nation s Food and Agriculture Organization  has been quoted as saying that     we are not surprised     Mr  President  at this point  no one should be surprised   The experts have told us repeatedly that a flu pandemic is inevitable  although the timing is unpredictable   In other words  the question is not if  but when  This spread of avian flu is our warning signal  and we need to heed this call to action       If we re lucky  we ll have at least a year  or perhaps several years  to prepare for a flu pandemic   But we might not be so lucky   And regardless of whether it is this particular strain of avian flu  H5N1  or another deadly strain  the time to act is long overdue if we want to prevent unprecedented human suffering  death  and economic devastation    International health experts say that two of the three conditions for an avian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia already exist    First  a new strain of the virus has emerged to which humans have little or no immunity   Second  this strain has shown that it can jump between species    The last condition  the ability for the virus to travel efficiently from human to human  has not been met  and it is the only thing preventing a full blown pandemic    Once this virus mutates and can be transmitted from human to human  we will not be able to contain this disease   Because of the wonders of modern travel  a person could board a plane in Bangkok  Athens  or Bucharest and land in Chicago less than a day later  unknowingly carrying the virus   Indeed  we learned this lesson from SARS  which moved quickly from Asia to Canada  where it led to many deaths    As my colleagues know  one of my top priorities since arriving in the Senate has been increasing awareness about the avian flu   In April of this year  I introduced the AVIAN Act  which is a comprehensive bill to increase our preparedness for an avian flu pandemic   This bill was incorporated into a larger bill  the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act  that Senator Reid and I introduced two weeks ago   We need to move this bill as quickly as possible    We also need to provide more funding to purchase vaccines and antivirals and improve our ability to spot and isolate a pandemic as soon as it begins   In the spring and summer  I worked to secure  35 million in funding to fight the avian flu   Today  some of this money is already helping the World Health Organization to step up its international surveillance and response efforts    But clearly much more money is needed   Last month  I joined Senator Harkin and others in offering an amendment to the DOD appropriations bill to provide almost  4 billion to fight the avian flu   I am pleased that Senator Stevens cosponsored the amendment and it was accepted into the appropriations bill   I hope that the House will agree to this funding in conference     Although we have begun to step up to the plate in the Senate  it is unfortunate that none of the avian flu bills that have been introduced have passed into law   Frankly  there s been a lot of talk  but not enough action   And this isn t just true of the Congress    One year after publishing the draft pandemic flu plan  the Administration has still not released the final HHS Pandemic Flu Preparedness Plan   Half of states haven t published plans either  and we know that many of these states will need substantial help    This lack of planning is compounded by the fact that we still don t have a FDA approved vaccine against avian flu  and the one drug that many countries are relying on  Tamiflu  may be less effective than experts had thought     The manufacturer is also struggling to meet the demand  and it could take up to 2 years for it to make enough for the U S  stockpile  presuming this Administration finally puts in an order for the drug    I would ask my colleagues how many hearings and briefings that they have sat through where witnesses and experts have urged the United States government to be better prepared for these types of crises     The failure to prepare for emergencies can have devastating consequences   We learned that lesson the hard way after Hurricane Katrina   This nation must not be caught off guard when faced with the prospect of an avian flu pandemic   The consequences are too high    The flyways for migratory birds are well established   We know that avian flu will likely hit the United States in a matter of time   With the regular flu season coming up shortly  conditions will be favorable for reassortment of the avian flu virus with the annual flu virus   Such reassortment could lead to a mutated virus that could be transmitted efficiently between humans  which is the last condition needed for pandemic flu    The question is will we be ready when that happens   Let s make sure that answer is yes   I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to push this Administration to take the action needed to prevent a catastrophe that we have not seen during our lifetimes    Thank you   I yield the floor                                   ,1

1709,"SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS IN HEALTH CARE
  The Senate this week is considering a bill, cosponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, that would expand and encourage federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research. President Bush in 2001 cut off federal funding for research involving new embryonic stem cells, which has dramatically stalled this critical area of medical research.  
   ""My hope is that, as a result of increased pressure from scientists, physicians and the American people, the president will change his position or, if he does not, that the Congress will have enough votes to override his veto and establish unrestricted federal funding for stem cell research,"" Sanders said. ""The potential is now available for major breakthroughs in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, spinal cord injury, stroke, heart disease and many other illnesses. We must seize the opportunity.""

388,   Obama  Comprehensive Immigration Reform Should be Tough  Respect Nation   s Values   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Comprehensive Immigration Reform Should be Tough  Respect Nation   s Values Wednesday  May 23  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt   WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today spoke on the Senate floor about comprehensive immigration reform  saying comprehensive and bipartisan immigration reform is necessary and should strengthen our security  promote our economic interests  and reaffirm our heritage as a nation of immigrants   Obama announced plans to introduce an amendment with Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  that would remove that arbitrary minimum threshold of points before family preference is considered and increase the points for family ties   Under the current agreement  an applicant would have to obtain 55 points through other criteria before receiving points for family ties   He said he intends to introduce a second amendment with Senator Menendez that would sunset the immigration point system in five years and call on Congress to examine the consequences of the program and determine whether it should continue   Senator Obama   s floor statement is below       Last year  I spoke at one of the marches in Chicago for comprehensive immigration reform   I looked out across the faces in the crowd  I saw mothers and fathers  citizens and immigrants  people of Polish and Mexican descent  working Americans  and children          And what I know is that these are people we should embrace  not fear   We can and should be able to see ourselves in them          I do not say that to diminish the complexity of the task   I say it because I believe it must guide our discourse   We can and should be able to fix our broken immigration system   I think the bill that has come to the floor is a fine first step  but it still requires some changes  and I am working with others to improve it           In approaching immigration reform  I believe that we must enact tough  practical reforms that ensure and promote the legal and orderly entry of immigrants into our country   Just as important  we must respect the humanity of the carpenters and bricklayers who help build America  the humanity of garment workers and farm workers who come to America to join their families  the humanity of the students like my father who come to America in search of the dream   We are a nation of immigrants  and we must respect that shared history as this debate moves forward          To fix the system in a way that does not require us to revisit the same problem in twenty years  I continue to believe that we need stronger enforcement on the border and at the workplace   And that means a workable mandatory system that employers must use to verify the legality of their workers          But for reform to work  we also must respond to what pulls people to America and what pushes them out of their home countries   Where we can reunite families  we should   Where we can bring in more foreign born workers with the skills our economy needs  we should   And these goals are not mutually exclusive   We should not say that Spanish speaking or working class immigrants are only good enough to be temporary workers and cannot earn the right to be part of the American family          With regard to the most pressing part of the immigration challenge     the 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the U S      we must create an earned path to citizenship   Now  no one condones unauthorized entry into the United States   And by supporting an earned path to citizenship  I am not saying that illegal entry should go unpunished   The path to permanent residence and eventual citizenship must be tough enough to make it clear that unauthorized entry was wrong          But these immigrants are our neighbors   They go to our churches  and their kids go to our schools   They provide the hard labor that supports many of the industries in our country   We should bring them out of hiding  make them pay the appropriate fines for their mistakes  and then help them become tax paying  law abiding  productive members of society          I am heartened by the agreement that we have to put all 12 million undocumented immigrants on a path to earned citizenship   But there are other parts of the compromise deal before us that cause me serious concern           Let me briefly address some of those concerns          In order to stem the demand for illegal workers  we need a mandatory employment verification system that is actually mandatory   It needs to allow employers to check with the Department of Homeland Security to see that their employees are legally eligible to work in the United States   This is something I worked on last year   But this year   s version of the employment eligibility verification system would give DHS too much power to force the screening of everyone working in America without appropriate safeguards   I will be working with others to offer an amendment to make this provision closer to what we proposed last year          As for the guestworker program in the bill  it proposes to create a new 400 000 person annual temporary worker program that could grow to 600 000 without Congressional approval   And it expands the existing seasonal guestworker programs from 66 000 up to 100 000 in the first year and 200 000 after that   At the end of their temporary status  almost all of these workers would have to go home   That means at the end of the first three years  we would have at least 1 2 million of these new guestworkers in the country with only 30 000 of those having any real hope of getting to stay   That will just create a new undocumented immigrant population          As we have learned with misguided immigration policies in the past  it is na  ve to think that people who do not have a way to stay legally will just abide by the system and leave   They won   t   This new group of second class workers will replace the current group of undocumented immigrants  placing downward pressure on American wages and working conditions   And when their time is up  they will go into the shadows where our current system exploits the undocumented today         I will support amendments aimed at fixing the temporary worker program that Senator Bingaman and others will be offering   And if we   re going to have a new temporary worker program  those workers should have an opportunity to stay if they prove themselves capable          But the most disturbing aspect of this bill is the point system for future immigrants   As currently drafted  it does not reflect how much Americans value the family ties that bind people to their brothers and sisters or to their parents          As I understand it  a similar point system is used in Australia and Canada and is intended to attract immigrants who can help produce more goods   But we need to consider more than economics  we also need to consider our nation s unique history and values and what family based preferences are designed to accomplish   As currently structured  the points system gives no preference to an immigrant with a brother or sister or even a parent who is a United States citizen unless the immigrant meets some minimum and arbitrary threshold on education and skills          That   s wrong and fails to recognize the fundamental morality of uniting Americans with their family members   It also places a person   s job skills over his character and work ethic   How many of our forefathers would have measured up under this point system   How many would have been turned back at Ellis Island          I have cosponsored an amendment with Senator Menendez to remove that arbitrary minimum threshold of points before family starts to count and to bump up the points for family ties          And at the appropriate time  I will be offering another amendment with Senator Menendez  to sunset the points system in the bill   The proposed point system constitutes  at a minimum  a radical experiment in social engineering and a departure from our tradition of having family and employers invite immigrants to come   If we are going to allow this to go forward  then Congress should revisit the point system in five years to give us time to examine the concept in depth and determine whether its intended or unintended consequences are worth the cost of continuing the experiment or whether we should return to the existing system that allows immigrants to be sponsored through family and employers          In closing  we must construct a final product that has broad bipartisan support and will work   The time to fix our broken immigration system is now   If we do not fix it this year  I fear that divisions over the issue will only deepen and the challenge will grow                                      ,1

                                          Senators Concerned Service Members Suffering from Mental Illness are Not Receiving Impartial Reviews Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              Contact  Natalie Ravitz  Boxer   Shana Marchio  Bond   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or Liz Richardson  Kerry   Case of Lt  Whiteside illustrates the need to review DoD policy Washington  D C    U S  Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Barack Obama   D IL  and John Kerry  D MA  today sent the following letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates    December 14  2007 The Honorable Robert Gates   Secretary of Defense   1000 Defense Pentagon   Washington  DC 20301  Dear Secretary Gates   We are concerned over reports that members of our Armed Forces with underlying mental health conditions are not receiving balanced  fair  and impartial reviews when facing judicial punishment and administrative discharge for engaging in misconduct that could be related to their conditions   We understand and support the necessity of maintaining good order and discipline in the military  At the same time  we are concerned that the decision to prosecute a service member with serious mental health issues may  in some cases  be carried out without appropriate consideration of recommendations made by uniformed mental health providers  As such  we ask you to promptly review guidelines for the administrative handling of such complex cases    On December 2  2007  The Washington Post ran a story entitled    A Soldier   s Officer    that clearly illustrates our concerns  The piece details the ordeal of Army First Lieutenant Elizabeth Whiteside  who according to available reports  served honorably at both Water Reed Army Medical Center  WRAMC  and in Iraq before experiencing severe mental health symptoms and attempting suicide  During her apparent suicide attempt  Lt  Whiteside threatened a number of her fellow service members  and as a result  we understand the Army is currently deciding whether to pursue a court martial against her    What we find particularly troubling about this case is that military commanders with no medical training derided the documented medical opinions as to Lt  Whiteside   s mental condition and their bearing on the case  Colonel Terrence J  McKenrick  commander of the Warrior Transition Brigade at Walter Reed  charged that even though medical professionals had determined Lt  Whiteside had a    severe mental disease or defect  she knowingly assaulted and threatened others and injured herself     Another commander wrote that Lt  Whiteside   s    defense that she suffers from a mental disease excusing her actions is just that   an excuse  an excuse to distract from choices and decisions made by Lt  Whiteside     These statements are contrary to the apparent recommendations of Lt  Whiteside   s battalion commander in Iraq that disciplinary actions not be taken  and show a callous disregard for the diagnosis of qualified psychiatrists at WRAMC  who found that Lt  Whiteside suffered from a    severe major depressive disorder and a personality disorder    and    disassociation with reality      We believe that service members should be held accountable for their actions  and we recognize that the Manual for Courts Martial provides procedures for handling mental health issues in judicial proceedings  However  this case highlights the need for the Department to review its administrative procedures and training programs to ensure that commanders give full and fair consideration of the recommendations made by trained mental health providers before initiating disciplinary actions against soldiers suffering from mental diseases   Additionally  as Senators who have worked extensively to improve mental health care services for our armed forces  we find it unacceptable that officers with no medical training   who are required by law to protect the impartiality of the military justice process   would make dismissive statements regarding Lt  Whiteside   s mental health condition  These comments only undermine respect for the mental health profession and increase the stigma associated with seeking mental health care   According to the Congressionally mandated report of the Department of Defense Task Force on Mental Health     every military leader bears responsibility for addressing stigma  leaders who fail to do so reduce the effectiveness of the service members they lead     The Department is best served by ending policies that discriminate against service members who suffer from mental health problems and working to eliminate the stigma that prevents too many from seeking care  That is why we strongly urge you to ensure that the recommendations of qualified medical professionals play a clearly defined and important role in proceedings to discharge or punish any service member with an underlying mental health condition    Thank you for your consideration of this important request     Sincerely    Barbara Boxer                                             United States Senator                                    Christopher S  Bond  United States Senator

Illinois Thursday  April  3  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT  Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 Obama cosponsored legislation in 2005 to restore grant funding WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  joined a bipartisan coalition of senators in calling on the Senate Appropriations Committee to fully fund the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  Byrne JAG  Program in this year s Supplemental Appropriations bill   For more than two decades  the Byrne JAG program has provided funding each year for nearly 4 000 state and local law enforcement officials to help make communities safer and improve criminal justice programs    Last year  the Senate approved  660 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Budget for this program   However  facing a veto threat from the President  this critical funding was reduced to  170 million in the Omnibus Appropriations package     Keeping our communities safe and ensuring that our justice system is fair and effective are top priorities for me in Illinois and throughout the country   said Senator Obama    Since I first met with local law enforcement officials in Alton in 2005 to discuss the growing threats posed to our neighborhoods by meth production and addiction  I have consistently demanded that the President increase funding for the Byrne program   Nearly three years after I joined to introduce legislation to restore this funding  the President has once again slashed these funds   This is unacceptable  and I will work with my colleagues to restore this funding as soon as possible    Since 2005  Senator Obama has urged his Senate colleagues and the President to increase funding for this program  In August of that year  Obama met with nearly a dozen local law enforcement officials and prosecutors at the Alton Law Enforcement Center in Madison County to hear first hand accounts of their experience with problems caused by meth use and production   These officers and prosecutors primarily expressed their concerns about the negative impact these funding cuts would have on drug investigations  particularly relating to meth  throughout the state   After hearing these concerns  Obama returned to Washington and joined several of his colleagues to introduce legislation to save the Byrne JAG program    The text of the letter is below  Dear Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran  Restoration of severe cuts made to the Edward Byrne Justice Grant  Byrne JAG  program through last year s omnibus appropriations bill is vital to avoid law enforcement layoffs and suspension of hundreds of anti drug  gang and violent offender efforts across the country   Therefore  we respectfully request that you provide  489 6 million for the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grant  Byrne JAG  program in any Supplemental Appropriations bill that comes before the Senate   This addition would restore Byrne JAG funding to the same level previously approved by the Senate in the Commerce Justice Science  CJS  Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2008  FY 2008   The Byrne Formula Grant Program is a tried and tested program that has served us well for more than two decades   The program s broad based support was verified in the Senate s passage last year of S 231  the Feinstein Chambliss Byrne JAG Reauthorization Act  which would extend this  1 095 bill authorization through 2012   The bill received 52 co sponsors and passed the Senate by unanimous consent   As you know  the Senate approved CJS Appropriations bill for FY2008 would have funded Byrne JAG at  660 million   Following a veto threat  however  difficult choices had to be made in conference  and in the Omnibus Appropriations bill that ultimately passed  Byrne JAG funding for FY2008 was reduced to only  170 4 million   This figure represented more than a 2 3 drop from Byrne JAG s actual appropriated levels in FY2007  In the wake of these drastic cuts  various law enforcement agencies  as well as numerous police and sheriff s offices  have notified us that these FY2008 Byrne JAG cuts will have a devastating effect on law enforcement  forcing them to possibly close multi jurisdictional drug and gang task forces  and negatively affecting a variety of other crime control programs   Particularly at a time when a risk of adverse economic conditions may lead to increased crime  it is vitally important that we support our nation s finest in their efforts on the front lines  where they risk their lives daily keeping Americans safe  Unless these Byrne JAG funds are restored promptly  law enforcement agencies may be forced to dismantle multi jurisdiction task forces that often took years to create and develop   And individual officers serving on those task force members will face a loss of income or even their jobs  some of which have been held for years  Each year  Byrne JAG dollars fund over 4 000 police officers and prosecutors working on over 750 drug enforcement task forces in all 50 states across hundreds of urban and rural countries and cities   On an annual basis  Byrne JAG funding leads to over 220 000 arrests  54 000 weapons seized  the seizure of 5 5 million grams of methamphetamine  and the breakup of almost 9 000 methamphetamine labs   These successes show that we need to continue what we are doing  not cut back  Funding for Byrne JAG  at its  1 095 billion authorized level  has long been supported by America s leading law enforcement organizations  including the National Narcotic Officers  Associations  Coalition  National Sheriffs  Association  National Association of Counties  National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors  Legal Action Center  National District Attorneys  Association  National HIDTA Directors Association  International Association of Chiefs of Police  Major County Sheriffs Association  National Criminal Justice Association  National Alliance of State Drug Enforcement Agencies  Major City Chiefs Association  National Troopers Coalition  State Association of Addiction Services  the National Crime Prevention Council and the Fraternal Order of Police  There is strong bipartisan support for the Byrne JAG Program  and we urge you to provide this critically needed funding in any supplemental appropriations bill that comes before the Senate this year                                Pursuant to

1265,February 16  2007 Schumer  Clinton  King  Israel  HHS Interpretation of Ryan White Funding Act Dead Wrong   Unfairly Slashes Money for Vital Services for Long Island Patients                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Under New Ryan White Modernization Act  HHS Erroneously Slashing Nassau Suffolk Title I HIV AIDS Funding Because of a Misinterpretation of Legislative Language   With Funding Drying Up  Long Island HIV AIDS Patients are in Danger of Losing Money for Vital Care and Services   Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel Demand Explanation and a Repeal of HHS Decision                      Washington  DC   With thousands of Long Island residents living with HIV and AIDS in jeopardy of losing vital health care and support services provided by Ryan White funding due to a flawed ruling by the Department of Health and Human Service  HHS   today  U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hilary Rodham Clinton and U S  Representatives Peter King and Steve Israel demanded an immediate explanation on how to repeal the decision  HHS recently ruled that the Nassau Suffolk region no longer qualifies as an Eligible Metropolitan Area  EMA  under the recently reauthorized Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006           Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel today argued that HHS misinterpreted the legislative language of the reauthorization  and that  in fact  Nassau Suffolk region does qualify as an EMA  They also demanded that HHS provide an immediate explanation on how to repeal its decision so that Long Islanders living with HIV AIDS don t lose critical services provided in part through Ryan White CARE monies            I am both baffled and dismayed by HHS  recent decision stating that the Nassau Suffolk region no longer qualifies for EMA funding   said Senator Schumer   Because of its misinterpretation  thousands of Long Island residents living with HIV AIDS could end up seeing their essential health related services cut  We re prepared to fight tooth and nail to repeal this flawed decision            I am extremely disappointed in the way in which the Department of Health and Human Services is implementing the recently reauthorized Ryan White CARE Act  We fought for so long to keep these critical funds coming to Nassau and Suffolk counties and to have the Department go against the letter of the law like this is particularly distressing  The new legislation should have ensured that areas like Long Island can continue to receive necessary Ryan White funds  The Administration s failure to apply this definition to the Nassau Suffolk EMA is extremely concerning and I will be calling on the Department of Health and Human Services once again to keep their side of the bargain and recognize the clear need in this region   Senator Clinton said            It is essential that Long Islander s continue to receive the vital care and services provided under this Act   said Congressman King   I will continue to fight to make sure that a simple misinterpretation of language does not jeopardize the lives of my constituents in any way   This is not a matter of semantics  it is a matter of life and death to thousands of people across Long Island            With over 3 200 Long Islanders living with AIDS  now is not the time to cut critical Ryan White funding   said Congressman Israel   Long Island should be praised for its efforts in preventing the spread of AIDS  not punished            We believe that the federal government has misinterpreted the new law to the detriment of Nassau and Suffolk Counties   said Nassau County Executive Thomas R  Suozzi   We are currently reviewing all of our options including litigation  Our low income  uninsured and under insured people living with HIV AIDS depend on the treatment and support services provided through the Ryan White CARE Act  and any decline in the level of funding we receive will greatly affect these programs            It is essential that this critical funding continue as more than three thousand people in Nassau and Suffolk depend on it for essential medical treatment and supportive care   said Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy Adding a second  more restrictive criteria  impacts not only those presently infected but will deny care to newly infected individuals  We thank Congress members Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel for their quick action and their determination to protect our region s interest in the area of funding for care for persons with HIV and AIDS            The Nassau County Executive was recently notified by HHS that the Nassau Suffolk region no longer qualifies as an EMA under the recently reauthorized Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006  The decision to discontinue the Nassau Suffolk region s eligibility as an EMA would devastate the HIV AIDS infrastructure Nassau Suffolk has carefully constructed to care for individuals with HIV AIDS            Under HHS  interpretation of the newly reauthorized Ryan White CARE Act  altered to address underfunded areas of the country  a community must have both 2 000 new AIDS cases over the last five years as well as 3 000 living AIDS cases as reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  data in the most recently reported calendar year  While Long Island meets the requirement for living AIDS cases in the most recently reported CDC data  it falls short of the second requirement  cases going back five years  with only 1 505 newly diagnosed cases for 2001 2005          Today  Schumer  Clinton  King and Israel called for a repeal of the decision  arguing that according to the reauthorization s legislative language  the Nassau Suffolk region only has to meet one of the two requirements to qualify as an EMA  While it does not meet the requirement for newly diagnosed AIDS cases over the last five years  it does meet the requirement of having a total of more than 3 000 living AIDS cases in the most recently reported CDC data  In a February 7th letter sent to HHS  the Senators and Congressmen argued that EMA eligibility is only lost when an area fails to meet both of the above requirements  Today  they also stated that it has been well established that where the conjunctive term  and  is used in statute  the legislative intent is that all of the requirements of statute must be fulfilled   Therefore  the Senators and Congressmen believe that the language of the Act leaves no room for the interpretation that Department of Health and Human Services has reached           ,0
1812,"SEN. SANDERS CALLS BUSH VETO ON IRAQ 'GRAVE ERROR'
  Congress formally sent President Bush a bill setting a timeline for withdrawing American troops from Iraq that Bush vowed to veto.  
   ""President Bush is making a grave error in vetoing this legislation,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said. 
   ""The people of America have made it very clear that they want our government to move in a very different direction, and all Bush is doing is escalating and increasing mistakes he has made over the past four years,"" Sanders added. 
   The death toll for the multinational coalition last month stood at 117, making April the deadliest month of combat casualties in more than two years. 
   ""I find it incredible that Bush would veto the supplemental spending bill, which calls for a timeline of troop withdrawal, at exactly the same time when more coalition troops were lost in one month in Iraq than in any month for two years,"" Sanders said. 
   Sanders also noted a new report by the U.S. State Department that said terrorist attacks mounted in the past year. 
   Terrorist attacks against noncombatants nearly doubled in Iraq and rose sharply in Afghanistan. Worldwide, there was a 29 percent increase in terrorism worldwide, according to a report released Monday by the State Department, but terrorist attacks rose 91 percent in Iraq and 53 percent in Afghanistan, according to the report posted Monday on the State Department's Web site. 
   ""The idea of continuing down a path which results in more and more deaths in Iraq and more and more terrorism makes no sense at all,"" Sanders said. ""We need to bring our troops home as soon as possible, and develop a new approach to combating international terrorism."" 
   The $124.2 billion funding bill would require troops to begin leaving Iraq in October. It sets a goal of full withdrawal by spring of 2008.

1731,"SEN. SANDERS TO OPPOSE SURGEON GENERAL NOMINEE
  Senator Bernie Sanders announced that he would vote against confirmation of President Bush's nominee for surgeon general because he is unconvinced that Dr. James W. Holsinger would withstand pressure from White House political operatives who muzzled the last surgeon general. 
   Sanders, a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, announced his decision after a confirmation hearing. Holsinger was questioned about his independence in light of revelations earlier this week that Dr. Richard Carmona, whose term expired in July, was silenced by the Bush administration on embryonic stem cell research, mental health care, smoking and other health issues. He also was ordered to insert President Bush's name at least three times on each page of his speeches, a demand Sanders called ""outrageous.""
   Sanders said: ""At a time when the administration muzzled the previous surgeon general, censored his remarks, controlled his travel, and - unbelievably - told him how many times in a page he had to mention President Bush, we need a surgeon general who is prepared to stand up to an extremely ideological administration and resist that pressure. We need a surgeon general who will stand up for the scientific and medical needs of the American people. While I was impressed by his intelligence and with some of his positions on issues, I simply do not believe that Dr. Holsinger is the right person for this important position at this moment in American history.""

261,   Murray  Kennedy  Obama and Dorgan Demand Answers on Improper Payments to Lenders   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Murray  Kennedy  Obama and Dorgan Demand Answers on Improper Payments to Lenders Thursday  November  1  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE              CONTACT  Alex Glass  Murray   Melissa Wagoner  Kennedy   Amy Brundage  Obama  or  Barry Piatt  Dorgan    Senators question decision not to recoup payments that could have provided more aid for students     Washington  D C       Today  U S  Senators Patty Murray  D WA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Byron Dorgan  D ND   sent a letter to the Department of Education s Inspector General s Office asking for a complete accounting of the overpayments received by lenders as part of the 9 5 percent Special Allowance Rate program   According to information contained in an Inspector General s report in 2006  and in the Washington Post on October 20th the federal government may have overpaid lenders by hundreds of millions of dollars from 2003 to 2006   Senators Barbara Mikulski  D MD  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  also signed the letter     The 9 5 percent Special Allowance Payment rate began in the 1980   s as a way to increase student access to low cost loans at a time of high interest rates   However  when interest rates fell  the program survived and became beneficial to many lenders since the guaranteed subsidy rate remained at 9 5 percent   At the same time  several lenders received improper payments under this program for loans which were not actually eligible for the 9 5 percent subsidy   This resulted in the overpayment of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from the Department of Education to these lenders      In the letter  the Senators ask the Inspector General to conduct a careful investigation of the total amount of taxpayer dollars spent on overpayments       We believe that the total amount of improper payments is a knowable number  and that taxpayers deserve to know the total amount of these payments   the Senators wrote   Taxpayers also deserve information on which lenders were involved  what methods they used to claim these subsidies unfairly  and why the Department allowed the inappropriate subsidies to be paid   We request that you conduct a careful investigation of these issues        At a time when millions of students and families are struggling to meet the high cost of college  we owe them a full  fair  and transparent accounting of any possible waste or fraud in the student loan programs    The full text of the letter follows    October 31  2007    The Honorable John P  Higgins  Jr   Inspector General  U S  Department of Education  400 Maryland Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20202    Dear Inspector General Higgins    We are writing to request that your office undertake an investigation to determine the full amount of improper special allowance payments made by the Department of Education to student loan lenders through the    9 5 percent loan    subsidy    We greatly appreciate your previous investigations on this issue  which  among other findings  revealed that the Department made  278 million in improper 9 5 percent special allowance payments to Nelnet   As you know  however  dozens of lenders have received 9 5 percent special allowance payments during the 27 year history of the subsidy  so it is likely that the sum total of improper payments is much higher   According to an analysis of Department data by the Washington Post  between 2003 and 2006 alone  as much as  300 million may have been improperly paid to other lenders who received 9 5 percent special allowance payments    As early as 2005  Members of Congress had asked the Department to conduct an audit of all lenders that increased the volume of loans claimed as entitled to the 9 5 percent guaranteed rate of return   The Secretary of Education recently stated that her office does not plan to conduct such an audit  and expressed doubt that the total amount of overpayments is even    a knowable number      We believe that the total amount of improper payments is a knowable number  and that taxpayers deserve to know the total amount of these payments  Taxpayers also deserve information on which lenders were involved  what methods they used to claim these subsidies unfairly  and why the Department allowed the inappropriate subsidies to be paid   We request that you conduct a careful investigation of these issues    Since the 9 5 percent loan scandal first emerged  Congress has acted to limit the inappropriate growth of these loans through recycling  and the Department has prohibited lenders from receiving inflated 9 5 percent special allowance payments in the future   These steps will help curtail future abuses  but the public deserves full knowledge of the funds that were misspent in the past   Your thorough investigation of this issue will help us determine the extent to which Congress needs to oversee the Department   s administration of the federal student loan programs more closely  and inform future debate on the Federal Family Education Loan Program      At a time when millions of students and families are struggling to meet the high cost of college  we owe them a full  fair  and transparent accounting of any possible waste or fraud in the student loan programs   We welcome the opportunity to work with you     With respect and appreciation      Sincerely     Patty Murray                                                      U S  Senator                                                                         Edward M  Kennedy  U S  Senator    Barack Obama

                     New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed the announcement by President Bush of an emergency declaration for Erie  Genesee  Orleans and Niagara Counties  triggering the release of federal funds that will help the community respond to last week s snowstorm            I am pleased that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved our request for an emergency declaration in Erie  Genesee  Orleans and Niagara Counties  The emergency declaration will provide federal funding for emergency protective measures  debris removal and incidental snow removal  Federal funding will cover 75  of the costs associated with the initial response to this emergency           I have seen the extent of the damage with my own eyes and I know that there is much to be done  But I have also seen the incredible efforts of the local community to get back on its feet  I will continue to do everything I can to help Buffalo and the other impacted counties recover and rebuild as soon as possible          I appreciate FEMA  s quick response to our calls for assistance and I will continue my discussions with FEMA to push for a major disaster declaration if it is needed  I will also continue to monitor the power situation as well as other efforts associated with the storm and will continue to work with FEMA and other officials to ensure that the federal government provides any additional support as needed             Last Friday  Senator Clinton joined with Senator Charles Schumer  Congressman Brian Higgins and Congresswoman Louise Slaughter  writing letters to President Bush and Governor Pataki  urging them to take the necessary steps to provide federal aid to the impacted region           According to the President  s office  the action today authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population  and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures  authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act  to save lives  protect property and public health and safety  and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of  Erie  Genesee  Orleans  and Niagara  Under the announcement  Public Assistance will be made available to State and local governments for debris removal and emergency protective measures to save lives  protect public health and safety  and property  FEMA is authorized to identify  mobilize  and provide at its discretion  equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency  Debris removal and emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding         Copies of Friday s letters are below       October 13  2006  The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500 0005      Dear Mr  President       We write in anticipation of a request from Governor Pataki seeking a Major Disaster Area Declaration for Western New York and we urge your quick approval  A major disaster declaration would make the area eligible for federal funding to mitigate the unexpected and un seasonal snow storm that has dropped over 19 inches of snow on Buffalo and the surrounding area  Because this snow is so early in the season  the snowfall  s pressure on trees with leaves still on the branches is causing many to fall resulting in widespread damage to power lines and other infrastructure           The snow has caused excessive damage to infrastructure and private property  cut off power to over 300 000 homes and businesses  closed roadways including 105 miles of the New York State Thruway  and has left area hospitals short on medical staff and patients unable to get care  To recover  residents will need disaster grants and low interest loans to repair their homes and heating systems for the long winter ahead  We also presume that local governments  already stretched by structural financial shortfalls  will need further assistance to restore infrastructure and to assist their citizens  In addition  we ask that you release the remaining emergency Low Income Heating Assistance Program funds to help families in need cope with heating costs           We urge you to approve the declaration request as soon as possible and we look forward to working with you to help the citizens of Western New York recover from this storm           Sincerely                     October 13  2006      The Honorable George E  Pataki  Governor  State Capitol  Albany  NY 12224      Dear Governor Pataki       We write today to pledge our support in securing the maximum federal assistance possible to assist the Greater Buffalo region as it recovers from the record breaking snowstorm of this week  It is our understanding that you have declared four counties in New York to be under a state of disaster  are in the process of completing Preliminary Damage Assessments  PDAs  on the affected area  and will soon formally ask President Bush to declare the region a major disaster area  so that he may immediately activate the federal assistance essential for the response and recovery effort  We want to thank you for your prompt and thorough response to this disaster           As you know  the snowstorm that began yesterday and continued through today dumped between 18 and 24 inches of snow on parts of western New York  At least 350 000 people are without power  and have been told not to expect restored electricity until the middle of next week  The airport has been closed indefinitely  and roads all over the area have been shut down  The National Incident Management Organization has called upon 160 crews from across the country to assist with the shocking number of downed trees  downed wires have caused so many fires that the fire department has been forced to let vacated buildings continue to burn  As the wind speeds pick up  and flurries continue to fall  the damage is only expected to worsen           While the residents and businesses of the Buffalo region are no strangers to snowstorms of great magnitude  it is highly unusual to be hit by such a storm in mid October  Thus  the people and businesses of Buffalo were unprepared for this record breaking storm  and need federal assistance immediately  The Buffalo area simply cannot bear the extra financial burden placed upon it by unexpectedly severe storms           We want you to know that we will fully support you and your office in any way that we can as the affected region recovers  We look forward to working with you to ensure that FEMA will provide these areas with much needed aid  If we may be of any help  please contact          Sincerely          ,0

1960,"HELP MIDDLE-CLASS CHILDREN, END BUSH TAX BREAKS FOR MILLIONAIRES
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) today told colleagues on the Senate Budget Committee that he will ask the full Senate to repeal special tax breaks for households with incomes over $1 million a year. 
   Instead of preserving the tax cuts for the wealthiest 0.3 percent of Americans, Sanders said he would redirect the revenue to Head Start, childcare, special education, nutrition programs, home heating assistance, and to stanch the flow of red ink in President Bush's budget.
   ""At a time when the United States has the highest childhood poverty rate of any major nation; and when seniors are going cold because of inadequate home heating help, we have a moral responsibility to put the needs of our kids and most vulnerable citizens ahead of millionaires and billionaires,"" Sanders said.
   Households with earnings of more than $1 million are projected to receive $51 billion next year thanks to Bush-backed tax breaks enacted in 2001 and 2003. ""My amendment would use $41 billion to increase funding for special education; Head Start; child care; school construction; home heating assistance, and nutrition programs,"" Sanders said. Another $10 billion would go for deficit reduction.
   Sanders would redirect revenue from the millionaires tax breaks to boost funding by:
   * $15 billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. For three decades, the federal government has reneged on its promise to fund 40 percent of the costs of special education for 7 million children. Instead, federal payments cover only 17 percent of the costs, shifting the burden to local property taxpayers.
   * $7 billion to double funding for Head Start. The extremely effective program has been forced to cope with budget cuts that limit enrollment to fewer than half of all eligible children.
   * $2.2 billion for the Child Care Development Block Grant. Today, only about one in seven eligible children receive assistance; 250,000 fewer than in 2000. The president's budget would slash an additional 200,000 children.
   * $3.8 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Woman, Infants, and Children.
   * $5 billion for food stamps.
   * $3 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Home heating oil prices have doubled since President Bush took office. Low-income families with children, grandmothers and grandfathers on fixed incomes, and persons with disabilities need help staying warm in the winter.
   * $5 billion for school construction. The country confronts a $100 billion backlog in needed school repairs. In addition to helping schools, devoting resources to badly-needed construction also would provide jobs for painters, carpenters, electricians, and construction workers.
   The Senate Budget Committee was expected to send to the full Senate a measure that is $18 billion, or 4 percent, more than Bush's budget for non-defense programs such as education, health research, housing and veterans benefits. The House, meanwhile, is working on a version that offers an increase of $22 billion, almost 5 percent. Both plans ratify Bush's $36 billion, or 7 percent, increase for the defense spending. Both plans leave the fate of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to the next Congress and to the new president who will take office next January 20.

1832,"SEN. SANDERS: GREEN JOBS, GLOBAL WARMING
  ""We can break our dependency on fossil fuels, substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions, move to sustainable energy and, in the process, create millions of good paying jobs,"" according to Senator Bernie Sanders. He will chair a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee next Tuesday on how taking measures to reverse global warming can, in the process, create a new sector of the economy known as ""green jobs.""  
   One of the witnesses scheduled to testify at Tuesday's hearing in Washington, D.C. is David Blittersdorf, founder of a Hinesburg, Vt.-based manufacturer of wind energy measurements systems. He also is chairman and executive officer of a new small wind manufacturing company. His NRG Systems serves wind farm clients and wind turbine manufacturers around the world. His newest venture, EarthTurbines, hopes to bring small wind energy technology to homes across the country. Blittersdorf also is a past president of the American Wind Energy Association.
   Sanders and Senator Barbara Boxer, the committee chairman, are the lead sponsors of the comprehensive Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act. Senator Patrick Leahy is a cosponsor as are all of the The most aggressive measure in Congress on global warming, it calls for reducing emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. 
   Also, the Senate on June 12 approved a proposal by Sanders and Senator Hillary Clinton that authorizes $100 million to train workers in ""green collar jobs"" that involve the design, manufacture, installation, operation, and maintenance of clean, efficient energy technologies. 
   Meanwhile, individuals can do their part to reverse global warming. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Americans spend nearly $23 billion a year on energy to light their homes. If every household in Vermont replaced a single inefficient bulb, such as a compact-fluorescent bulb, the resulting energy savings, according to EPA, would be the equivalent of preventing nearly 20 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions each year. That is like removing almost 2,000 cars from Vermont's roadways.

174,   Obama Demands VA Immediately Investigate Drug Testing on Veterans   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Demands VA Immediately Investigate Drug Testing on Veterans Tuesday  June 17  2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                              CONTACT Michael Ortiz  202 228 5566 WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Barack Obama today sent the following letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary James Peake  calling on him to immediately investigate reports that the VA failed to notify veterans about severe side effects from drug testing after the FDA issued a serious warning last November   According to a Washington Times ABC News investigation  more than 1 000 veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  participated in a study to examine ways to end smoking   143 of the study participants took the anti smoking drug Chantix  which the FDA found lead to side effects  including hallucinations  suicide attempts  and psychotic behavior   Study participants were not notified about the FDA warning until three months later  and were not warned about the drug s most severe side effect   suicide    In the letter Obama calls on Peake to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the process by which VA conducts clinical trials and to take immediate corrective action to address the problems that were first identified by GAO eight years ago     The text of the letter is below     Dear Secretary Peake  I was very concerned to read this morning s Washington Times and learn that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  has yet again failed to take appropriate steps to safeguard the health and well being of veterans participating in drug trials  According to a Washington Times ABC News investigation  the VA took three months to notify patients about severe side effects from the anti smoking drug Chantix   Almost 1 000 veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  were paid  30 a month to participate in a study examining ways to end smoking   A total of 143 of the study participants took the anti smoking drug Chantix  Last November  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  issued an alert regarding reports that Chantix led to hallucinations  suicide attempts  and psychotic behavior   Even though almost 40 suicides and more than 400 examples of suicidal behavior were eventually attributed to Chantix nationwide  the VA waited three months after the FDA advisory to alert its study participants about the mental health risks of the drug   And when the VA did finally notify study participants  it failed to mention the most serious side effects of suicide and suicidal thoughts   According to the Washington Times ABC News investigation  21 veterans have reported adverse effects from Chantix   In addition to Chantix  the VA is testing other drugs on veterans with PTSD that carry warnings of suicidal side effects  I understand that clinical research is a vital mission of the VA   Clinical research is not only a source of new treatments for veterans but also a way to recruit and retain the nation s best doctors   However  as I am sure you would agree  the VA has a special responsibility to maintain the most rigorous standards when conducting research on such a vulnerable population   These trials should only be conducted when VA fully informs patients of the risks of the drugs they are taking  and adequately monitors the patients for side effects   These requirements are especially important when dealing with vulnerable patients such as veterans suffering from PTSD  Unfortunately  the lack of protections for participants in clinical trials is a longstanding problem at VA   Following the suspension of all research at the Veterans Affairs of Greater Los Angeles Health Care System in 1999  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified numerous problems in the way that human research subjects were treated at VA facilities  including  failures to provide adequate information to subjects before they participated in research     In a follow up investigation in June 2003  GAO found that  VA has not taken sufficient action to strengthen protections for human subjects since we made our recommendations nearly 3 years ago  and that  VA has not established a mechanism for handling adverse event reports to ensure that  Institutional Review Boards  have the information they need to safeguard the rights and welfare of human research participants   It is outrageous and unacceptable that our government would irresponsibly endanger veterans who have already sacrificed so much for our country   Our veterans   particularly those suffering from mental health injuries   should have the very best health care and support in the world   They should never be needlessly exposed to drugs without proper notification of the dangers involved or effective monitoring of the side effects      It is distressing that our government could once again let down our veterans and their families who have given so much to their country   It is time to demand accountability and to ensure that this kind of breach of trust never takes place again   Accordingly  I call on you to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the process by which VA conducts clinical trials and to take immediate corrective action to address the problems that were first identified by GAO eight years ago    I ask that you notify my office by Friday  June 20  2008  as to whether you will order such an investigation   Thank you    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1

1805,"SEN. SANDERS HOSTS FINLAND'S AMBASSADOR
  Speaking to a standing-room-only crowd of some 300 people in City Hall last night, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) thanked Ambassador Pekka Lintu of Finland for visiting Vermont to discuss what Sanders called ""one of the best economic and social models in the world.""
   The ambassador met with students and faculty at the University of Vermont, where he focused on education. He lunched with business leaders, and in the evening appeared at the packed town hall meeting. 
   ""We should do our very best to learn as much as possible about the best kind of economic and social models that exist throughout the world and, where these models make sense, we should see how we can adopt them to this state and this country. This is especially true today when the United States faces so many difficult problems,"" Sanders said.
   ""It is no secret to anyone in Vermont that the American economy today is in pretty serious trouble: that the middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider. It is also true that despite all the rhetoric about family values, the American worker now works the longest hours of anyone in a major country, and that many of our families are stressed out and exhausted.
   ""It is no secret that our health care system is disintegrating, that 47 million Americans have no health insurance and, despite that, we spend twice as much per capita on health care as any other nation.
   ""It is no secret that the way we treat our children is nothing less than shameful; that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world; our childcare system is totally inadequate; that too many of our kids drop out of school and that the cost of college is increasingly unaffordable. And, in my view, one of the results of how we neglect many of our children is that we end up with more people behind bars, in jail, than any other country on earth. There is a correlation between the highest rate of childhood poverty and the highest rate of incarceration.""
   In talking about the United States and Finland, Sanders noted demographic differences. Finland has a population of 5.2 million people compared to more than 300 million in the United States. Finland has a very homogenous population, while the U.S. is extremely diverse.
   ""And yet, as we acknowledge the difference we should also acknowledge that we are all human beings with very much the same DNA, the same kind of intelligence and the same human needs,"" Sanders said. ""In that context we should ask how does it happen that in Finland they have virtually abolished childhood poverty, have free high quality child care, free college and graduate school education and have, according to international reports, the best primary and secondary educational system in the world. Is there something that we can learn from that model?
   ""In Finland, a high quality national health care program exists which provides almost free health care for all - and ends up costing about half as much per capita as our system. In Finland, when students become doctors and nurses they leave school debt free - because there are no costs in going to school. Is there something we can learn from that model?
   ""In Finland, in the midst of having one of the most competitive economies in the world, 80 percent of workers there belong to unions and the benefits that workers receive there, such as unemployment compensation, dwarf what workers in this country receive. One statistic that I found particularly interesting is that in Finland workers receive 30 days paid vacation, plus ten national holidays.""
   Finland has had its share of problems, Sanders noted, including severe economic downturns and an economy that is not immune to what happens in the rest of the world.
   ""Having said that, there is no question that Finland, as well as other Scandinavian countries have much to be proud of. When one thinks about the long march of human history, it is no small thing that countries now exist, like Finland, which operate under egalitarian principles, which have virtually abolished poverty, which provide almost-free quality health care to all their people, and provide free, high quality education from child care to graduate school. These are models, it seems to me, that we can learn from.""

662,   Obama Statement on Veterans    Affairs Committee Hearing on Marion VA Hospital   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Statement on Veterans    Affairs Committee Hearing on Marion VA Hospital Tuesday  November  6  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  Contact  Amy Brundage  202 615 9467 WASHINGTON  DC    Today  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  submitted the following statement for the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee hearing on  Hiring Practices and Quality Control in VA Medical Facilities   He specifically addressed the issue at the Marion  Illinois VA Medical Center  which saw an increased number of patient deaths over the last months and was found to have employed a surgeon who had been barred from practicing in another state  Obama  along with Senator Dick Durbin  has repeatedly pressed the VA for information on the situation in Marion  The senators sent a letter to Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gordon Mansfield asking additional questions that were raised by the VA   s response  in regard to the unexpected deaths  other patient safety events and the credentialing process for VA doctors   Previously  the senators wrote outgoing Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson asking specific questions about the VA s response to the increase in deaths at the center   They also asked why Dr  Jose Veizaga Mendez  who had been barred from practicing in another state  continued to practice at the Marion VA Center until August  and asked about the background check performed before he was hired   This followed a previous letter to Secretary Nicholson  sent by Durbin and Obama  asking for more information on the ongoing investigation   Obama has also joined Durbin in calling on the U S  Attorney s office to investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing at the Marion VA   Below is Senator Obama s statement to the Committee  which is submitted for the hearing record   Senator Durbin and I have worked to get to the bottom of what went wrong at the Marion facility     and many questions still remain   We will keep fighting for answers  not only for our veterans and those families who have lost a loved one  but for all who have been affected by this loss   That is part of keeping our sacred trust to these true American heroes     While some may argue that the problems at Marion were isolated  I have serious concerns that medical errors  including fatal errors  may have occurred because of more systemic failings in the VA s quality safeguards   GAO testimony about weak internal controls over privileging and physicians practicing with expired privileges in at least one VA facility strongly suggest that this problem may be more widespread   We have asked important questions about the VA s medical credentialing and privileging process  and I hope that Dr  Cross  the Principal Deputy Under Secretary for Health  can provide evidence today as to whether the VA views its current process as adequate   If not  he owes us answers about what he is doing today to improve the process   We also need to address the VA s quality measurement tracking system   The data analysis that flagged the spike in unexpected deaths at the Marion facility     which was part of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program  NSQIP      triggered action almost six months after the period in which that death rate was observed    When we are talking about the quality of care and safety of our veterans  we cannot wait six months to be alerted to and start investigating a tragedy like this one   We must have safeguards that would flag any problems much more quickly and accurately    Furthermore  we still have not yet been able to confirm how many of the deaths from April     September 2007 were unexpected at the Marion VA  and I urge Dr  Cross to provide that answer today   This is an important question because doctors who have since been dismissed were still authorized to operate during this time period   Last week  allegations of serious misconduct and possible criminal wrongdoing were presented to my office by a group of current and former VA employees   These allegations must be thoroughly investigated  not only by the Office of the Inspector General  but by the U S  Attorney s Office   If true  they reinforce the failure in oversight from the VA Health Administration of facilities across the country   When VA employees seek to report a medical error or a problem with the management  they must have protected avenues to do so   The majority of VA health staff perform their jobs with exceptional competence and compassion on a daily basis   They do not have an easy job   And they are the first to agree that our veterans deserve world class medical care   So today  the VA must show us how they will put air tight quality controls in place to anticipate and catch problems before they turn into tragedies                                 Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1
526,   Obama Joins Senators to Call for Investigation of PBCG Pension Payments   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Joins Senators to Call for Investigation of PBCG Pension Payments Wednesday  July  2  2008  For Immediate Release  Contacts  Meghan Dubyak  Brown  or Michael Ortiz  Obama  Senators Cite Cases in Which Pension Beneficiaries Have Been Asked to Repay Thousands of Dollars in Benefits to PBGC   WASHINGTON  D C    Thirteen U S  Senators today called for an investigation of how the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  calculates payments when it assumes responsibility for private pensions  The Senators cited several examples in which retirees have been asked to pay back thousands of dollars worth of overpayments that resulted from incorrect PBGC pension estimates   Retirees should be able to count on a reliable source of income   said Senator Brown  who led the letter requesting the GAO investigation   Individuals living on fixed incomes should not suffer when PBGC s initial estimates are way off or there are unjustifiable delays in finalizing pension payments    Retired folks depend on their pensions to make ends meet  and information gathered by the GAO will help to ensure that seniors can depend on PBGC to get their payments right   said Senator Baucus   Particularly in this turbulent economy  retirees deserve the peace of mind in knowing they will not receive sharp and sudden cuts in their pension benefits because of bureaucratic delays   Senator Bayh said   We have a responsibility to our seniors to take a comprehensive look at the procedures that this congressionally chartered entity utilizes to ensure fair and timely benefit calculations    More than two million Pennsylvanians have their pensions insured by the PBGC   said Senator Casey    Every step must be taken to ensure they receive the correct benefit from PCGC    For seniors and retirees who worked hard for many years and now depend on pensions  reliability is essential  They deserve a transparent and predictable payment process  not the fear that their expected income might suddenly disappear because of a bureaucratic error   Senator Clinton said   I urge PBGC to investigate these troubling reports and make the necessary improvements  Our retirees have earned a system that works     Millions of Americans rely on their pensions to make retirement comfortable and secure and PBGC has a responsibility to provide timely and accurate payments   Senator Durbin said   Miscalculations have resulted in real hardship for America s retirees and we need to get to the bottom of it  I hope this study will allow problems to be identified so that they can be promptly addressed and corrected       An independent assessment by the Government Accountability Office is part of an overall review of how the PBGC makes important calculations  Congress needs to make sure administrative actions by the PBGC don t make things worse for pensioners who are already in a tough situation   Senator Grassley said   The PBGC is responsible for protecting the pensions of millions of Americans and we in Congress are responsible for watching over the PBGC  I am proud to join my colleagues to request this study to help the PBGC better serve the retirees whose pensions they are responsible for   said Senator Mikulski  who chairs the HELP Committee s Retirement and Aging Subcommittee   I know first hand how workers and retirees can be hurt when a factory closes  because it happened to thousands of my constituents at Bethlehem Steel in Baltimore  I will always fight for these hard working men and women and their families to protect what they worked so hard to build    Americans deserve to retire with a stable income  health care benefits and retirement security   said Senator Obama   We must ensure that these retirees are not burdened with unfair and erroneous costs as a result of inaccurate PBGC estimates  I urge the GAO to immediately examine any miscalculations in this process   The pensions of more than 44 million private sector workers and retirees are insured by the PBGC  PBGC is responsible for collecting premiums from plan sponsors and for providing timely and uninterrupted pension payments if plan sponsors file for bankruptcy or terminate plans   When PBGC assumes responsibility for payments  it initially pays a retiree an estimated benefit until it calculates the final amount that beneficiary will receive  However  it often takes PBGC several years to calculate the final benefit amount  When the final benefit amount is lower than the estimated payment  not only do PBGC beneficiaries begin receiving lower pension payments  but they must return the overpayment accrued over time  This often results in financial hardship for retirees living on fixed incomes  The Senators have requested that GAO study several aspects of PBGC performance to determine how its benefit determination process could be improved  Specifically  they requested that GAO    Explain how PBGC estimates initial benefits Determine why there have been noted delays in making final benefit determinations Examine the extent to which retiree benefits change significantly when they become final and the reasons for these changes Examine the discrepancies between negotiated and guaranteed benefits for those retirees whose benefit plans have come under PBGC administration due to plan termination Examine how the PBGC appeals process functions  including the ease of participant access to the process and the length of time that passes awaiting decision    A copy of the letter is below  July 1  2008  Gene Dodaro  Acting Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  N W   Washington  DC 20548  Dear Mr  Dodaro    We are writing to request a GAO assessment of the process by which the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  PBGC  estimates retiree benefits for corporations that it insures  We are concerned about the impact this process has on pension recipients who have suffered lost paychecks  health benefits  and retirement security in the face of economic volatility and outsourcing   The PBGC protects the pensions of more than 44 million private sector workers and retirees in over 30 000 employer sponsored defined benefit pension plans  PBGC s primary responsibility is to collect premiums from plan sponsors and to provide timely and uninterrupted benefit payments when terminations or bankruptcies occur  In the event of plan terminations  PBGC assumes control of plan assets  calculates benefit amounts  and pays recipients a guaranteed benefit  PBGC initially pays retirees an estimated benefit without interruption  but routinely takes several years to calculate the final benefit amount  At times  the final benefit amount is significantly different than initially estimated  In these cases  recipients may face a considerable decrease in monthly payments and may also be forced to pay back overpayments  creating significant financial hardship   The most recent example concerns employees of Republic Technologies International  RTI   a steel company that declared bankruptcy in 2001 and terminated its pension plans for employees in Ohio  Illinois  Indiana  New York  and Pennsylvania in 2002  Although PBGC assumed immediate control of the terminated RTI pension plan  final benefit determinations were not made until this past spring   almost 6 years later  RTI retirees now face significant decreases in monthly benefit payments  some of up to 70 percent  These benefit reductions are compounded by a recoupment policy that has left many retirees in debt to PBGC  some up to  75 000  In light of these circumstances  we are requesting that GAO study several aspects of PBGC performance to determine how its benefit determination process can be improved  Specifically  we would like GAO to determine  1  how PBGC estimates initial benefits  2  why there have been noted instances in which there have been delays in making final benefit determinations  3  to examine the extent to which retiree benefits change significantly when they become final and the reasons for these changes  4  to examine the discrepancies between negotiated and guaranteed benefits for those retirees whose benefit plans have come under PBGC administration due to plan termination  and 5  to examine how the PBGC appeals process functions  including the ease of participant access to the process and the length of time that passes awaiting decision  We would also welcome GAO s recommendations for ways to mitigate any negative impact of PBGC processes on retires and to make benefit determination faster and more accurate  thus improving the service PBGC provides  Thank you for your cooperation in addressing these matters   Please contact Cathy Zebrowski in Senator Brown s office at 224 0719 if you have any questions    Sincerely    Senator Max Baucus Senator Evan Bayh Senator Sherrod Brown Senator Richard Burr Senator Robert P  Casey Senator Hillary Rodham

            Obama  U S  Must Protect Children From Lead  Safeguard Imported Toys Tuesday  August 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Obama Press Office 202 228  5566 Mattel today announced the recall of 253 000 lead contaminated toy jeeps WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to U S  Trade Representative  Ambassador Susan Schwab  about the large number of lead tainted toys manufactured in China that have been subject to federal government recalls   In the letter  Obama requests information as to whether the USTR has raised concerns about these toys with the Chinese government   Last week Obama called on the Toy Industry Association to provide insight as to how American companies are attempting to regulate foreign supply chains   And in July  he called on the Senate Commerce Committee to pass his Lead Free Toys Act of 2007  S  1306   which would protect our children from products containing lead  Obama originally introduced this legislation in November 2005  The text of the letter is below  Dear Ambassador Schwab  I am writing to urge the Office of the United States Trade Representative  USTR  to take aggressive action to protect America   s children from toys containing harmful levels of lead that are imported from China   This is a serious issue that compromises the health of children throughout the country  While lead paint has been banned in the United States since 1978  nearly half a million children continue to suffer from lead poisoning   Lead is a highly toxic substance that can produce a range of health problems in young children including IQ deficiencies  reading and learning disabilities  reduced attention spans  hyperactivity  and damage to the kidneys  brain and bone marrow   Though the most common source of lead exposure is from lead paint in older homes  children are exposed to lead in other ways  including through the toys they play with in their homes  playgrounds  and schools  As you are no doubt aware  in recent months  there have been a number of high profile recalls of children   s products manufactured in China  In March 2007  the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  announced three separate recalls of 108 600 units of children s necklaces and 128 700    Elite Operations    toy sets due to high lead paint content   In April  4 million    Groovy Grabber    bracelets and 396 000 metal key chains were recalled because of high lead content   In May  103 000 pieces of metal jewelry marketed in conjunction with    High School Musical    were recalled because of high lead content   In June  the RC2 Corporation recalled 1 5 million Thomas   Friends wooden toy railway sets that were coated with excessive levels of lead paint   Two weeks ago  Mattel announced the recall of 83 types of toys worldwide because the paint in the toys contained excessive amounts of lead   This worldwide recall involved almost 1 million plastic preschool toys  including the popular Big Bird  Elmo  Dora and Diego characters    And just today  Mattel announced the recall of 253 000 toy jeeps featuring the Sarge character from the movie    Cars       Since we first learned about the dangers of these products  the CPSC has taken steps to remove these toys from store shelves   But recent product recalls raise a larger question about whether our government should take proactive steps to prevent the importation of potentially dangerous children   s products  particularly toys manufactured in China  In 2006  China was the largest importer of toys  dolls  and games to the American marketplace   These imports total  14 6 billion and account for 86  of total U S  imports of toys  dolls  and games   Although most of these toys are safe  recent events suggest that a number of Chinese manufacturers are cutting corners and using cheap and illegal substitutes such as lead paint   The resulting lower prices of many foreign made toys are attractive  especially to low income families  who  along with the rest of our citizens  trust that products imported into the United States undergo a thorough inspection   Unfortunately  it appears that their trust may be misplaced  If we have an opportunity to protect our nation   s most vulnerable population     our children     from harmful toxins  we should do so  and a good place to start is safeguarding their toys   Since the USTR is responsible for developing and coordinating U S  international trade policy and overseeing negotiations with other countries  I am interested in learning the following    Given the large number of toys imported from China with high lead levels  has USTR raised concerns about this issue with the Chinese government   If so  what is the response of the Chinese government to these concerns  If these concerns have not been raised with the Chinese government  does USTR intend to raise this issue in the near future  I request that you respond to these questions by August 21  2007   Thank you  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                    ,1

234,   Obama Calls for Increased Cafe Standards  Updated RFS in Energy Bill   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama Calls for Increased Cafe Standards  Updated RFS in Energy Bill Monday  November 19  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 224 5511 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  calling on them to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards and expand Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  in the comprehensive energy bill currently being negotiated in the House and Senate   The leaders have said they will send an energy bill to President Bush by the end of this year    In October  Obama joined Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  to introduce legislation to immediately update the RFS to require the production of 18 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2016 including 3 billion gallons of advanced biofuels  such as cellulosic ethanol   This legislation recognizes the need for prompt action to update these renewable fuel requirements to provide market certainty to small  local  and farmer owned ethanol producers   Obama has also been a leader in the Senate in pushing for higher CAFE standards  introducing bipartisan bills in both 2006 and 2007  The text of the letter is below  Dear Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi  I strongly support your joint efforts to send a comprehensive energy bill to the President before the end of the year   As oil prices edge toward  100 a barrel and the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change become more evident every day  your leadership on this issue is needed and greatly appreciated  Both chambers passed energy bills earlier this year that would decrease our nation   s dependence on imported oil and reduce the carbon emissions that contribute to global climate change   Of particular importance are the enactment of a meaningful increase in Corporate Average Fuel Economy  CAFE  standards and an extension and update of the Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  which  together  constitute an essential foundation for the achievement of these critical national objectives   Stricter fuel efficiency standards will result in the reduction of carbon emissions   And the promotion of biofuels usage will allow us to meet those standards quicker and with clean burning  renewable  home grown fuel  With regard to CAFE  raising those fuel efficiency standards by 4  annually up to 40 mpg by 2020 could save Americans a total of 549 billion gallons of gasoline  while cutting warming pollution by 6 094 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent gases by 2028   That analysis provides some perspective on the progress that can be made if Congress summons the political will to act boldly  As for the RFS  the Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandated the use of 7 5 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the national gasoline supply by 2012   Two years later  production is now projected to reach 12 billion gallons by the end of 2008   But as ethanol usage passes the congressionally mandated  annual RFS targets  the major oil companies lose any incentive to use more renewable fuels in their supplies or to make higher ethanol blends like E85 available at their service stations   As a result of the renewable fuels industry   s productivity and the petroleum industry   s intransigence  the average national ethanol price on the spot market has plunged 30  in the last six months    The consequences of this development for our dual goals of reducing carbon emissions and displacing fossil fuels are severe   The ethanol industry has been suspending construction starts and facing significant cash flow problems in the face of declining prices   And large multinational corporations have responded by talking publicly about acquiring failing community sized ethanol plants at bargain basement prices  thereby consolidating their position in the industry and increasing their ability to control prices  This clearly hurts farmers and the rural economy   It is also not good for the environment   If current trends continue  the infant cellulosic biomass industry will likely see capital investment falter just when it is needed for the commercialization of developing  higher risk technologies   And finally  the consumer is hurt if we don   t break this policy logjam  as increased availability of domestic ethanol supplies has been proven to reduce gasoline prices at the pump    The Senate passed energy bill anticipated this problem and updated RFS targets to 15 billion gallons by 2015 and 36 billion by 2022   Until those updated levels are enacted  we risk stalling further development of the existing biofuels industry and jeopardizing timely investment in next generation cellulosic fuels from non food sources   I have always felt that higher fuel efficiency standards and the renewable fuels standard together are key to reducing the use of fossil fuels     and especially imported oil     reducing carbon emissions  and building a bridge from the use of corn ethanol to the use of cellulosic biomass ethanol   We jeopardize this potential and risk slowing down economic growth in rural America if Congress does not raise the RFS targets this year  I share your assessment that time is of the essence in moving a meaningful energy bill that includes a CAFE increase and an RFS upgrade through Congress to the President   s desk   And now that the Senate Republicans have united to block passage of the Farm Bill  we should not let a critical investment in our renewable energy future fall victim in the crossfire   I stand ready to do whatever I can to support you in this effort  Sincerely  Barack Obama  United States Senator                                 Pursuant to  policy

140,   Obama Introduces Bill to Reduce Teen Pregnancies in Minority Communities   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama Introduces Bill to Reduce Teen Pregnancies in Minority Communities Monday  July 16  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  CONTACT  Ben LaBolt      Legislation would strengthen community based efforts  establish national information database WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2007  which would help prevent teen pregnancies in minority communities   This legislation would strengthen community based intervention efforts for teen pregnancy services  establish a comprehensive national database to provide culturally and linguistically sensitive information on teen pregnancy reduction  and support research on teen pregnancy in communities of color   U S  Representative Hilda Solis sponsored this bill in the House  H R  468       Teen pregnancy can derail the plans of students with dreams of achieving professional success  and it   s hitting minority communities particularly hard     said Senator Obama      While the country   s overall teen birth rate continues to decline  pregnancies in African American and Latino communities remain inexcusably high   We must develop innovative approaches to strengthen our community support networks and services to educate our teens about pregnancy and provide them with every chance to succeed in school and beyond      Recently  the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics released a study showing that in 2005  the teen birth rate hit a new low   In 2005  the adolescent birth rate was 21 per 1 000 young women ages 15 17  which represents a decline of more than 40 percent from 1991 to 2005   Yet despite this good news  nearly 750 000 teens will become pregnant this year and approximately 4 million will contract a sexually transmitted infection   According to the Forum study  communities of color continue to be at significantly higher risk for teen pregnancies    The birth rate among 15 17 year old African American and Latina adolescents is 3 times and 4 times higher  respectively  than the rate for white teens   According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy  over half of Latina teens and African American girls will get pregnant at least once before age 20   The Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act creates a three pronged approach to reverse these trends   This bill provides grants to public and private non profit entities for community based intervention efforts targeting schools  the family  and the media to promote and strengthen communication and services regarding teen pregnancy   It establishes grants for the creation of a National Clearinghouse to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate information and technical assistance to those seeking to reduce rates of teen pregnancy   Finally  this legislation supports research on teen pregnancy in communities of color    The Communities of Color Teen Pregnancy Prevention Act of 2007   Community Based Intervention Programs The main emphasis of the bill is on community based intervention programs to prevent teen pregnancy   This section receives the majority of funding provided by the bill for grants for public or non profit private entities to carry out teen pregnancy prevention programs in racial and ethnic or immigrant communities with higher than average teen pregnancy rates  To receive a grant  an applicant could apply one or more of the following strategies to prevent teen pregnancy and STI   s   Promote family communication  especially between parents guardians and children   Educate community members about the consequences of teen pregnancy  or  Provide medically accurate contraceptive information for sexually active teens  or those at high risk for engaging in sexual activity  and talk about the responsibilities of parenthood   This section would also require HHS to fund its own evaluation of six programs funded by grants in this section

2008  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   CONTACTS  Liz Richardson Kerry   Michael Ortiz Obama   Liz Farrar  Ellsworth   or Kathleen Connery  Emanuel   Reform Closes Offshore Tax Loopholes that Government Contractors Use To Dodge Social Security Taxes  WASHINGTON  DC   Sens  John Kerry  D Mass   and Barack Obama  D Ill   are introducing the  Fair Share Act of 2008   today with Reps  Brad Ellsworth  IN  and Rahm Emanuel  D Ill   The reform will close the loophole that recently has allowed the defense contractor KBR Inc  to fleece the American taxpayer by almost  100 million a year   It was discovered that KBR has avoided paying its fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   Setting up sham companies in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying Social Security taxes for workers turns the idea of patriotism on its head  No wonder Americans are disgusted with Washington when big corporations profit from no bid contracts for the war in Iraq  then hide money and costs offshore to avoid paying taxes while hard working Americans get stuck with the bill   said Sen  Kerry    KBR is abusing the public trust at the taxpayer s expense  and our reform will close the loophole that enables big corporations to take advantage of the American people     American companies have a responsibility to pay taxes  and guarantee that their employees will receive the Medicare and Social Security benefits they are entitled to through their employment   said Sen  Obama    It s unacceptable for Federal contractors to use foreign affiliates or tax shelters in order to avoid paying their share of payroll taxes and to shirk on their basic obligations to American workers   This critical legislation will increase accountability and transparency of our tax system  and ensure that Federal contractors who are working on behalf of the American taxpayer do not abuse the tax system    These government contractors have been receiving millions  sometimes billions  in taxpayer dollars  Yet they still have the audacity to circumvent our tax system and cheat their workers  the taxpayers  and our government   said Rep  Ellsworth   It s clear Congress cannot stand by and hope these companies will do the right thing  The Fair Share Act restores some needed accountability to the government contracting process  protecting American workers and ensuring all companies compete on an equal playing field    Honest middle class American taxpayers who pay their taxes deserve a tax system where companies cannot use every trick in the book to rig the system to avoid paying their fair share   said Rep  Emanuel   Known best this week as the company who gave our troops tainted water  KBR is taking advantage of a tax loophole that hurts Social Security and Medicare and prevents their own U S  employees working abroad from being able to qualify for these vital programs  And just like we did in 2004 when we closed the Bermuda loophole that allowed companies to lower their taxes by setting up a mailing address in Bermuda  we are going to shut down this egregious loophole   Summary of the Legislation The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U S  government contractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes   The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U S  companies performing services under contract with the United States government as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes   The legislation will apply to foreign subsidiaries of a U S  parent   The degree of common ownership applied by the legislation is 50 percent  meaning that the U S  parent would have to at least own 50 percent of the subsidiary  In addition  the legislation addresses the situation in which a U S  subsidiary of a foreign corporation subcontracts with a foreign subsidiary to perform a contract with the U S government   In this situation  the legislation would apply to wages paid by the foreign subsidiary to its U S  employees  The legislation does not address the situation in which the foreign parent contracts directly with the U S  government   Present law will continue to apply to totalization agreements   Effective Date of Legislation  This legislation applies to services performed after the date of enactment

1847,"VERMONT DELEGATION WINS ANOTHER KEY VICTORY IN EFFORT TO EXTEND, EXPAND MILC PROGRAM
  After intense negotiations, House and Senate conferees on a supplemental spending bill have accepted legislation backed by the Vermont Congressional Delegation that would pave the way for a full extension and expansion of the safety net that helps dairy farmers ride out downturns in milk prices. House and Senate Appropriations Committee negotiators late Monday approved the bill that includes the MILC provisions.
   The bill also includes more than $3 billion in farm disaster relief funds long awaited by farmers in Vermont and in other states but which were blocked last year by the Republican-led Congress, and it also sets aside $20 million to help dairy farmers in Vermont and across the country. 
   The House and Senate are expected to vote on the supplemental appropriations bill this week. President Bush has said he will veto the bill because it includes a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq. After the veto, Congress will reformulate the bill and send it back to his desk. 
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a leading conferee on the bill, said, ""As usual on dairy issues, we're on a high-wire walk across many obstacles, and any misstep can be perilous. But for the MILC program, it's so far, so good.""
   The provision included in the final version of the bill was the Senate's language, authored by Leahy, which provides a 10-year baseline that ensures mandatory funding for the MILC (Milk Income Loss Contract) program and would lay the groundwork for reauthorizing and expanding the program in this year's Farm Bill. The counterpart House bill also included a MILC provision that would extend the program for 13 months, though without Leahy's ten-year funding baseline. The Vermont's congressional delegation - Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) and Rep. Peter Welch (D) - have worked closely together to advance the Senate's MILC provisions. Their effort is part and parcel of their joint effort to build a coalition of support for extending and improving the MILC program in this year's Farm Bill.
   Leahy said, ""Farmers are hurting, and many are making plans now not just for this season but also for their future. They need to know the MILC program will continue to be there when they need it.""
   Sanders said, ""Family dairy farmers in Vermont and across this country are up against the wall with high feed and energy costs. The Vermont delegation is working every angle to see that family farmers get the help they need to continue farming. Getting this one-month extension of the MILC program is a critical first step in our efforts to create an effective safety net for dairy farmers.""
   Welch said, ""Many of Vermont's dairy farmers are struggling to survive and all they have ever asked for is a fighting chance to succeed. This agreement sets the stage for our delegation to fight for reauthorization of the MILC program in the upcoming Farm Bill.""
   Leahy, Sanders and Welch also said this bill may be the last chance to enact the farm disaster aid, which would help Vermont farmers recover from flood losses last year. ""Last year's floods compounded the setbacks that farmers are enduring, and it is unconscionable that last year's Congress and the White House have stood in the way to prevent this overdue relief,"" said Leahy.

1943,"SENATE APPROVES VETERANS OUTREACH PROGRAM
  The Senate approved $10 million for a national outreach program to assist returning service members and their families. The program, proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders, is modeled on a first-of-its-kind program in Vermont funded with $1 million previously secured by Sanders. 
  ""We have a moral responsibility to reach out to these soldiers and their families and to help them,"" Sanders said.
  The Senate on Monday authorized the national pilot program in a Department of Defense policy bill. Then late on Wednesday the Senate okayed a separate appropriations bill that included $10 million for the national program.
  Senator Patrick Leahy cosponsored the legislation setting up the national pilot program.
  ""My hope is that increased coordination between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs and local and state organizations will mean that veterans and their families will be better informed and more likely to get the care they deserve,"" Sanders said. 
  Describing the problems some returning service members confront, Sanders told colleagues that ""all across our country, men and women are returning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and in too many cases they are hurting.
  ""These are soldiers and military family members who are suffering with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, or depression. They are watching their marriages and their families coming apart. They are suffering nightmares and panic attacks. Their symptoms sometimes include uncontrollable anger and various physical symptoms. Because of the stigma, many of these brave soldiers do not come forward for help. Others, where the military infrastructure is not strong, simply don't know where to turn. They and their families, in many cases, are hurting and we owe them our help. ""
  The pilot program will allow adjutant generals around the country to apply for funds to create state-based outreach programs. The programs will provide referral services on a wide range of issues including mental health counseling, veterans benefits, military benefits, marriage counseling, financial counseling, suicide prevention, substance abuse, financial counseling and other services.

          Washington  DC    Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has authorized  198 million for New York City under the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   including a  180 million for an ecosystem restoration project for Jamaica Bay and  18 2 million for Orchard Beach in the Bronx  The bill includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility   The bill  which was passed by the Committee today  must now be approved by the full Senate before being sent to a House and Senate Conference Committee         The Water Resources Development Act authorizes Corps of Engineers civil works projects  including navigation  ecosystem restoration and shoreline protection projects   Under the authorizations  the Corps partners with local sponsors to conduct the projects            The Corps of Engineers has an excellent record protecting and improving New York waterways   with a good return on the investment for taxpayers  Nobody is better than the Corps for cleaning out the sediment that accumulates on harbor floors that makes it harder for big ships to deliver and pick up goods here   Now  for the first time  we  re developing a good new system to reuse that accumulation as a building material     Senator Schumer said          New York  s waterways are the lifeblood of the city    transporting thousands of tons of goods each day  sheltering diverse wildlife and providing recreational fun for millions of people each year  This bill will help the Corps continue to keep the port running smoothly   It will also help the Corps to clean up and restore beaches and bays around the city for future generations     Senator Clinton said        The Senators announced that the bill passed by Committee today included the following authorizations       Jamaica Bay  Marine Park and Plum Beach Ecosystem Restoration    The bill includes a  180 million authorization for an ecosystem restoration project for Jamaica Bay  NY   The federal government share of the costs would be  117 million   The project would restore valuable inter tidal wetland areas in Jamaica Bay to support fish and wildlife habitat in this highly diverse and nationally significant ecosystem   It is expected that eight specific sites will be recommended for work by the Corps of Engineers   The authorization is dependent on completion of a Chief of Engineer  s report  which is expected by the end of 2005        Orchard Beach    The bill modifies an existing authorization for Orchard Beach in the Bronx  New York  to increase the authorization to  18 2 million   Orchard Beach is visited by more than two million people each year  but the beach is suffering from severe erosion and the sand needs to be replenished   The purpose of this project is to restore and stabilize this heavily utilized public recreational beach  The Water Resources Development Acts of 1992 and 1996 authorized a total of  5 6 million for the study and execution of an Orchard Beach shoreline protection project   The current WRDA would increase that authorization to  18 2 million         New York Harbor Dredged Material Management Facility     The bill includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility   The disposal of sediments dredged from New York Harbor has become increasingly more costly over the past decade due to the Environmental Protection Agency  s promulgation of more stringent rules governing the disposal of these materials at sea   This has led to efforts in both New York and New Jersey to find beneficial uses for dredged materials   Most of these efforts to date have focused on using dredged materials that have been processed with additives such as Portland Cement or incinerator ash to create a stable  construction material that have been successfully used as a grading material at landfills and brownfields   Development of the facility will enable more flexibility in matching the timing of the availability of dredge material with the needs of end users  which will encourage competition and reduce the costs of upland dredge material disposal   The facility would accept dredged material from both federal channels and private berthing facilities

1944,"SEN. SANDERS VOTES AGAINST CONFIRMATION OF NUSSLE AS OMB DIRECTOR
  President Bush continues to tell the American people how great the economy is doing. Bush and his advisors say the economy is ""strong and getting stronger,"" the economy is ""thriving,"" the economy is ""robust,"" the economy is ""vibrant;"" the economy is ""solid,"" the economy is ""booming,"" the economy is ""powerful,"" the economy is ""fantastic,"" the economy is ""amazing,"" and ""marvelous,"" He's wrong, of course, as every American living from paycheck to paycheck knows. The Senate on Tuesday has a chance to tell him so when it votes on the president's nominee to be the White House budget director. 
   ""Personally, I like Jim Nussle,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said. ""We came to Washington together and I worked with him for 16 years in the House of Representatives. He's smart. He is passionate. My strong opposition to Jim Nussle becoming Director of the Office of Management and Budget has much less to do with Mr. Nussle and much more to do with the current failed trickle-down economic policies of the Bush administration. The problem is that the president and his advisors have become increasingly isolated and out of touch with the economic realities facing ordinary Americans. While the middle class continues to shrink, poverty is increasing, the gap between the rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider, and millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages.
   ""How can the president claim that the economy is ""robust"" when nearly five million Americans have slipped into poverty since 2000, including over one million children? How can the president say the economy is ""vibrant"" when median income for working-age families has declined by about $2,400 since 2000? How can Bush claim that the economy is ""strong and getting stronger"" when the personal savings rate has been below zero for eight consecutive quarters, something that hasn't happened since the Great Depression? How can he claim that the economy is ""healthy"" when 8.6 million Americans have lost their health insurance since 2000, and a record-breaking 47 million Americans are uninsured with millions more under-insured?
   ""How can the president and his advisors claim that the economy is ""thriving"" when 35 million Americans in our country, the richest country in the history of the world, struggled to put food on the table last year and the number of the hungriest Americans keeps going up? How can he claim that our economy is ""booming"" when college students are graduating, on average, with about $20,000 in debt and some 400,000 qualified high school students don't go to college in the first place because they can't afford it? How can he say the economy is ""fantastic"" when home foreclosures are now the highest on record, turning the American dream of home-ownership into the American nightmare for millions of Americans? How can he claim that the economy is ""powerful"" when the number of working families paying more than half of their limited incomes on housing has increased by 72 percent since 1997?
   ""While the president tells us how ""robust"" and ""vibrant"" the economy is, the American people know better. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll published last month, more than two-thirds of Americans said they believe the U.S. economy is either in recession now or will be in the next year. Meanwhile, 72 percent of Americans surveyed in the most recent Gallup Poll said the economy was ""getting worse,"" the most pessimistic outlook on the economy since Gallup began asking the question in the early 1990s. Moreover, consumer confidence is at a two-year low and the number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits increased for five consecutive weeks something that hasn't happened since May of last year.
   ""The fact that the economy is not booming should not be rocket science. If the president spoke to workers whose jobs have been outsourced to China, or middle class families who are trying to send their kids to college, he might get a clue as to what was happening in the real world. But as long as the president lives in a cocoon surrounded by advisors who won't tell him what's really going on in America, he is not going to be able to develop policies that help solve our nation's problems.
   ""What the Bush administration needs is a serious reality check. And, the reality is that each and every morning millions of Americans drag themselves out of bed and wonder how they are going to pay the bills. Their day begins by taking their kids to daycare. And, many of them wonder is this the last day that they will be able to afford childcare? Who will take care of their kids? Mom isn't able to stay at home like she was able to do 30 years ago. That is not an option. It now takes two-incomes to support a family. That is the first reality check. Then they drive to work, and many of them wonder how they are going to pay for the price of gasoline, and you know what, Mr. President? They start to get angry. They understand that for the past 2 years, Exxon-Mobil has made more profits than any company in the history of the world. They hear that the former CEO of Exxon Mobil, Lee Raymond, received a $400 million retirement package, and that gets them mad.
   ""But, they can't stay angry about that for very long because then they have to go to work. And, at work, many of them will receive a notice from their employer that their pension is being cutback; their healthcare premiums will be rising; their prescription drug coverage has been eliminated; their pay will be going down, and, by the way, if they try to complain, their job is going to China. Their job is going to Mexico. Their job is going to Vietnam. Or even more insulting, they will have to train their own replacement who just came in from India on an H-1B visa.
   ""So, they put up with the cuts to their pension. They don't object to the cutbacks in their health benefits. They even accept a cut in their pay and they stay on the job. They play by the rules, they don't say a word, and they pray that their job will be there tomorrow.
   ""And, then, after working 8, 10, 12 hours, they go to their mail box. And, they open it up. And, what do they find? They find out that the interest rate on their credit card (the credit card that they are using to pay for childcare, to pay for gasoline, to buy groceries, diapers and prescription drugs) has tripled even though they were never late paying the bill. They find out that the interest rate on their Adjustable Rate Mortgage will double next month. And, some of them have learned that their utility bill will be going up by 50 to 70 percent. That is the reality that millions of middle class Americans have to live with every single day. And, what I fear the most is that if we keep going in the direction that we are headed our children and our grandchildren will have a lower standard of living than we do. We must not allow that to happen, but I am afraid that it already is. According to a recent joint study by the Pew Charitable Trust and the Brookings Institution men in their 30s earned on average 12 percent less in 2004 than their fathers did in 1974 after adjusting for inflation.
   ""President Bush desperately needs a budget director who is not afraid to tell the president the truth about these harsh economic realities, not an echo. He needs a budget director who will make him face the facts, not fan his fantasies. And, perhaps most importantly, he needs a budget director who is willing to compromise with a Democratic Congress for the benefit of all of the American people, not just large corporations, and the wealthy few. Unfortunately, I am afraid Jim Nussle is not that person.
   ""A budget, after all, is more than a long list of numbers. The federal budget, like any family budget is a statement of our nation's values and priorities. In fact, the federal budget is a statement of what our country is all about. We would all, I think, find it irresponsible and counterproductive if a family spent all of their money on an expensive vacation, didn't have enough money to pay the rent and wound up out on the street. Most of us would view this as an example of misplaced priorities. The family, in this case, is spending money where it shouldn't and not spending it where it should.
   ""Preparing the federal budget is exactly the same process. It's about spending taxpayer dollars where we should and not spending it where we should not. It's about taking a hard look at the needs of our people and prioritizing the budget in an intelligent and rationale way.
   ""Now, in February, the president told us about his values and his priorities when he submitted his Fiscal Year 2008 Budget to Congress. Let's look at his values and his priorities.
   ""The president has proposed in his budget that, despite the growing health care crisis in our country, he would like to cut Medicare and Medicaid by $280 billion over the next decade, lowering the quality of healthcare for approximately 43 million senior citizens and people with disabilities who depend on Medicare and more than 50 million Americans who rely on Medicaid. The lack of health insurance kills more Americans each year than September 11th and Katrina combined. In fact, the National Academy of Science estimates that 18,000 Americans die each year because they have no health insurance. And, the President's budget proposal would make a bad situation even worse. Healthcare isn't just a human rights issue, it isn't just a moral issue, it is an economic issue as well. Small businesses cannot survive if they are forced to pay huge increases in healthcare premiums each and every year. Even large businesses like General Motors and Ford are struggling like they have never struggled before to pay for the healthcare of their employees, and have threatened to move all of their U.S. plants to China, Mexico and elsewhere if their workers don't accept huge cutbacks in health and retirement benefits. Right now, we spend twice as much per person on health care than any other industrialized nation, yet we have a lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality rate than Canada, Japan and most of Europe. In fact, the United States is the only country in the industrialized world that does not have a national health care system. Even worse, at a time when 8.7 million children have no health insurance, the President has refused to adequately fund the Children's Health Insurance Program in his budget.
   ""Now, here's where the president really needs some good advice. Last month, we all know that the Senate voted by a 68 to 31 margin to expand the S-CHIP program to provide an additional 3 million kids with health insurance at a cost of $35 billion over five years. Eighteen Republican senators thought this was a good idea. Though, I believed the Senate should have done much, much more, I also voted for this legislation. The House passed an even more generous bill to expand S-CHIP with the support of 5 Republicans But, instead of working with the Senate and the House, the President issued veto threats on both of those bills because he believes, among other things, that we don't have enough money.
   ""While the president doesn't believe we have enough money to increase health insurance coverage for children, it has been reported that the President will be asking for another $50 billion for the misguided war in Iraq. He wants $50 billion in additional funding for the Iraq War, but we don't have $5 to $10 billion per year to provide health insurance to millions of uninsured children. It's time that the President had a Budget Director who was willing to say, ""Excuse me, Mr. President, but that is wrong.""
   ""It's time to get our priorities straight. I am afraid that Mr. Nussle will not do this. Mr. Nussle is the wrong man, at the wrong time for this position.
   ""What else does the president's budget have to say about the priorities of this country? What about childcare?
   At a time when our childcare and early childhood education systems are totally inadequate to meet the needs of working parents, the Bush budget reduces the number of children receiving childcare assistance by 300,000.
   ""Amazingly, child care fees today are higher than college tuition at a four year public university in 42 states in this country. In other words, we have a childcare crisis in this country. The President's response: Deny childcare to 300,000 children. That is wrong! The President needs an OMB Director to tell him that. Jim Nussle is the wrong person, at the wrong time for this job.
   ""What else? The president's budget provides a $100 million cut to the Head Start program. Today, only about half of the children eligible for this important and excellent program actually participate in Head Start due to a lack of funding. In other words, millions of kids cannot get into Head Start. The President's response: Cut Head Start funding. That is wrong. He needs a Budget Director to tell him that. Jim Nussle is the wrong person for that job.
   ""As I mentioned earlier, while hunger in this country is shamefully increasing, the president's budget proposes to deny food stamps to 280,000 families and eliminates nutrition assistance to over 400,000 senior citizens, pregnant mothers, and newborn children. That is unacceptable. The president needs a Budget Director who understands this. Jim Nussle is the wrong man for that job.
   ""What else? Well, we are in a war in Iraq. We are in a war in Afghanistan. The number of our veterans is increasing. More than 27,000 have been wounded, many seriously. Many will come back to this country with post-traumatic stress disorder. Yet the President has proposed cutting the VA budget by $3.4 billion over five years, after adjusting for inflation. And, on and on it goes.
   ""In this great country, with so many people struggling desperately to keep their heads above water, we should not be cutting back on the promises made to our veterans. We should not be cutting back on health care. We should not be cutting back on nutritional benefits for senior citizens on fixed-incomes and pregnant mothers. We should not be cutting back on Head Start, affordable housing, and educational opportunities for middle-class families. That is what we should not be doing. The President needs a Budget Director who understands this. Jim Nussle will not do this. He is the wrong man at the wrong time for this job. Just look at the Budget Resolutions Mr. Nussle crafted as Chairman of the House Budget Committee. In most cases, Jim Nussle's budgets were even more extreme than the president's.
   ""Now, while the president has said in his budget that we don't have enough money to address the needs of the middle class, working families, senior citizens, children and veterans, the President has said that we do have enough money to provide $739 billion in tax breaks over the next decade to households with incomes exceeding $1 million per year. The average tax break for this group of millionaires will total $162,000 by the year 2012.
   ""Let me be very blunt. In my view it is wrong, in my view it is immoral to give huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires -- the people who need them the least --while cutting back on the needs of the middle-class and working families of our country. That is wrong.
   ""Is the president's budget, a reflection of the values of the people of our country? I do not believe that. I do not believe ordinary Americans think it is right and appropriate to give tax breaks to billionaires and then provide inadequately for our veterans, for our children, and for our seniors. That is not, in my view, what America is about.
   ""We are told over and over again by the president and this administration that we do not have the money to reduce childhood poverty in this country. We are told we do not have the funds to wipe out the disgrace of hunger in America. We are told we do not have enough money to make sure the young people who graduate from high school in this country, who are excited about going to college, will be able to do so without coming out deeply in debt.
   ""We do not have the money to help those families. Yet, while we turn our backs on the middle-class and working families of our country, it appears we have plenty of money for the millionaires and billionaires of this country. We have tens of billions, in fact, to shower on those who need it the least, yet we have nothing, and we are cutting back on the programs, for those who need it the most.
   ""Included in the president's budget, amazingly, is the complete repeal of the estate tax which would take effect at the end of 2010. The complete repeal of this tax would benefit only the top three-tenths of 1 percent of the American people. Let me repeat that. The complete repeal of the estate tax would benefit solely the upper three-tenths of 1 percent of the American population.
   ""These are families, of course, who already are millionaires and billionaires, and these are families who in the current economy have been doing exceedingly well. In other words, 99.7 percent of Americans would not benefit by one nickel from the complete repeal of the estate tax, as proposed by the President.
   ""According to the president's budget, this repeal of the estate tax would reduce receipts for the Treasury by more than $91 billion over the next 5 years and more than $442 billion over the next decade. But the long-term damage to our fiscal solvency is even worse. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, repealing the estate tax would cost over $1 trillion from 2012 to 2021 -- over $1 trillion. In other words, if the president's plan to permanently repeal the estate tax succeeds, the children and family members of the most privileged families in America will reap a massive tax break. Instead of closing the gap between the rich and the poor, instead of addressing the huge national debt and deficit problems we have, we make both situations worse by fully repealing the estate tax.
   ""The granddaddy of all of the winners under the Bush budget is none other than the heirs to the Wal-Mart fortune. If the estate tax was completely repealed, the entire Walton family would receive an estimated tax break of $32.7 billion -- that is $32.7 billion in tax relief for one family which today happens to be one of the wealthiest families in this country already. Meanwhile, in contrast, the president's budget proposes to cut Medicaid by $28 billion over the next decade, driving up the cost of health care for tens of millions of Americans. In other words, while one of the wealthiest families in this country gets a tax break of over $30 billion, tens of millions of Americans - children and seniors included -- will suffer. Now, that may make sense to the president, that may be fair to Jim Nussle, who also voted to repeal the estate tax, but it sure does not make sense to me. In other words, if the president's proposed budget passes, millions of Americans will lose, including some of the most vulnerable people in our country, while one very wealthy family wins.
   ""A second major beneficiary of the president's tax cuts are the heirs to the Mars candy bar fortune. Now, I like Snickers as much as anybody. And I do not want to be seen here as attacking Snickers, one of the basic food groups of American society. But the family that owns Mars is slated to receive an estimated $11.7 billion tax break if the estate tax is fully repealed. Meanwhile, the president's budget proposes cutting the VA budget by $3.4 billion over the next five years. This comes at a time when hundreds of thousands of veterans are forced onto a waiting list to receive the healthcare benefits they were promised because of a lack of funding. Veterans lose under the Bush budget.
   ""Another major winner in the president's budget is the Cox family. They are the heirs to the Cox cable fortune. They will gain $9.7 billion if the estate tax is repealed. Meanwhile, while the Cox family would receive almost $10 billion in tax breaks, the president wants to cut funding for education by $1.5 billion. The president keeps talking about No Child Left Behind while his budget continues to leave, in fact, millions of children behind. In Vermont and all over this country, school districts are struggling with grossly inadequate funding for special education, which the President also wants to cut. We do not have the money to fund special education to improve public education in America. We do not have that money. But we do have $9.7 billion for one family, the Cox family.
   ""Another major beneficiary of the president's budget is the Nordstrom family, owners of the upscale department store chain. By repealing the estate tax, the Nordstrom family stands to receive an estimated $826 million tax break, according to the April 2006 report from United for a Fair Economy. Tax breaks of over $800 million for an enormously wealthy family, and yet we see a $630 million cut in the President's budget for the Community Services Block Grant Program. The Community Services Block Grant Program provides the infrastructure necessary to deliver services to 15 million of the lowest income people in our country. These are people who are hungry. When they are hungry, they go to the community action program. When they are homeless, they go to the community action program. When they do not have any money to buy food, they go to the community action program. The President proposes to cut back on that program, but he believes we have $826 million in tax breaks for the Nordstrom family.
   ""In addition, the former CEO of ExxonMobil does very well from the President's tax breaks. As I mentioned earlier, while the cost of gasoline was soaring, while the profits of ExxonMobil were soaring, the company decided, in its wisdom and generosity, to provide a $400 million retirement package for their departing CEO, Mr. Lee Raymond. Now, the President wants to reward Mr. Raymond by providing his estate with an estimated $164 million tax break. On the other hand, there is a program called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program which provides a package of high-quality, nutritious food to some 480,000 seniors, mothers, and children each and every month. The president wants to eliminate this program. He is saying to the 4,000 seniors in Vermont who benefit from this program, the almost half a million seniors, mothers, and kids who benefit from this package of food once a month: We in America don't have enough money to provide for you who are hungry, for you who are old. We can't do it. But if you are the former CEO of ExxonMobil, if you have a $400 million retirement package at the end of your career, guess what. Your family will get a $164 million tax break.
   ""As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, it appears to me that the choice we as a Congress are facing and that the American people are facing is pretty clear. Do we continue to shower huge tax breaks on millionaires and billionaires, people who are already doing phenomenally well, while we cut back on the needs of the middle-class working families and the most vulnerable people in this country?
   ""In my view, it all comes down to the phrase ""which side are we on."" Are we on the side of those people who make huge campaign contributions to Congress and the White House, or are we on the side of tens of millions of working families, struggling hard to keep their heads above water? That is the choice we face.
   ""And, that is why I am voting against Jim Nussle. Not because he is not smart, he is. Not because I don't like him, personally, I do. I am voting against Jim Nussle because I believe we should not give a break to the heirs of the Wal-Mart fortune. Rather, we should be fighting to substantially increase financial aid for low- and middle-class families so that every American, regardless of income, can receive a college education.
   ""We should not give another tax break to the former CEO of ExxonMobil and his family. Instead, we should be working to support working families all over this country who are desperately seeking quality and affordable childcare.
   ""I don't think that the heirs to the Mars Candy Bar fortune should get a tax break. In my view, it is far more important that we keep our promises to the veterans of this country who now find themselves on waiting lists to get the health care they need.
   ""If, as a nation, we are serious about addressing the long neglected needs of the middle-class and working people and creating a fairer and more egalitarian society, we have to invest in education, health care, housing, and our infrastructure. We have to deal with the crisis of global warming and sustainable energy, as well as many other areas. We also have to reduce our national debt. Given that reality, Congress must develop the courage to stand up to the big money interests, to the wealthiest families. We must roll back the tax breaks given to the wealthiest 1 percent, and we must demand that fortunate people rejoin American society and understand that like everybody else in this country, they are part of America and not a special breed. If we are to keep faith with our children, our seniors, our veterans, and with those people who have no health insurance, we can do no less.
   ""It seems very clear to me that we, as a nation, need to change our national priorities, and that the U.S. government should start paying attention to the struggling working families of our country rather than the powerful special interests who have so much power in Washington. We need a budget director who will remind the president that he is supposed to represent the interests of all Americans, and not just wealthy Republican campaign contributors.
   ""That is why I am voting against Jim Nussle.

1839,"SEN. SANDERS COMMENTS ON SENIOR ISSUES
  SENIOR ISSUES
   I am happy to announce today the formation of a Senior Advisory Council which will help me better understand and effectuate the needs of Vermont's senior citizens. The Council and I met earlier this morning and some of the issues we discussed included the need to strengthen senior centers in the state of Vermont by physically improving their facilities, increasing funding for the Older Americans Act, making sure that we protect the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, the congregate meal program and other nutritional programs.
   We also intend to work together on senior health issues, affordable housing and assisted living arrangements for seniors and transportation. Obviously, one of the ongoing issues facing seniors and all Americans is the high cost of prescription drugs - despite the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Program. 
   The unfortunate reality is that Americans continue to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Because of the escalating cost of medicines, many people do not get their prescriptions filled. That's just not right. It's time for Congress to act decisively to make sure every person in this country can afford the life-saving medicines that he or she needs.
   Let's be clear, the high price of prescription drugs is a financial burden that risks the health of seniors. Too many seniors cannot afford to buy their medications and must make decisions between the drugs that keep them well, the food they eat, or keeping their homes warm in the winter. This is a sad fact in the richest nation in the world.
   Congress can make a significant difference in the lives of seniors this year. By taking two common sense steps, the cost of medicines for our nation's seniors can be greatly reduced and we can see a great savings in taxpayer dollars.
   MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG NEGOTIATIONS
   1. However, the federal government has a great opportunity to force the pharmaceutical companies to lower prices. By using the enormous buying power of the government, Medicare can negotiate cheaper prices. But there is now a law that says they cannot. This is absurd. 
   2. Congress passed Medicare Part D three and a half years ago, creating a new prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   3. Unfortunately, this was a law written by the drug companies. And it has a major flaw, a big hole. Seniors must pay 25 percent of the cost for the first $2,400 of the cost of the medicine. Then seniors must pay all of the costs until their total out of pocket bill for medicines is $5,451. So seniors are caught in what is called the ""donut hole"" - the price range where covered seniors are forced to pay 100 percent of the cost of their medicines. 
   4. Meanwhile, the federal government is paying $44.7 billion a year for pharmaceuticals. 
   5. With some 22.5 million seniors and the disabled enrolled in the Medicare prescription plans, and more than 780 million prescriptions filled each year, Medicare could use that leverage to drive a better bargain and in the process save money for taxpayers and seniors. 
   6. The Veterans Administration is negotiating drug prices, and it does work. The VA pays less than Medicare for prescription drugs. A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study based on data from the mid-1990s found that average Veterans Affairs prices are less than 50 percent of the non-federal average manufacturer's price. Later, in 2000, the GAO reported that the Department of Defense and the VA paid prices for 21 brand-name drugs were up to 30 percent lower on average than those prices reported by Medicare.
  7. The issue is that Congress should have two goals: One, to save taxpayer money and, two, to use that savings to fill the hole that too many seniors are stuck in. 
   8. This is also the opinion of most Americans. A December poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 85 percent favor negotiations to lower prices. 
   9. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the Senate is blocking even consideration of this legislation. However, I will continue to press this issue and hope we will see a vote on this important opportunity later this spring. 
   PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG RE-IMPORTATION
   As the first member of Congress to take constituents across the border to highlight the huge difference in prices, I have seen first hand that Americans have to pay up to ten times more than people in other countries for exactly the same medicine.
   * Some of the women on the trip bought the medicine their doctor prescribed to treat breast cancer. At that time, the medicine cost around $150 a month in the United States. In Canada, they bought the same medicine, from the same company, made in the same factory, for just over $12.00. 
   * The drug companies have been fighting back hard with literally hundreds of lobbyists and tens and tens of millions of lobbying dollars and campaign contributions because they know this plan will lower the price of prescription drugs by 30 to 50 percent. 
   * Since 1998, the pharmaceutical industry has spent over $900 million on lobbying activities, more than any other industry. 
   * There are over 1,200 prescription drug lobbyists, more than two for every Member of Congress. 
   * Since 2000, the pharmaceutical companies have contributed almost $250 million in campaign contributions. 
   * It is not like the Drug Companies are hurting. According to Fortune Magazine, pharmaceutical companies are the 5th most profitable industry in the U.S. And Fortune also reports that the top 19 prescription drug companies in the United States made $42.1 billion in profits in 2005. 
   * And at a time when prescription drug costs are soaring, Henry McKinnel, the former CEO of Pfizer, walked away with a retirement package worth over $180 million. Meanwhile, the CEO of Eli Lilly made $32 million in total compensation and the CEO of Johnson & Johnson made $28 million in total compensation.

statement on the visit of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to the United States   I would like to extend my sincere welcome to the Honorable Kevin Rudd  who is making his first trip to the United States as the newly elected Prime Minister of Australia  This is a historic visit during a time of transition for both our nations    Earlier today  I spoke with Prime Minister Rudd  and congratulated him on his election as the first Labor Party prime minister in eleven years  I assured him of my personal commitment to maintaining a strong bilateral relationship between our nations in the years to come  and discussed our common interest in advancing peace and prosperity for the people of the United States  Australia  and the world    The alliance between the United States and Australia is deep and strong  and has stood the test of changing times  Labor Party leader John Curtain  along with President Franklin D  Roosevelt  established the U S  Australia alliance in 1942  Prime Minister Rudd s trip affirms the strategic value of this relationship and the friendship between our people  which has endured across generations and administrations    The U S  Australia alliance is a cornerstone of security and prosperity both in the Asia Pacific region and globally  Our two nations are bound by shared interests  shared values  and a common heritage    bonds that were forged in all major wars the United States was involved in during the 20th Century  a distinction unique to Australia    And  as a new century dawns  we are beginning to write a new and important chapter in the bilateral relationship   Indeed  during his first press conference the day after his election Prime Minister Rudd reiterated his strong commitment to the U S  Australia alliance  a deep commitment to a partnership of equals that I share   Like the United States  Australia is trans Pacific in orientation  and for this reason our perspectives and perceptions about regional and global affairs are often tightly aligned   The United States benefits from an Australia that can act as a regional leader in East Asia  but one with global interests and capabilities as well    The Prime Minister s visit provides an opportunity for the people of America to express our deep appreciation for Australia s contributions in combating al Qaeda   We will never forget that following the attacks on September 11  2001  Australia invoked the ANZUS treaty in support of the United States     Australia has deployed some 1000 troops in Afghanistan to the International Security Assistance Force  as well as about

5511  Lawmakers Make Renewable Fuels Availability  Energy Efficiency a Top Priority for New Congress  Sens  Obama  Harkin  Lugar  Biden  Dorgan  Introduce BioFuels Security Act   WASHINGTON  D C    On the first day of the new Congress  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Tom Harkin  D IA   Richard G  Lugar  R IN   Joseph R  Biden Jr   D DE  and Byron L  Dorgan  D ND  introduced legislation that will increase American drivers  access to ethanol at fuel pumps  Currently  the United States imports more than 60 percent of its oil  and our consumption continues to increase   further subjecting consumers to the whims of the world oil market  Over sixty percent of the world s oil reserves are held in the Middle East  handcuffing our foreign policy    American drivers can help reverse our oil dependence by filling up with ethanol blends like E85  85  ethanol  15  gas  or biodiesel  Increasing the use of ethanol will reduce our oil consumption and give us an environmentally friendly  domestically produced source of fuel   Today  Sens  Harkin  Lugar  Biden  Dorgan and Obama offered legislation  titled the BioFuels Security Act  to increase renewable fuels use through higher renewable fuels standards  RFS   greater availability of ethanol pumps and increased production of cars equipped to run on alternative fuel sources   The Renewable Fuels Standard is one of the most significant steps taken by Congress to increase ethanol production and decrease our nation s dangerous dependence on foreign oil   Senator Obama said   We should build off this success by increasing ethanol production  consumer access to renewable fuels  and the production of cars and trucks that can use them  It s time for Congress to realize what farmers in America s heartland have known all along   that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel  but what we ve been lacking is the political will       For too long  we ve depended on importing oil to meet our energy needs   Senator Harkin said   This legislation lays the roadmap to a long term ramp up in domestically produced renewable fuels  I believe if we are to attain national and economic security for our nation  we can and we must achieve these aggressive goals       I am pleased to join Senator Tom Harkin in re introducing the Biofuels Security Act in the 110th Congress  Our nation must take seriously our future energy security  and I am hopeful that this Congress will consider the merits of this aggressive  yet prudent  bi partisan legislation   Senator Lugar said     If it was not clear before  it is now   domestic energy policy is at the center of our foreign policy   said Senator Biden   For our own security   both nationally and globally    we have to begin the transition to alternative fuels  We can t do that without upgrading to a better system that combines protection for U S  automobile manufacturing jobs with increased use of alternative  home grown fuels   We have no choice but to get smarter with our energy policy      We must work towards requiring more use of ethanol and significant long term investment in renewable fuels to lead to a decrease of our nation s dependence on foreign sources of oil   said Senator Dorgan   This increase in ethanol production will expand job growth in the U S      The Renewable Fuels Standard is one of the most significant steps taken by Congress to increase ethanol production and decrease our nation s dangerous dependence on foreign oil   Senator Obama said   We should build off this success by increasing ethanol production  consumer access to renewable fuels  and the production of cars and trucks that can use them  It s time for Congress to realize what farmers in America s heartland have known all along   that we have the capacity and ingenuity to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by growing our own fuel  but what we ve been lacking is the political will     Specifically  the bill  Proposes a new renewable fuels standard  RFS  that calls for 60 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to be included in the United States motor vehicle fuel supply annually by the year 2030 by boosting ethanol and biodiesel production to 30 billion gallons annually by 2020  and then doubling that quantity over the following ten years to 60 billion gallons by 2030   Calls for increasing the number of gasoline stations that carry blends of 85  ethanol  E85   The bill would require large oil companies to install E85 pumps at their stations  increasing by five percentage points annually over the next 10 years  resulting in approximately 50  percent of all major brand gasoline stations nationwide having E85 pumps available within a decade   Directs automakers to gradually increase flex fuel vehicle  FFV  production  increasing in ten percentage point increments annually  until nearly all vehicles sold in the U S  are FFV s within 10 years  Currently  flex fuel vehicles    those able to use both regular gasoline and blends of up to 85 percent ethanol  E85    make up only about two percent of vehicles on the road                                   ,1
1785,"SEN. SANDERS: WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO BE AS AGGRESSIVE AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME
  The Senate failed to break a Republican filibuster of legislation to end the war in Iraq. The vote was 52 to 47, a bipartisan majority but still short of the 60 votes that were needed under Senate rules. ""The result was not a total shock, but we have to continue to be as aggressive as possible in order to bring our troops home as soon as possible,"" Sanders said. While the U.S. military has been focused on a savage civil war in Iraq, he noted, a new National Intelligence Estimate just made public concluded that six years after 9/11 that the threat of terrorist violence in the United States is growing worse and Osama bin Laden is and getting stronger.   
   Sanders was a cosponsor of the legislation that would order troops to start leaving in 120 days and complete the pullout by April 30, 2008. Under the bill, troops could remain to fight terrorists, protect U.S. assets and train Iraqi security forces. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blamed the outcome on ""dedicated obstructionists.""

Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  April 5  2006  Obama Calls on Energy Secretary to Let Stations Expand Access to Renewable Fuels Like E85 Effort to Greatly Increase Access to Renewable Fuels Stalled by IRS   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today asked Energy Secretary Samuel W  Bodman to affirm the Bush Administration s commitment to reducing our dependence on foreign oil by pressing the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  to immediately allow service stations to take advantage of a law that would greatly increase consumer access to renewable fuels like E85  Secretary Bodman will be in Peoria on Thursday    It has now been eight months since this bill became law  and I am frustrated that the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  has yet to make the tax credit available to station owners who want to sell alternative fuels   Obama wrote in a letter to Secretary Bodman   More frustrating still are reports that an initial IRS interpretation would only allow this tax credit to be used once a year by a taxpayer  even though I and other advocates of the provision intended the credit to be available to companies that own more than one service station and want to install alternative fuel equipment at multiple locations      Obama asked Secretary Bodman to use his leverage as Energy Secretary to pressure the IRS to correctly interpret legislation Obama strongly supported that would provide a tax credit of up to  30 000 for the installation of equipment that would allow fueling stations to offer alternative fuels  The legislation was signed into law last year but the IRS has yet to make the credit available to station owners    Obama said he is particularly concerned by initial IRS interpretations of the tax credit that would only allow it to be used once per year per individual  When Obama and other advocates wrote and supported this tax credit legislation last year  they clearly intended the credit to be used by companies owning more than one service station to install alternative fuel equipment at multiple locations    Obama asked Secretary Bodman to pledge to advocates of the tax credit and to farmers across Illinois who are already doing their part to lessen our dependence on foreign oil to support this legislation  It is estimated that the tax credit would triple the number of stations offering E85 in the first year after its implementation    It s time for the federal government to do its part to ensure that consumers who purchase flexible fuel vehicles have access to alternative fuels   Obama wrote   One way to accomplish this goal is for you to clearly state your support for an interpretation of the alternative fuels tax credit that encourages gas station chains to offer alternative fuels at all of their locations across the country     It is estimated that there are more than 4 million flexible fuel vehicles on the road today but only several hundred stations where E85 is sold      April 5  2006   The Honorable Samuel W  Bodman  Secretary  U S  Department of Energy  1000 Independence Ave   SW  Washington  DC  20585   Dear Secretary Bodman    Last August  President Bush signed into law the Energy Policy Act  which included a provision I advocated that would provide a tax credit of up to  30 000 for the installation of equipment to allow fueling stations to offer alternative fuels like E 85 to their customers    It has now been eight months since this bill became law  and I am frustrated that the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  has yet to make the tax credit available to station owners who want to sell alternative fuels   More frustrating still are reports that an initial IRS interpretation would only allow this tax credit to be used once a year by a taxpayer  even though I and other advocates of the provision intended the credit to be used by companies owning more than one service station that want to install alternative fuel equipment at multiple locations     During your visit to Peoria tomorrow  I hope you will assure me and the thousands of farmers across the state already doing their part to lessen our dependence on foreign oil that you share our commitment to alternative fuels   The U S  auto industry is also taking significant steps in this area by committing itself to producing hundreds of thousands of new flexible fuel vehicles  FFVs  in the coming years     Now it s time for the federal government to do its part to ensure that consumers who purchase FFVs have access to alternative fuels   One way to accomplish this goal is for you to clearly state your support for an interpretation of the alternative fuels tax credit that encourages gas station chains to offer such fuels at all of their locations across the country    I hope that you will commit to me and the people of Illinois that you will use your position as Secretary of Energy to encourage the IRS to interpret this law as it was intended and increase America s access to alternative fuels   Only then can we break what the President himself called America s  addiction  to foreign oil   Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator

1304,March 16  2006 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Calls on President Bush to do More to End the Genocide in Darfur

                   Washington  DC    Deeply concerned by the continuing genocide in Darfur  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has sent a letter to President Bush  urging him to take steps to protect civilians and address the crisis in Darfur   Senator Clinton  s letter emphasized her concern regarding continued violence against civilians and aid workers in Darfur  recent accounts of sexual violence against children  and escalating tensions between Sudan and Chad   Her letter reiterated the importance of a durable peace agreement between the conflicting parties  but emphasized that peace talks should not forestall efforts to ensure the safety of the people of Darfur            Earlier this month  Senator Clinton co sponsored a resolution that passed the Senate  which called on President Bush to arrange for increased NATO assistance in Darfur   In January  Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter to President Bush calling his attention to the crisis in Darfur          The full text of Senator Clinton s letter to President Bush follows          The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President          I write with great concern about the crisis in Sudan   Despite the work of the African Union  violence against civilians and aid workers in Darfur is increasing and spilling across the border into Chad   Between 200 000 and 400 000 people have been killed  and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and other credible experts continue to warn that three million civilians are displaced and at risk in Darfur and in eastern Chad   The situation in eastern Sudan is also of concern          The United States and United Nations  U N   now possess extensive  official accounts of the violence and  through a U N  Panel of Experts and other sources  we also know who may be responsible   The Government of Sudan    reported by the U S  State Department on March 8  2006 to be responsible for the genocide in Darfur    continues to deny the existence of a crisis   It continues to threaten retaliation against an international intervention  and  according to a U N  report dated January 30  2006  it continues to introduce additional military aircraft into Darfur  The United States can and must do more   Below are 13 ways in which you can take action       Convene a meeting of world leaders to address the crisis in Darfur  For 100 weeks  the international community has watched  with little meaningful response  as the first genocide of this millennium has been carried out by the Government of Sudan against the people of Darfur   I urge you to convene  without delay  a meeting between leaders of the United Nations  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO  and the African Union  and other interested world leaders  to map out an action plan for Darfur   The millions of displaced victims in Darfur deserve at least this much       Appoint a Presidential Envoy to Sudan   To promote lasting peace in both Darfur and eastern Sudan  and to demonstrate U S  commitment to peace negotiations and agreements  I urge you to consider the appointment of a Presidential Envoy to Sudan  Like Senator Danforth  your previous Envoy to Sudan  a new Envoy should participate personally in peace talks  oversee and coordinate U S  engagement in Sudan  and report directly to you on these efforts       Lead the U N  Security Council in authorizing a peacekeeping mission in Darfur  To protect civilians from continued violence    much of which is documented explicitly in a 42 page U N  report published on January 27 and the U N  Secretary General  s monthly reports to the Security Council    I urge you to push the U N  Security Council to authorize  under Chapter VII  a U N  peacekeeping mission in Darfur         On January 12 and March 10  2006  the African Union endorsed this mission in principle   U N  Secretary General Kofi Annan has begun planning this mission  in accordance with the U N  Security Council  s Presidential Statement of February 3  2006        Efforts to broker a peace agreement for Darfur must not forestall efforts to protect civilians   Our continued inaction will enable the killings to continue  This fact cannot be ignored        A U N  mission in Darfur must now be authorized with a clear and robust mandate to protect civilians  and be supplied with the troops  air  and ground mobility  and communications network required to fully implement that mandate        The Government of Sudan must either cooperate with this mission or face sanctions  in accordance with the existing U N  Security Council Resolutions that are described below       Support the African Union   According to U N  officials  deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur may take six to nine months   To protect civilians in the interim  I urge you to support the African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur in two ways   First  I urge you to support the funding needs of the African Union mission for the next nine months   As you know  the United States   share of these costs is estimated at         10 million per month        Second  in accordance with United States Senate Resolution 383  which I co sponsored  I urge you to lead NATO in providing assistance to the A U  peacekeepers in Darfur  particularly in the areas of command and control  logistics  intelligence  and airlift   I called for NATO assistance in Darfur more than 12 months ago  at the Munich Conference on Security   Since then  NATO has been helpful  particularly with airlift  but it can and should do more        Third  to improve the ability of the existing African Union peacekeepers to deter violence  I urge you to explore mechanisms that would provide African Union commanders in Darfur with specific  timely  standardized information about imminent attacks against civilians in Darfur       Enforce the no fly zone that has been established by the U N  Security Council and endorsed by the U S  Congress   Despite the enactment of a no fly zone by the U N  Security Council in March 2005    nearly one year ago    the Government of Sudan continues its aerial assaults against civilians in Darfur   This is unacceptable  and I urge you to work with members of NATO  the U N  Security Council  and the African Union to immediately enforce the ban on offensive overhead flights in Darfur that was established by Security Council Resolution 1591        On March 2  2006  the U S  Senate adopted Resolution 383 calling on you to take steps to enforce the no fly zone in Darfur   Senator Biden and others have suggested that enforcement of the flight ban would require no more than 12 to 18 fighter planes and a handful of AWACs   I urge you to work other countries to mobilize these resources  and to ensure that the Government of Sudan ceases its overhead assaults   Our continued failure on this issue is unacceptable        Similarly  I urge you to raise with Khartoum the findings of a U N  report dated January 30  2006  which suggest that the Government of Sudan continues to introduce additional offensive military aircraft into Darfur       Lead the U N  Security Council in enforcing Resolution 1591  to freeze the assets and travel of certain dangerous individuals   I urge you to work with other members of the U N  Security Council to fully implement Resolution 1591  which authorized the Security Council to impose travel bans and asset freezes on any individuals believed by a Panel of Experts to constitute a threat to stability  to violate international human rights law  to impede the peace process  or to conduct offensive overhead military flights        The Panel of Experts has identified several individuals who have perpetrated such violations of international law  and these individuals must be prevented from organizing or perpetrating additional violence  and be sanctioned in full accordance with Resolution 1591   At the very least  the Security Council should call the named individuals to the United Nations for dialogue and questioning        Lead the U N  Security Council in enforcing Resolution 1564  to hold accountable the Government of Sudan for its documented failure to meet its international obligations to end violence and protect civilians in Darfur   I urge you to work with the U N  Security Council to fully implement Resolution 1564  which calls on the Security Council to consider   additional measures as contemplated in Article 41 of the Charter of the United Nations  such as actions to affect Sudan  s petroleum sector and the Government of Sudan or individual members of the Government of Sudan     if the Government of Sudan fails its previous obligations under international law  including U N  Security Council Resolution 1556 and the Joint Communiqu     dated July 3  2004        Several official reports  including a U N  report published on January 27  2006  demonstrate unequivocally that the Government of Sudan has failed its obligations   It has failed to protect civilians in Darfur  and it has failed to punish members of the military and the Janjaweed for violations of international human rights law   These realities and Resolution 1564 should now compel the Security Council to consider Article 41 measures against the Government of Sudan       Ensure that the U N  Security Council listens to the experts   I urge you to convene a briefing for members of the Security Council by experts who can describe the situation in Darfur  eastern Chad  and eastern Sudan   The Security Council should hear testimony from Juan Mendez  Special Advisor to the Secretary General on the Prevention of Genocide   As you know  the Security Council did not allow Mr  Mendez to present his observations in October 2005       Stop the violence from spreading into Chad   I urge you to monitor tensions along the Chad Sudan border and to focus the U N  Security Council on this important issue   The U N  Secretary General noted in his January 30 report to the Security Council that   there has been a worrying build up of armed forces of the two States and local militias on both sides of the border     and that   it is vitally important that the situation in the border areas of Chad and the conflicts in the Sudan do not combine to propel the two countries and the whole region towards confrontation and conflict           More specifically  I urge you to work with the Security Council and the African Union to monitor implementation of the February 8  2006 accord between the Presidents of Chad and Sudan  and to deter all parties from escalating the conflict   The safety of at least three million civilians along the Chad Sudan border depends on your attention to this issue       Call publicly for better behavior from Khartoum   Using Resolutions 1591 and 1564 and other points of leverage  I urge you to call on the Government of Sudan    particularly the National Congress Party in Khartoum    to immediately desist from violence against civilians  protect safe passage for aid workers  cooperate fully with international peacekeepers  engage constructively in the peace talks in Abuja  diffuse tensions along the Chad Sudan border  and disarm and punish the Janjaweed and other groups responsible for genocidal violence in Darfur        I urge you to call similarly on the Government of Sudan to implement the Comprehensive Peace Agreement without delay and in full consultation with the Government of Southern Sudan  and to protect civilians and peacefully address the situation in eastern Sudan       Work with the U N  Security Council to address attacks by rebel groups in Darfur   I urge you to work with the Security Council to make it clear to all rebels and perpetrators of violence in Sudan and Chad that attacks against civilians and aid workers are violations of international law  and that continued international consideration of their grievances depends directly upon their immediate cessation of violence against civilians        Plan for reconstruction in Darfur   Through a new Presidential Envoy or other U S  officials  I urge you to begin working with the World Bank and other stakeholders on a Joint Assessment Mission to plan for reconstruction in Darfur   This may help to accelerate the peace process by demonstrating to the Darfur rebels and the Government of Sudan that peace can bring financial dividends  and  once peace has been established  it will help to speed reconstruction and promote stability       Support reconstruction in southern Sudan   I urge you to provide strong  material support to the Government of Southern Sudan as it builds a stable state  economy  and society in the wake of decades of conflict  Similarly  I urge you to encourage the Government of Southern Sudan to engage constructively in the Darfur peace negotiations        During the last century  in Nazi Europe  Cambodia  and elsewhere  the international community failed to protect millions of innocent people from genocide and horrific crimes  We look back and wonder how the world allowed those killings to continue   We must find a way to protect civilians in Darfur  without further delay        As you know  I and other members of the U S  Congress recognized the genocide in Darfur in July 2004   In September 2004  then Secretary of State Colin Powell did the same   A few months later  in January 2005  a U N  International Commission of Inquiry established by U N  Security Council Resolution 1564 also found strong evidence of genocide in Darfur   In February 2006  Secretary of State Rice said that   genocide was committed and in fact continues in Darfur      Even so  international agreement on the existence of genocide has little connection to the need or basis for action        Hundreds of acts of violence in Darfur  many constituting crimes against humanity and war crimes    along with specific descriptions of the perpetrators    have been recorded in detail by the U S  State Department  the United Nations  the African Union  the NGO community  and other organizations   I urge you to read these gruesome accounts  and to also review the list of individuals who have been identified by the U N  Panel of Experts established by U N  Security Council Resolution 1591   In the case of Darfur  we are now obligated by the U N  Charter  the Responsibility to Protect  several statutes of international human rights law  and existing U N  Security Council resolutions to transform our awareness into action        Therefore  I urge you  as President of the United States  to remind the international community of its commitments and to work urgently with the United Nations  the African Union  and NATO to protect civilians and address the growing crises in Darfur  eastern Chad  and eastern Sudan   Thank you for your attention to these urgent matters        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton         CC  John R  Bolton         United States Permanent Representative           to the United Nations               ,0
1790,"SEN. SANDERS: THE LESSON OF BLACKWATER
  It is time to rethink the privatization of the United States military. In Iraq alone, there are roughly 180,000 private contractors working for American government agencies, including about 30,000 heavily-armed guards. The most notorious contractor, Blackwater USA, has been embroiled in controversy over the deaths last month of 17 Iraqis. A State Department contract with the private security firm, which escorts U.S. diplomats traveling outside the heavily protected Green Zone in Baghdad, expires in May. The contract should not be renewed, Senator Bernie Sanders said.  
   Sanders said he would work with other members of the Senate and House in taking a hard look at the role of private contractors in the military. 
   ""The Bush administration has made radical and dangerous changes in the structure of our military, and Congress needs to take a very hard look at that. 
   ""To my mind, it is wrong and unacceptable for companies like Blackwater to operate outside of the chain of command of the United States military and United States government in Iraq. 
   ""I also find it troubling when personnel employed by a company like Blackwater who are paid far more than soldiers in the U.S. military who are putting their lives on the line every day.""

1719,"SEN. SANDERS: PROTECTING TROOPS OR PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT?
  An amendment cosponsored by Senator Bernie Sanders to give U.S. troops longer rest periods between combat deployments in Iraq fell victim to a Republican filibuster. ""The war in Iraq has been devastating in so many areas, not least of all the impact on our soldiers and their families,"" Sanders said. ""It is unconscionable that we are sending not only active duty troops, but members of National Guard and Reserve units that are already stretched thin, back to the war zone over and over again. It is an outrage that Republican senators care more about protecting the president than protecting our troops."" 
   The Senate vote was 56-to-41, four short of the number needed to end debate on the amendment by Senator Jim Webb to the defense authorization bill. Cosponsored by Sanders and others, the measure would have made leaves between deployments last at least as long as combat tours. For the National Guard and Reserves, no unit or member could be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of their previous deployment.
   Repeated tours are hurting recruitment, driving up attrition rates in the military, depressing recruitment and depleting units of vital equipment.
   It was the fifth time this year that Senate Republicans effectively blocked an effort to change U.S. policy in Iraq. Despite increasing public criticism of President Bush's war strategy, only seven Republicans supported the troop deployment amendment.

1871,"SEN. SANDERS AMENDMENT TO PROHIBIT COMPANIES FROM HIRING TEMPORARY GUEST WORKERS IF THEY RECENTLY FIRED U.S. WORKERS
  Immigration legislation now before the Senate would let employers in the United States drive down the wages and benefits of U.S. workers by importing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of guest workers from other countries. An amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders would prohibit companies from hiring temporary guest workers if they recently laid-off or fired U.S. workers. Now, he wants a Labor Department investigation into job cuts at a Vermont ski resort.  
   The Rutland Herald first disclosed this week that Powdr Corp, the new owner of the Killington and Pico ski resorts, fired a significant number of full-time workers. Sanders asked Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to investigate. Killington Ltd., which recently sold the resort, had secured visas to bring in about 180 foreign athletic trainers, instructors, tow lift operators, snowmaker operators and housecleaners.

                         Obama Says Disaster Evacuation Plans Must Account for Society   s Most Vulnerable Monday  September 12  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 12  2005  Obama Says Disaster Evacuation Plans Must Account for Society s Most Vulnerable    WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced legislation that would require states to prepare disaster evacuation plans that account for the needs of society s most vulnerable members  including the poor  the disabled and the elderly    It is the duty of our government to keep all Americans safe in times of emergency  especially those in our society who are not always able to help themselves   said Obama   But in the days and weeks since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast  it has become overwhelmingly clear that this was not the case  The government did not adequately prepare to evacuate those who could not afford a car  did not adequately prepare to evacuate the elderly  and did not adequately prepare to evacuate those who were too sick to leave their beds     It has been widely reported that the Hurricane Katrina evacuation plan did not adequately account for the special needs of low income populations  Obama s bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to mandate that each state include plans for the evacuation of individuals with special needs during times of emergency  These people would include low income individuals and families  the elderly  the disabled  and those who cannot speak English  The plans must consider how these people would be evacuated out of the emergency area but also how the states would provide shelter  food  and water to these people once they are evacuated  Obama s bill would require that the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security report each state s evacuation plan within one year after the legislation becomes law    What we saw in the Gulf Coast cannot be repeated   said Obama   We may not be able to control the wrath of Mother Nature  but we can control how we prepare for natural disasters     The bill is cosponsored by Senators Evan Bayh  D IN   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Jon Corzine  D NJ   Russ Feingold  D WI   Tom Harkin  D IA   Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  and Carl Levin  D MI     Obama was also joined by 18 other Senate Democrats in a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff asking that the Secretary ensure all evacuation plans include consideration for those in our society who are the most vulnerable  Please find full text of the letter below      September 9  2005    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Nebraska Avenue Center  NW  Washington  DC 20528  Dear Secretary Chertoff  One of the most striking aspects of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina is that the majority of stranded victims were our society s most vulnerable members   low income families  the elderly  the homeless  the disabled  or non English speaking individuals   Many did not own cars   Many believed themselves unable to flee the city  unable to forego the income from missed work  unable to incur the expenses of travel  food  and lodging   Some may have misunderstood the severity of the warnings  if they heard the warnings at all   Some may have needed help that was unavailable   Whatever the reason  they were not evacuated and we have seen the horrific results  It appears that certain assumptions were made in planning and preparing for the worst case scenario in New Orleans   After all  most of those who could afford to evacuate managed to do so   They drove out of town and checked into hotels or stayed with friends and family   But what about the thousands of people left behind because they had special needs  Our charge as public servants is to worry about all of the people   We are troubled that our emergency response and disaster plans were apparently inadequate for large segments of the Gulf Coast population   We wonder whether the plans in other regions are similarly inadequate   Perfect evacuation planning is obviously impractical  but greater advance preparation can ensure that the most vulnerable are not simply forgotten or ignored  We urge you to develop a process by which all emergency planning efforts address the unique challenges of evacuating and or delivering emergency services to people with special needs   Questions that the Department needs to address include  Is there a transportation strategy for those without private vehicles  or funds for alternative private travel  Is there a temporary relocation strategy for those who cannot afford hotels or who have no nearby relatives with whom to reside  Are there adequate stockpiles of food  water  and medicine accessible to low income and special needs communities  or plans for immediate delivery  Do emergency professionals have the training and equipment required to assist people with mental or physical disabilities  Is there a strategy for ensuring that the millions of unauthorized immigrants in the country participate in evacuations free from fear of incarceration or deportation  Is there an adequate communication strategy for those without sufficient English or reading ability  or for the visually and hearing impaired  Communities with special needs may be more challenging to accommodate  but they are every bit as important to protect and serve in the event of an emergency   And though we cannot condone unauthorized immigration  we cannot have this population evading law enforcement during a crisis  We request that you provide information to us on the steps that the Department and its subsidiary agencies are taking to ensure that emergency planning at all levels is improved in this important way  Thank you for your attention to this matter  Sincerely  U S  Senator Barack Obama                                  ,1
461,   Durbin  Obama  Costello Request Meeting with VA Secretary to Discuss Marion VA    U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Durbin  Obama  Costello Request Meeting with VA Secretary to Discuss Marion VA  Tuesday  May 27  2008  For Immediate Release  Contact  Christina Mulka  Durbin   Michael Ortiz  Obama   or David Gillies  Costello  Senators ask for explanation of ABI investigation delay  WASHINGTON  D C    Two weeks after the Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC  in Marion  Illinois resumed outpatient surgeries  U S  Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Barack Obama  D IL  and Representative Jerry Costello  D IL  today requested a meeting with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  James Peake  to discuss the progress at the Marion facility   The Senators are asking for an update on the status of a pending Administrative Board of Investigation  ABI  report at the Marion facility to determine which individuals were responsible for allowing a decline in the quality of patient care  including nine deaths as a result of substandard care    As surgical procedures restart in Marion  it is important that we continue to work toward returning the VAMC to a full service medical facility   said Durbin    This can not be done before the conclusion of the ABI report and without a permanent leadership team in place   I expect the VA to make every effort to finish this report and implement the recommendations as soon as possible    Our nation s veterans should expect nothing less than the best care and treatment at veterans  facilities in Illinois and throughout the United States   said Obama   After last year s unacceptable tragedies at the Marion VA  we must do everything we can to guarantee that the VA maintains the highest standards for its medical personnel and operations  Our veterans must not be put in danger when they are seeking help  I am committed to working with Senator Durbin  my Illinois colleagues  and Secretary Peake to ensure this facility is once again capable of providing our veterans with the quality medical attention they deserve    While some progress is being made at Marion  there are still many questions that need to be answered   said Costello    A full public accounting of the problems at the facility needs to be made by the VA in order to move forward   In a February 19  2008 letter  Secretary Peake informed Senator Durbin that the ABI was interviewing VA employees and would complete its final report in April   Despite multiple inquires into the status of the ABI s final report no revised completion date has been offered   On May 8  the VAMC facility in Marion  Illinois resumed low risk  outpatient surgeries that had been suspended in August 2007 after an apparent spike in post surgical deaths     May 27  2008 The Honorable James B  Peake  M D    Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20420 Dear Secretary Peake  We are writing to urge the completion and release of the pending investigation at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center  VAMC  in Marion  Illinois  and request a meeting with you to discuss the situation there  For many years  veterans from Illinois  Indiana  and Kentucky have given high grades to the Marion VAMC   The men and women who work at the hospital today are committed to continuing to provide high quality care for our veterans  Unfortunately  poor leadership and communication led to serious problems at the facility last year  including surgical malfeasance associated with the deaths of nine veterans   The Veterans Administration  VA  reassigned five individuals  including the VAMC director  chief of staff  and chief of surgery  to non clinical areas after concerns about the quality of patient care at the facility arose in 2007  The reassignments became effective as early as September 14 of last year   After a three month delay  the VA convened an Administrative Board of Investigation  ABI  to determine which individuals at the Marion VAMC were responsible for allowing these serious problems to continue  In a February 19  2008 letter  you informed Senator Durbin that the ABI was interviewing VA employees and would complete its final report in April   That date has passed   Our staff has contacted your office on multiple occasions to inquire into the status of the ABI s final report   Your office has been unable to offer a completion date  We are also concerned that veterans are being asked to travel for surgical operations that once were available to them in Marion   While we are pleased that the VAMC resumed minor outpatient surgeries on May 8  we are looking for more information from you on the plans for returning the Marion VAMC to a full service medical facility  We request a meeting with you at your earliest availability to discuss the completion of the ABI report  the progress in hiring permanent hospital leadership  and the return of the high quality of care for which the Marion VAMC has historically been known    Sincerely                                Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1
767,November 10  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on President Bush to Raise Human Rights Issues with Chinese Government During Visit to China                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senator Makes Announcement at ABA International Rule of Law Symposium                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    During a keynote address at the American Bar Association International Rule of Law Symposium  Senator Clinton announced that she is sending a letter to President Bush urging him to raise critical human rights issues in his upcoming meetings with the Chinese government during his visit to the People  s Republic of China          Specifically  Senator Clinton encouraged the President in her letter to                     Make clear that the United States strongly opposes human rights abuses that have occurred as a result of China  s one child  policy  supports non coercive family planning programs  and wants China to end any population policies that violate human rights                   Emphasize the importance of freedom of religion and conscience  and to urge China to end any repressive practices                   Press China to respect the unique religious  linguistic  and cultural heritage of the Tibetan people and to fully respect their human rights and civil liberties                   Stress U S  concerns over China  s repression of workers   rights           The text of Senator Clinton  s letter to President Bush is below          Senator Clinton  s speech before the ABA symposium focused on the international        rule of law and promoting women  s rights   Noting that the rule of law    provides the foundation for democratic freedom  peace and stability  and economic growth     Senator Clinton applauded the symposium  s efforts to create an international rule of law movement   She noted that to keep such a movement moving forward for women  we must promote   education for all  so that women and men know their rights and are empowered to act on them   Better health care and law enforcement  so that women and men have the resources to keep themselves and their families healthy   And we need to keep fighting to end the scourge of trafficking in persons             Senator Clinton also stated that when   we talk about promoting the rule of law in other societies  we need to begin by recognizing that the United States has a special heritage and a special responsibility      From our own women  s rights movement to the shining examples of women like Rosa Parks  the U S  tradition of using the rule of law to right the wrongs of the law has inspired millions around the world               November 10  2005         The Honorable George Bush       President of the United States       Washington  D C  20500         Dear Mr  President                   This month you will visit the People  s Republic of China to meet with the leadership of that nation   These summit meetings provide an opportunity for the United States and China to discuss a wide range of important issues   During your meetings  I urge you to raise human rights issues with the Chinese government and emphasize that respect for human rights is a critically important element in the U S  China relationship   Specifically  I hope you will raise with the Chinese government the following points                   Since first introduced in 1979  China  s one child policy has evoked strong concern over human rights abuses   These abuses have reportedly included denial of social benefits  fines  detention  destruction of property  forced abortion and forced sterilization   Such practices reflect the fundamental injustice inherent in a system that interposes government in choices that should be made by women and their families   In 1995  as a participant in the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing  I heard first hand about these practices and spoke against them   In 2002  China enacted a Population and Family Planning Law aimed at ending human rights violations associated with the one child policy   However  the 2004 State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices suggests uneven Chinese enforcement of the law  with continuing use of psychological and economic pressure and threats to force women to terminate pregnancies or undergo sterilization   I urge you to make clear the United States strongly opposes these abuses  supports non coercive family planning programs  and wants China to end any population policies that violate human rights                   In addition  although the Chinese Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief  in reality the Government works to restrict religious practice to government sanctioned organizations and registered places of worship   Unregistered religious groups are subjected to varying levels of intimidation  harassment and detention   Since 1999  the Secretary of State has designated China as a   Country of Particular Concern    under the International Religious Freedom Act for its severe violations of religious freedom   You raised the issue of religious freedom during your December 2003 meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao and November 2004 meeting with President Hu Jintao   However  the 2005 State Department International Religious Freedom Report still rates China  s respect for freedom of religion and conscience as   poor    and the November 2005 U S  Commission on International Religious Freedom  s Policy Focus on China report found that   the Chinese government systematically violates the right to freedom of thought  conscience  and religion or belief  contravening both the Chinese constitution and international human rights norms      I ask you to raise this matter again with China  to emphasize the importance of freedom of religion and conscience  and to urge China to end any repressive practices                   As you know the United States continues to press China to respect the unique religious  linguistic  and cultural heritage of the Tibetan people and to fully respect their human rights and civil liberties   In 2001  I was pleased to co sponsor the Tibetan Policy Act to support substantive dialogue between the Government of the People  s Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives and to strengthen the capacity of the United States Government to promote such dialogue   The United States has raised the issue of Tibet with China on a number of occasions  most recently during Secretary Rice  s July 2005 visit   I urge you to again bring this longstanding and pressing matter to the attention of China and to prompt them to achieve a fair resolution          Finally  regarding worker  s rights  eighteen months after rejecting the AFL CIO s Section 301 petition alleging China s repression of workers  rights was an unfair trade practice  the Bush Administration has yet to progress in raising the issue with China   The Chinese government has failed to make any significant reforms  either in its labor laws or enforcement practices   As the bilateral trade deficit with China soars  and American workers lose manufacturing jobs  employers take advantage of Chinese workers who cannot exercise their right to form independent unions and bargain   Unfortunately  the only concrete outcome of the high profile visit by Secretary Chao to China in the summer of 2004 was a series of letters pledging more seminars  high level visits  and dialogues on workplace issues  But this dialogue has yielded few  if any  tangible results  on issues of crucial importance  both to Chinese and American workers   U S  concerns over worker  s rights should be re emphasized during this summit                   I strongly support continuing efforts to improve the relationship on all levels between our country and China   It is to our mutual benefit to work together to address the range of challenges facing both of us   However  economic and social advances will be lasting only if they are built on a foundation of respect for human rights                    Thank you for your consideration            Sincerely              Hillary Rodham Clinton              ,0
1918,"SEN. SANDERS CALLS CONGRESS TO ADOPT SMARTER TRADE POLICIES, ENACT HEALTH CARE REFORM, EXPAND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES ON LABOR DAY
  As Americans observe Labor Day, Senator Bernie Sanders called on Congress to adopt smarter trade policies, enact health care reform, and expand education opportunities to help working people. The senator also challenged President Bush's assessment of the economy. ""President Bush repeatedly says the economy is 'strong and getting stronger,' 'thriving,' 'robust,' 'solid,' 'booming,' 'healthy,' 'powerful,' 'fantastic,' 'exciting,' 'amazing' and 'the envy of the world,' "" Sanders said, ""and, to a certain extent, he has a point. The richest people in our country are doing phenomenally well. But what the president has got to understand is that not everyone in America is a millionaire or billionaire, and that millions of working Americans are struggling hard to keep their heads above water."" The senator was joined at a discussion about economic realities confronting Americans and Vermonters by James Haslam, director of the Vermont Workers' Center, and University of Vermont Associate Dean Stephanie Seguino. 
   ""On this Labor Day weekend, most American workers have not shared in the growth and prosperity they have been helping to create. For these families, there is no possibility for money left over at the end of the month. For them, there is a lot of month left at the end of the paycheck,"" Professor Seguino said. 
   Added James Haslam of the Vermont Workers' Center: ""Labor Day has lost mush of its original meaning. A day once set aside to pay tribute to the achievements of working people now has more to do with shopping at big-box stores than with honoring the labor movement - the folks that brought you the weekend."" 
   Senator Sanders pointed out that since President Bush took office:
   * Nearly 5 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty; 
   * 8.6 million Americans have lost their health insurance, bringing the total to 47 million. 
   * From 2001 to 2005, as the rich getting richer and the middle class shrinks, the top 1 percent of households saw a $183,902 increase per household income while the bottom 90 percent saw a $2,071 loss of total income. The top 300,000 Americans now earn nearly as much income as the bottom 150 million Americans combined. 
   * Over 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost and the major auto companies are now threatening to leave the United States if workers do not take a major wage cut.; 
   * 3 million American workers have lost their pensions; 
   * Home foreclosures are now the highest on record; 
   * The personal savings rate is below zero, which hasn't happened since the Great Depression; 
   * The real earnings of college graduates have gone down by roughly five percent from 2000-2004; 
   * Entry level wages for male and female high school graduates have fallen by about 3.3 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively; and 
   * Wages and salaries are now at their lowest share of GDP since 1929. 
   In addition, the United States today has the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of any major country on Earth. In 2005, while average incomes for the bottom 90 percent of Americans declined by $172, the wealthiest 1/100th of 1 percent reported an average income of $25.7 million, a 1-year increase of $4.4 million. The top 1 percent of Americans received, in 2005, the largest share of national income since 1928. According to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the wealthiest 400 Americans increased by $120 billion last year to $1.25 trillion. 
   ""Now, to me, that does not sound like a robust, booming, or strong economy,"" Sanders said, ""and, the American people understand this very clearly."" In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll published last month, more than two-thirds of Americans believe the U.S. economy is either in recession now or will be in the next year.
   As Congress returns from its August break, Sanders said, ""it's clear that we have got to focus on the economic needs of the middle class and working families, and not just the wealthy and people. 
   He highlighted three areas he intends concentrate on a national health care program for all Americans; reform of our trade policies so that corporate America invests in this country, and not just in China and other low wage countries, and realignment of national priorities so that we adequately fund education, from pre-school to graduate school so that all Americans, regardless of income, can compete effectively in the global economy. 
   For her part, Professor Seguino added:
    ""Despite the fact that Americans are working longer hours and harder -that is more productively, wages are lagging. They are not receiving a proportionate share of the increased productivity. The wages of production workers has risen 3.5 percent since 2001. During that time, however worker productivity increased 20 percent. Much of the productivity growth fuelled profits of corporations, dividends of shareholders, and CEO pay. For them, this has been a golden era. 
   ""For average working Americans, stagnant and falling wages have to be stretched still further. Rising house costs accompanied by a foreclosure crisis, steadily increasing costs of medicine and health care, and the rising price of oil mean the many who have worked very hard, are struggling to make ends meet. Many in fact simply do not make a living wage. A single parent raising one child in Vermont would have to earn $21.40 to meet the family's basic needs--to cover out of pocket health care costs, modest housing, food and transportation. This is almost 300 percent greater than the actual minimum wage in Vermont--already one of the highest in the country at $7.53 an hour. One out of four full-time workers earn less than a livable wage for a single person. 
   ""The bad economic news weighs most heavily on women and people of color. Over one-third of women and 36 percent of people of color do not earn a livable wage in Vermont--double that of white men. How do families get by? They forgo necessities, such as health care. And they compensate by spending more time working. But this has led to a crisis of care. The longer work hours hurts the time parents have to spend with their children, helping them with homework. It puts them in a double bind if they must also provide care at home to elderly or ill family members. Nor are benefits rising to compensate for stagnant wages. In fact the opposite is occurring. 
   ""The share of private sector workers with a pension dropped from 50.3 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2005. 
   ""The share of people with employer-provided health insurance has fallen, so that the number of Americans without health care coverage is up to 47 million. That is 8.5 million uninsured Americans since 2000.
   ""If we used the measure official poverty--roughly $20,000 a year for a family of five, we find that 5 million more families live in poverty today than in 2000. Children remain, by far, the poorest age group. The poverty rate remains 20 percent for children under age six. For children in families of color, the poverty is more than double that of white children, at over 40 percent. This underscores that economic growth alone--especially when the benefits are not evenly shared--will not be enough to make meaningful progress in reducing poverty. 
   ""Contrast the economic stresses felt by most working American to this golden era for economic elites. Those with incomes of more than $1 million a year garnered almost half the total income gains in 2005. And, ALL of the income gains in 2005 went to the top 10 percent of households, while the bottom 90 percent of households saw income declines.""
   And Mr. Haslam recalled the history of the labor movement.
   ""In 1882, when the first Labor Day was celebrated in New York City, workers were fighting for the eight-hour day because they believed people should have time to spend with their families. Vermont farm girls who had gone to work in the textile sweatshops in Massachusetts were among 30,000 women and girls - many of them immigrants - who rebelled in the 1912 'Bread & Roses' strike. 
   ""Workers' action ended child labor. Free speech, the right to vote, the right to organize and public education for all were won through struggle. Barre granite workers' history shows us we had to fight for safe, dignified work lives. Winning improved consitions in workplaces and in our communities didn't come easy. In the face of deportations, physical and economic violence we overcame temporary defeats through solidarity and mobilizing the community to win economic justice. This is our history, which we do a great disservice to ourselves to ignore.

661,   Obama  McCaskill Introduce Bill to Evaluate Needs of Returning Service Members   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  McCaskill Introduce Bill to Evaluate Needs of Returning Service Members Wednesday  May  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Ben LaBolt  Would ensure physical and mental health conditions  readjustment priorities are addressed WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  today introduced the Homecoming Enhancement Research and Oversight  HERO  Act  legislation that would launch a comprehensive research endeavor to evaluate the physical  mental health  and readjustment needs of service members returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan   Between family commitments  widespread traumatic brain injuries and mental health disorders  and multiple redeployments  today   s service members and their families face a unique set of needs that must be identified and addressed      Caring for our returning service members is one thing we can still get right about this war     said Senator Obama      We must ensure that we give our service members  veterans and their families receive the treatment  care  and assistance they need to rebuild their lives   The challenges do not diminish for many service members when they return home because the legacy of war takes a physical and emotional toll   As we bring this war to a resolution  it   s our duty to honor the commitment of these heroes by meeting their long term needs          Those who have fought this war and felt its effects most personally  our servicemen and women  deserve to have a real researched plan for dealing with the aftermath of their sacrifice  so that the mistakes made by the administration in war planning are not repeated in planning for the readjustment needs of these heroes     Senator McCaskill said      Such a comprehensive research effort proved invaluable for Vietnam veterans but came ten years late  We need to deliver the same level of analysis and planning for today   s veterans right now     After many Vietnam veterans had difficulty readjusting when they returned from war  a national Vietnam veterans study was conducted to evaluate their needs  but it was completed more than a decade after the war ended   This war has been described as a    family war      According to the American Psychological Association  60  of deployed service members have family responsibilities  and at any given time  some 500 000 children have at least one parent deployed   There is a lack of research focused on mental health and other readjustment needs of returning service members  including service connected PTSD and increasingly complex Traumatic Brain Injuries  The Hero Act would direct the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to launch a national research study which would achieve the following in two phases  Phase One Research  completed in 180 days  Preliminary findings on the mental health and adjustment needs as well as gaps in care facing service members  veterans and their families   Description of research tracks and parameters for Phase Two research  Phase Two Research  completed in 3 years   An assessment of the psychological  social and economic impacts of deployments on service members  veterans and their families  including the particular impacts of multiple extended deployments and the long term effects of untreated physical and mental health disorders  such as PTSD    An assessment of the particular needs and concerns of female members of the Armed Forces and female veterans An assessment of the particular needs and concerns of minority members of the Armed Forces and minority veterans   An assessment of the particular educational and vocational needs of returning service members  veterans and their families   An assessment of the full scope of the effects of TBIs on service members and former members  including effects on the family members and caregivers  and efficacy and accessibility of current treatment options within the DOD and VA   Recommendations  based on Phase Two findings  of remedies or strategies to prevent  minimize or address the impacts  needs and gaps in care identified  Follow Up Action Planning  The VA and DOD must submit joint planning documents  with cost estimates  which respond to the NAS findings  and the GAO will audit these documents  The Hero Act has been endorsed by Veterans for America  Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  Coalition to Salute America   s Heroes and the Brain Injury Association of America  Senators Obama and McCaskill also sponsored the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act  which takes a comprehensive approach to improving treatment for returning service members  from improving facilities  to increasing caseworkers and counselors and easing the transition from the DoD to the VA   Senator Obama is also the sponsor of the Lane Evans Veterans Health and Benefits Improvement Act  which would make veterans who served on active duty during a period of war eligible for a mental health evaluation and provide hospital care  medical services  nursing home care  and family and marital counseling for any identified mental health condition                                   ,1

1333,October 16  2006 Senator Clinton Releases Seasonal Flu Vaccine Guide to Help New Yorkers Locate Flu Vaccine

                     Calls on CDC to Address Continued Failure to Establish Vaccine Tracking System Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today released her third annual Seasonal Flu Vaccine Resource Guide to help New Yorkers get the assistance they need in locating flu vaccines   She also sent a letter to Dr  Julie Gerberding  Director of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   urging her to improve the agency  s efforts to track seasonal influenza vaccines              At a time when we routinely use tracking to trace deliveries of other goods in the private market  we still cannot accurately predict when a vaccine order might be delivered to a provider     said Senator Clinton     With a tracking system in place  we could better trace the distribution of vaccine from the factory to the provider  allowing us to easily determine where vaccine shortages are occurring and speed vaccine to those areas   All of this could take place in a matter of hours  instead of days or weeks             This year  reports indicate that over 100 million doses of flu vaccine will be made available nationwide  making it easier for seniors  those with chronic illness  and others at risk for complications from the flu to protect themselves   To help New Yorkers locate flu vaccines  Senator Clinton is making available a special resource guide on her website at www clinton senate gov   The guide provides a list of agencies that offer assistance in finding seasonal flu vaccine throughout New York State   New Yorkers will also find information on seasonal flu  the CDC  s priority groups for vaccination and tips to protect them from seasonal flu          Senator Clinton has led the charge to address persistent problems in seasonal flu vaccine distribution   Senator Clinton has introduced the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Pat Roberts  which will help create a stable flu vaccine market by increasing research into safer  faster  and more reliable methods of vaccine production and establishing a tracking system so the federal government and state and local health departments can gather and share the information they need to ensure that high priority populations will have access to vaccines   It will also increase educational efforts to improve flu vaccination rates  and strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza   Senator Clinton has emphasized that shoring up our seasonal flu vaccine delivery system is critical not only to adequately respond to the regular  annual occurrence of seasonal flu but also to be prepared to respond to the crisis of a pandemic            Senator Clinton  s 2006 seasonal flu vaccine guide for New Yorkers is available here       The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to CDC Director Gerberding          October 16  2006      Julie Louise Gerberding  M D   M P H    Director  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Department of Health   Human Services  1600 Clifton Road  N W    Atlanta  Georgia 30329      Dear Dr  Gerberding        As we begin the 2006 2007 flu season  I write to ask for an update on your agency  s efforts to track seasonal influenza vaccine           Since 2000  our nation has experienced multiple shortages and problems with distribution of influenza vaccine   During these shortages  many of New York  s seniors and providers have contacted me to express frustration at their continuing inability to accurately predict at which point they may be able to receive seasonal influenza vaccine   At a time when we routinely use tracking to trace deliveries of other goods in the private market  we still cannot accurately predict when a vaccine order might be delivered to a provider              I understand that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have  over the past two years  been working with manufacturers  distributors  and state public health officials to track county level distribution of seasonal influenza vaccine   However  as your own website notes  many in the public health community support a more detailed tracking system  through which we can obtain provider level data          Last year  I introduced legislation with Senator Pat Roberts  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  which would enable us to establish a tracking system to trace the distribution of vaccine from the factory to the provider and identify counties with high numbers of priority populations   With such a system in place  we could easily determine in times of shortage where vaccine was most needed and facilitate distribution to those areas   All of this could take place in a matter of hours  rather than days or weeks   The tracking system in this legislation builds upon the current private system of distribution  and would link information through a national database in a manner that does not jeopardize free market competition           I believe that the model in our bill could be valuable to help ease the problems of distribution for both seasonal flu vaccine and the antivirals  medical supplies  and other resources that will be in demand in a pandemic situation   It simply makes sense to establish a tracking system for vaccine distribution that can be used in both seasonal and pandemic events  in order to have a system that is already operational  rather than rely on untried mechanisms in an emergency situation where we will already be facing multiple obstacles to delivery of health care          I would like to receive additional information about the status of your efforts to improve and expand vaccine tracking   While I am aware that you have been engaging in various demonstration projects  I believe that it is important to translate such projects into wider scale tracking efforts that are interoperable with other flu related surveillance and tracking initiatives of the CDC   In your discussions with manufacturers  distributors  public health organizations  and other stakeholders  what issues have you identified in establishing and implementing a provider level tracking system  and how are you working to resolve these concerns   Given your experiences over the past two years with tracking pilot projects  I would ask that you provide me with a detailed timeline for the CDC  s continuing efforts to establish a national tracking system  Finally  I would like more information on the ways in which you are working to integrate tracking systems for seasonal influenza vaccine with our preparation for pandemic influenza          I look forward to continuing to work with you to improve our ability to respond to both our annual seasonal flu epidemic and the threat of pandemic influenza   Thank you in advance for your response          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton         ,0

1880,"SEN. SANDERS: ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES IS GONE
  Senator Bernie Sanders months ago called on Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to resign. The senator had voiced concern about privacy abuses by the FBI and the lingering controversy over the firing of federal prosecutors. ""It was past time for him to go. He had not been honest with Congress. His credibility was shot. He has not respected the Constitution,"" Sanders said. 
   Sanders added that the confirmation process could be a healthy refresher course in constitutional values.
   ""I think it's time for the Congress to tell the president that we have a Constitution in this country which protects the basic rights of the American people. He cannot do anything he wants whenever he wants. Let's get an attorney general in this country who can be effective in helping to protect the American people from terrorism while at the same time understands what the Constitution is about and respects basic civil liberties of the American people.""

                  New York  NY    In the face of skyrocketing oil prices  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Senate Democrats  calling on President Bush to take immediate action to ensure that New Yorkers and Americans do not become the victims of price gouging at the pump this summer           In a letter to President Bush  Senator Clinton and her colleagues urged him to take action to support federal anti price gouging legislation and renewed their call for a bipartisan energy summit to solve the dangerous problem of America  s dependence on foreign oil  The letter comes only days after Senator Clinton made a similar call to Department of Energy Secretary Samuel W  Bodman and released a county by county analysis showing the impact of projected summer gas price increases on New York        Click here for the county by county breakdown of the projected impact of summer gas prices across the State         High oil prices are already taking their toll on New Yorkers and Americans  From small businesses to county governments  to schools  manufacturers and consumers    everyone is hurting under the pressure of increased prices at the pump and there is no relief in sight  Experts are already predicting an increase in prices of up to 25 cents over last summer  which could have an untold impact on communities and businesses     Senator Clinton said            It is totally unacceptable that New Yorkers are paying  3 or more at the pump for gas  but even more unacceptable that the Administration and the Republican leadership will not support legislation that would protect consumers against unscrupulous companies taking advantage of this already serious situation     Senator Clinton said    We must take long term steps to end our dependence on foreign oil  but in the short term we also need to ensure that New Yorkers are not fleeced this summer to pad the already high profits of oil companies              The text of the Senators   letter is below          April 18  2006         The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President       We are writing to enlist your support in enacting strong consumer protection measures that will protect American consumers from price gouging at the gas pump this summer  You are undoubtedly aware of projections from the federal Energy Information Administration  EIA  that gas prices will rise 25 cents per gallon across this nation compared to last summer   In light of these projections  we believe a federal anti price gouging law should be enacted before the summer driving season begins in earnest  this Memorial Day          Already  price gouging legislation  S  1735  exists that has been cosponsored by nearly a third of the United States Senate  and endorsed by a number of state Attorneys General  This legislation would give federal and state regulators new authority to prosecute price gouging in the wake of national energy emergencies  as well as put in place measures to ban manipulation and enhance the transparency of our nation  s fuel markets  One of the hallmarks of this legislation is that it would also apply to the wholesale fuel markets  an important distinction  given that it is often the large vertically integrated oil companies that dictate the prices that gasoline retailers can charge  While the oil companies rake in record profits  it is often these retailers that bear the brunt of consumer anger          A strong federal price gouging law is only one element of the equation when it comes to putting our nation on the path toward greater energy independence  A comprehensive and smart approach to this vital issue of national security will help curb the tremendous volatility in energy prices that is impacting consumers  businesses and the American economy as a whole  We have thus far been disappointed by your Administrations   lack of response to our invitation to co host an emergency bipartisan national energy summit   This offer still stands  However  in the absence of leadership or cooperation from your Administration  we will soon be moving ahead with our own set of real solutions  which will spur the kind of innovation and investment America needs to secure its energy future for the 21st Century          Our oil dependency is one of the greatest economic and national security challenges faced by our generation  The status quo  in which the security of the United States and our domestic economy is left to the whims OF foreign regimes and companies that do not have the best interests of our nation at heart   is simply not an option  How quickly and aggressively we rise to meet this challenge will be one of the most important tests on which future generations of Americans will measure our leadership and resolve   As such  we hope you will join with us in acting quickly to protect American consumers from price gouging this summer and to vastly accelerate market penetration of biofuels  alternative fuels  and energy efficiency vehicles and technologies  We stand ready to work with you to develop a serious national strategy to curb America  s dangerous dependence on oil          Sincerely           Senator Maria Cantwell  Senator Harry Reid  Senator Richard Durbin  Senator John Kerry  Senator Joe Lieberman  Senator Russ Feingold  Senator Evan Bayh  Senator Ron Wyden  Senator Debbie Stabenow  Senator Hillary Clinton  Senator Jack Reed  Senator Barbara Mikulski  Senator Dianne Feinstein  Senator Byron Dorgan  Senator Joe Biden

1819,"SEN. SANDERS: IMMIGRATION BILL HURTS WORKERS
  Sen. Bernie Sanders today joined AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka; Ed Sullivan, president of the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, and United Food and Commercial Workers President Joe Hansen in detailing how the immigration bill would hurt workers in the United States and other countries.
  Sanders said: 
  ""There has been, needless to say, a lot of debate about the Senate immigration bill. Unfortunately, almost all of that debate has centered on illegal immigration and has down-played the very consequential provisions in this bill dealing with 'guest workers.' 
  ""Let's be very clear about what's happening economically in America today. While the wealthiest people have never had it so good, the middle class is shrinking, poverty is increasing, and millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages.
  ""Since President has been in office, median income for working-age families has declined each and every year. Ominously, even college graduates are now beginning to see a decline in real earnings. And, the American people understand very clearly what is going on economically. A recent Gallup Poll showed that almost 70 percent of Americans believe that the economy is getting worse. And, another recent poll showed that by nearly a two-to-one margin, Americans believe that life for the middle class has gotten worse over the past decade.
  ""In the midst of this harsh and tragic economic reality, we need legislation which will improve wages and income in America, lower the poverty rate and expand the middle class.
  ""Unfortunately, the guest worker provisions in this bill will only make a bad situation even worse, will drive down wages even further, not only for low-wage workers, but for highly-skilled professionals as well. 
  ""The same corporations that supported disastrous trade agreements such as NAFTA and PNTR with China (which have cost us millions of good-paying jobs), the same anti-worker businesses that have fought against an increase in the minimum wage, and that vigorously oppose the rights of workers to unionize, the same business groups that have proudly proclaimed their belief in outsourcing, and have literally urged companies to move American jobs abroad, are many of the same exact companies ho are strongly supporting this bill and the guest worker programs contained in it.
  ""Why? The answer is simple. What companies that employ both low-wage and high-skill employees want is to defy the economic law of supply and demand. 
  ""Instead of paying American workers higher wages and better benefits if there are labor shortages, their solution is to simply bring low-wage workers in from abroad. And let me tell you, there is a never-ending supply of low wage workers from all over the world who would be delighted to work in America.
  ""In terms of guest worker programs for low-wage workers, corporate America claims it need foreign workers to do the jobs 'that Americans just won't do.' 
  ""Really? If these same companies raised wages and provided decent benefits for their workers instead of lowering wages and benefits, I think they would find more than enough Americans flocking to those jobs. In fact, Wal-Mart, which is part of one of the coalitions supporting this immigration bill, found that thousands of workers applied for a few hundred of their jobs at two of their stores that they recently opened - even though their wages are not particularly good. 
  ""And, in terms of professional jobs, the corporate supporters of this legislation tell us they need more H-1B visas because Americans presumably aren't smart enough to be computer professionals, engineers, university professors, accountants, financial analysts, nurses, psychologists, lawyers, elementary school teachers, etc., etc.
  ""Well, I certainly don't believe that.
  ""Finally, on top of everything else, while high-tech companies like IBM, Motorola and Dell are telling Congress that they need to import more high-skilled workers from overseas, these very same companies are busy laying-off thousands of American workers.
  ""It is absolutely clear that our current immigration policies are a mess and we need to make changes. In my view, however, we must and can do that in a way that does not further undermine the working families of our country who are already under severe economic duress.""

1937,"SEN. SANDERS COMMENTS ON U.S.-PERU TRADE AGREEMENT
  Senator Bernie Sanders made the following statement on a United State-Peru trade agreement the Senate approved today: 
   ""What the overwhelming majority of the American people understand is that our trade policy has been a complete failure, it has been bad for the U.S. economy, and it has caused the loss of millions of decent-paying jobs.
   ""The Peru Free Trade Agreement is a continuation of failed agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China. Instead of enacting yet another job-destroying, unfettered free trade agreement, it is time for us to fix our broken trade policies.
   ""We need to negotiate trade agreements that protect middle-class American workers, not just the CEOs of big corporations.""

          Obama Introduces Bill to Strengthen Emergency Medical Care Systems Wednesday  July 25  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt Legislation would better coordinate public health  safety  and emergency services WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007  which would provide funding for programs that would enhance emergency care systems throughout the country   Recent reports indicate that our nation   s emergency medical care system is not yet equipped to take on new challenges we could face in the coming years   Through multi year grants in regions across the U S   this legislation would better coordinate public health  safety  and emergency services  streamline emergency communications and organize medical data and information to better serve the public     Our nation   s emergency departments are overburdened and ill equipped to respond to the public health crises we must be prepared to face     said Senator Obama      This bill will ensure our emergency rooms  medical personnel and response teams have streamlined communications systems  real time data  and other coordination tools   We will face unprecedented challenges in the years to come  and we need to equip our emergency departments to prepare for the unexpected     In 2006  the Institute of Medicine  IOM  published a series of reports titled the Future of Emergency Care   The reports concluded that in many places throughout the nation  emergency medical services  EMS  are highly fragmented  poorly equipped  and insufficiently prepared for day to day operations  let alone major disasters   Furthermore  emergency departments  EDs  are increasingly overburdened   Between 1993 and 2003  the nationwide number of EDs declined by 425 while the number of emergency visits rose by more than 25 percent   from 90 300 000 to almost 114 000 000   ED overcrowding  which can lead to ambulance diversion  flawed coordination between emergency medical services and EDs  poor communication with public health departments  and lack of disaster preparedness are among the areas that need thoughtful improvement    Notably  the American College of Emergency Physicians  ACEP  agreed with the IOM findings  giving emergency care in the U S  a national grade of C    in its 2006    National Report Card on the State of Emergency Medicine      The Improving Emergency Medical Care and Response Act of 2007 Regionalized accountable emergency care systems show substantial promise in addressing the complexity of an efficient EMS response  which must properly manage the coordination of a number of groups  agencies  and individuals involved   from incident recognition to providing specialized care to public education   This legislation would support 4 multi year grants to support demonstration programs aimed at designing  implementing  and evaluating a regionalized  accountable emergency care system   Within a defined region  these systems would be designed to  Coordinate public health  safety  and emergency services  Facilitate access to the emergency medical system  e g   9 1 1 Public Safety Answering Points   Establish a mechanism for ensuring a patient is directed to the proper medical facility  Track hospital resources in real time  e g   bed capacity ambulance diversion   Coordinate standardized data management  for pre hospital  hospital  and inter facility transport  Grant applicants must assure certain criteria are met for the proposed system such as compatibility with applicable State EMS systems  establishment of a designation system for special medical facilities  and inclusion of a patient tracking system   A report will follow the completion of each demonstration program to identify  the impact of the regional  accountable emergency care system  factors contributing to the effectiveness of the system  strategies to ensure long term financial sustainability  policy and legislative requirement for system maintenance  and identified barriers and proposed solutions to those barriers  Support for Emergency Medicine Research  Emergency medicine is uniquely defined by the urgency and location of treatment rather than specific organ systems or conditions   This has proven a challenge for funding in emergency medical research because of the broad scope of clinical disciplines it covers   In 2003  only 0 05 percent of NIH training grants awarded to medical schools went to EDs  compared to 29 percent for internal medicine   This Act establishes support for emergency medical research through various Federal agencies in order to expand and accelerate our understanding of the basic science of emergency medicine and enhancing patient outcomes through improved medical service delivery  This legislation is supported by the American College of Surgeons  the American College of Emergency Physicians  and Advocates for EMS    Senator

1187,June 15  2006 Senator Clinton Calls Secretary Rice to Urge Sending Measure to Congress that Will Enable Israel s Magen David Adom to Join the International Red Cross                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to urge her and the Bush Administration to submit the Third Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions to the Senate  The Third Additional Protocol was approved by member states in December 2005 and provides a means by which Israel  s Magen David Adom can join the International Red Cross   Members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement will gather next week to approve changes necessary to allow Magen David Adom to join the movement             Inclusion of Israel  s Magen David Adom in the International Red Cross has long been on of my top priorities   I urged Secretary Rice to take prompt action to have the United States approve the changes in international agreements that will allow Magen David Adom to join the International Red Cross   It is time to rectify the injustice of Magen David Adom  s exclusion from the International Red Cross     Senator Clinton said           Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate of Magen David Adom  s inclusion in the International Red Cross since she began her Senate term   Last November  Senator Clinton visited MDA  s headquarters in Jerusalem and was briefed about the important humanitarian work that they perform  both in Israel and the world   She and Senator Elizabeth Dole  R NC  have also written to Secretary Rice  joined by a bipartisan coalition of Senators  requesting her assistance in facilitating the submission of the Third Additional Protocol to the Senate             If the Third Additional Protocol is ratified by the United States prior to the International Conference on June 19   21  we believe it will send a clear message of support for Israel to the other Governments   It will also signal to the world that the United States Government has taken a leadership position in the support of a new symbol that will afford needed protection to humanitarians working in conflict zones who otherwise may be targeted if they use the Red Cross or Red Crescent     the Senators wrote          ,0

5511  Date  August 15  2006  Obama Calls on President to Work with Congress to Implement 9 11 Commission Recommendations and Better Protect the United States   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Tuesday criticized the President and Republican controlled Congress for failing to implement and fund the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission to protect our homeland from future terrorist attacks    Obama said that last week s disclosure of a plot in Great Britain to bring liquid explosives onto airplanes demonstrates that  there are too many glaring gaps in our security efforts here at home     From improving security for our rail and transit systems and our chemical plants  to increasing cargo screening in our airports and ports  the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission have been underfunded  or worse  ignored   Obama wrote   Indeed  the 9 11 Commission gave the Administration dismal marks   5 F s and 12 D s   on the implementation of the Commission s recommendations for homeland security     Obama noted that he and his Senate Democratic colleagues have attempted to increase funding for rail security  aviation security and chemical plant security  but these efforts have been rejected by the majority party in Congress  He also voiced concern that President Bush has submitted budgets that have called for decimating programs for first responders     Now more than ever  we need to come together to address the real security needs of the nation   Obama said   I hope the White House and Congress can work to immediately address the 9 11 Commission recommendations and provide adequate funding to guard against terrorist attacks      For the full text of Obama s letter  please see below     August 15  2006   President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    Like all Americans  I am grateful for the work of the British intelligence service  combined with the swift response by authorities across the globe  to prevent what could have been a major terrorist attack last week   Unfortunately  in the more than two years since the bipartisan 9 11 Commission released its report  the Administration has failed to implement many of its most important recommendations and still seems to suffer from the  failure of imagination  that the 9 11 Commission identified   As a result  there are too many glaring gaps in our security efforts here at home    From improving security for our rail and transit systems and our chemical plants  to increasing cargo screening in our airports and ports  the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission have been underfunded  or worse  ignored   Indeed  the 9 11 Commission gave the Administration dismal marks   5 F s and 12 D s   on the implementation of the Commission s recommendations for homeland security     Over the past year and a half  I have joined my Democratic colleagues in the Senate on numerous occasions to fight for funding to ensure that Americans are protected from the next generation of terrorist attacks   However  our efforts have been consistently thwarted by the party controlling the White House and Congress    In July 2005  just a week after the London subway bombings  Sen  Byrd proposed adding  1 2 billion for transit security grants and  265 million for rail security to the FY 2006 Homeland Security appropriations bill   Sen  Schumer also offered amendments to improve the screening of air cargo and to track the shipment of hazardous materials   All three amendments were rejected by Senate Republicans  In March 2006  during the consideration of the FY 2007 Budget Resolution  Sen  Lieberman offered a comprehensive amendment to increase homeland security spending that included  1 billion for rail and transit security   752 million for aviation security  and  150 million for chemical security   This amendment was rejected by Senate Republicans   Sen  Menendez also offered an amendment to increase funding for port security by  965 million   This  too  was rejected by Senate Republicans  And just last month  during the consideration of the FY 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill  Sen  Schumer and Sen  Biden offered amendments to increase funding for rail and transit security  but these amendments were also rejected by Senate Republicans     In short  Congress  failure to adequately fund homeland security has left our nation vulnerable to attacks     The Administration also has submitted budgets that have called for decimating programs for first responders   This year  the Administration s budget proposed eliminating the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program and cutting funds for Emergency Management Performance Grants  both critical sources of homeland funds for our communities      I am also disappointed that the Administration has not taken a lead in pushing for balanced and robust chemical plant security legislation  as Sen  Lautenberg and I have proposed   Five years after September 11  our nation s unguarded chemical plants remain tempting targets for terrorists     In the days after 9 11  the nation was prepared to join together to shore up our defenses and fight the very real terrorist threat we are facing   Unfortunately  that strong sense of national purpose has been tossed aside in favor of partisanship and political brinkmanship   As a result  we are woefully unprepared today on a number of fronts  including rail  port  chemical plant  and cargo security    Now more than ever  we need to come together to address the real security needs of the nation   I hope the White House and Congress can work to immediately address the 9 11 Commission recommendations and provide adequate funding to guard against terrorist attacks      Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator

1952,"SEN. SANDERS INTRODUCED HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN ON SEPT. 5
  Legislation to block implementation of a Bush administration executive order jeopardizing health insurance coverage for children was introduced Wednesday by Senator Bernie Sanders. The Department of Health and Human Services last month sent letters to state health agencies announcing that it was slapping new restrictions on participation in the Children's Health Insurance Program. In Vermont, more than two-thirds of the 3,000-some children now enrolled in Dr. Dynasaur could lose coverage. 
   The new restrictions have been described as ""so draconian as to be unattainable."" The Sanders Amendment would declare them ""null and void."" Vermont and other states once again would be allowed to insure children from middle-income families unable to find affordable health coverage.
   ""At a time when the United States is the only country in the industrialized world that does not provide health care for all of our children, it is beyond comprehension why the president of the United States wants to take kids off the Children's Health Insurance Program rather than adding more kids to the program,"" Sanders said. ""I'm going to do everything that I can to oppose Mr. Bush's initiative and move us closer to the day when all of our children have health insurance.""
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid. Both the Senate and House have passed legislation to extend and expand the program. Bush has threatened a veto.

90,   Kerry  Obama to FCC Chairman Martin  Delay Consolidation Vote  Investigate Minority and Women Media Ownership   or Place FCC Funding in Jeopardy   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Kerry  Obama to FCC Chairman Martin  Delay Consolidation Vote  Investigate Minority and Women Media Ownership   or Place FCC Funding in Jeopardy Friday  December 14  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   December 14  2007  CONTACTS  Liz Richardson  Kerry  or Michael Ortiz  Obama   WASHINGTON D C    Sen  John Kerry  D Mass    and Barack Obama  D Ill   asked Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin to delay a vote on media ownership until the FCC has followed the will of Congress and established a commission to look into minority and women media ownership  Kerry and Obama made clear that if Martin once again bucked the Congress  they would ask the Appropriations Committee to deny funding for implementation of the rule produced by the forced vote     This is a show down with an FCC Chairman who is letting the FCC do the bidding of big corporate conglomerates without giving smaller media outlets a chance to fight back     said Senator John Kerry     I want to thank Sen  Obama for joining with me to help hold the FCC accountable  and ensuring that it promotes a more diverse  independent media in America          We must ensure that we have an open media market that represents all of the voices in our diverse nation  and allows them to be heard     said Senator Obama      The FCC must meet its obligations to our country   s minority communities and not special interests by ensuring that broadcasters are doing right by the communities they operate in before it considers loosening media ownership regulations   I reiterate my call to the FCC to conduct its rules changes in a transparent and inclusive process  respect minority interests  and delay its upcoming vote until further evaluations are completed      Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules   By moving forward with Tuesday   s vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Senators Kerry and Obama sent a similar letter urging the FCC to act on this issue in July  2006  Earlier this month  the Commerce Committee sent Chairman Martin a message with its unanimous approval of a bill that would require Chairman Martin to address the state of minority and women ownership as well as localism before acting on larger media ownership rules   By moving forward with Tuesday   s vote  Chairman Martin is directly contradicting the will of Congress     Below is the text of the letter  December 14  2007 The Honorable Kevin J  Martin  Chairman  Federal Communications Commission  445 12th Street SW  Washington  DC 20554 Dear Chairman Martin  Your testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee on December 13  2007 restates your intention to move forward aggressively with a proposal that would relax media ownership rules with respect to the Newspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule   We reiterate our call from July of last year and in various forums over the last two months for you to delay this vote for a period of time sufficient for the Commission to examine the status of minority and women media ownership in the United States  and to establish a policy to effectively address the need to promote greater diversity in media markets       With respect to this issue  the intent of the Senate Commerce Committee was made clear with its decision to unanimously report S  2332  the Media Ownership Act of 2007   Section 2 of this bill would require the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to establish and convene an independent panel to make recommendations for specific rules to increase the representation of women and minorities in the ownership of broadcast media   The bill further states that the FCC must act on the panel s recommendations before voting on any changes to its broadcast and newspaper ownership rules  We recognize the widespread animosity aimed at the direction of the Commission regarding Tuesday   s scheduled vote   We understand that for a variety of reasons you are being asked to postpone the vote to permit more time for the Commission to fully understand how a relaxation in the Cross Ownership Rule will impact other important issues such as localism   It is our hope that the sum of these objections will convince you to delay this vote until a time following the Commission   s consideration of other pressing matters   Specifically  we believe that moving forward with this change will have a direct and detrimental impact on the state of media diversity   Should you decide to move forward with this vote against the expressed bipartisan  bicameral intent of Congress  we will approach Appropriations Chairman Byrd with a request that funds be denied for the implementation of this rule    Thank you for your consideration   Should you have any questions regarding this request  please do not hesitate to contact any of us at any time  Sincerely  Sen  John Kerry                                 Sen  Barack Obama  Kerry and Obama co sponsored a bill that would require the FCC to have a 90 day comment period on any proposed media ownership rule changes and to conduct a separate proceeding on localism with another 90 day comment period   The bill also requires the FCC to convene an independent panel to make recommendations regarding specific rules to increase women and minority ownership of broadcast media   The FCC would be required to act on the panel   s recommendations prior to voting on changes to broadcast ownership regulations   The bill was sponsored by

1858,"KEEP AMERICAN JOBS IN AMERICA
  The Senate Banking Committee has agreed to hold a hearing on Sen. Bernie Sanders proposal to stem the flow of American jobs overseas by creating a $100 million loan fund to help workers purchase businesses by establishing Employee Stock Ownership Plans or worker-owned cooperatives. ""Employee ownership is one of the keys to creating a sustainable economy with jobs that pay a living wage,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders told colleagues in a floor statement. ""Every day we read about plants being moved to low-wage countries like China or Mexico, but many of the companies were turning profits. Shutting them down was unnecessary.""  
   As Toyota overtakes General Motors as the world's No. 1 automaker, Sanders said the loan program could help save U.S. automotive jobs. ""If we do not change course, there will not be a major auto industry in this country. We must not allow that to happen. Employee ownership may be one way to keep American auto jobs in America."" 
   Employee ownership also could help preserve jobs in other manufacturing industries, a sector of the U.S. economy that has sustained the loss of 3.2 million decent-paying jobs since 2000, when President Bush took office. 
   Under Sanders' proposal, the Department of Commerce would provide financing, technical assistance and grants to employee ownership groups known as Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Eligible Worker Owned Cooperatives. In order to qualify for assistance under the program, employee groups would be required to submit an independent feasibility study that determined loans to their business could be repaid with interest. 
   Sanders said employee ownership already has increased employment, productivity, sales and wages in the United States. Proctor & Gamble and Anheuser Bush are among some 11,000 Employee Stock Ownership Plans already operating in the U.S. A Rutgers University study, he said, found that broad-based employee ownership boosts productivity by 4 percent, increases shareholder return by 2 percent and increases profits by 14 percent. 
   Loans to American workers are a better investment than the billions of taxpayer dollars funneled through the Export-Import Bank to giant, multi-national companies - such as Boeing, General Electric, Halliburton and IBM - that have moved hundreds of thousands of jobs to China, India and Mexico. 
   ""Employee ownership can and should be one of the central strategies in combating the outsourcing of American jobs,"" Sanders added. """"Simply put, workers who are also owners will not move their own jobs to China."" 
   Sanders' proposal is cosponsored by Senators Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, Jay Rockefeller, Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Blanch Lincoln.

1803,"SEN. SANDERS SUPPORTS CIVIL RIGHTS RESTORATION
  As the Senate resumed debate today on a Defense Department policy bill, Senator Bernie Sanders backed a provision by Senator Patrick Leahy to restore habeas corpus rights to all people under American jurisdiction. 
   ""We can fight international terrorism without undermining the Bill of Rights and our international standing as a defender of human rights,"" Sanders said. ""Of course suspected terrorists should be brought to justice, but it is fundamentally un-American to deny accused prisoners the right to a day in court to contest the reasons they are being detained.""
   A Republican filibuster blocked an up-or-down vote on the measure. The 56-to-43 vote to end debate was four short of the number needed.
   Sanders has long been a leader in opposing President Bush's attacks on American constitutional rights and was one of the few to vote against the USA Patriot Act. He also voted against The Military Commissions Act one year ago when Congress stripped some prisoners of the basic right to go to court to challenge their detention.
   Current law shuts off access to U.S. courts for any non-citizen who is deemed to be an enemy combatant and even those ""awaiting"" such a determination. As many as 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States, people who work and pay taxes here, could fall into that category.
   Sanders is a cosponsor of Leahy legislation that would undo the ban on detainees contesting their treatment and seeking freedom. It would allow prisoners held at Guant?namo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere to contest their incarceration in federal court.
   ""This is the first step toward restoring the constitutional protections that are the bedrock of our democracy that have been gutted by President Bush and his administration,"" Sanders said.

                Legislation Would Address Key National Security Priority by Providing Universal Basic Education by 2015 Click here for audio   Washington  DC   U2 lead singer and co founder of DATA  Debt  Aids  Trade  Africa   Bono  today joined Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Senator Gordon Smith  R OR   and Congressman Spencer Bachus  R AL  to launch the Education for All Act of 2007  which would provide  10 billion over the next five years to help developing countries meet the goal of universal basic education by 2015            Funding from the bill would support activities to train teachers  build schools  develop effective curricula  increase access to school lunch and school health programs  and increase parent and community involvement in schools            The 9 11 Commission recognized the importance of education and cited ensuring educational opportunity as essential to U S  efforts to defeat global terrorism   According to the Commissioners  increasing educational access directly impacts U S  national security because it contributes to global stability and prosperity          At the World Economic Forum in 2000  the U S  joined the international community in setting the goal of achieving universal education by 2015   This goal  in addition to eliminating gender disparity at all levels of education  is also part of the U N  Millennium Development Goals   At this point  however  at least 86 countries are unlikely to reach this target          Today  at least 77 million children of primary school age  a majority of which are girls  are not in school   Worldwide  half of school age children who start primary school drop out   Hundreds of millions more are denied a secondary school education             This legislation is the launching pad of what could be the next American moon shot  universal primary education for the 77 million children around the world who aren t in school because they are too poor  This is a huge  brazen and incredibly smart idea at a time when many are questioning our values in the West  or whether we have any values at all   said Bono  co founder of DATA    Representatives Lowey and Bachus and Senators Clinton and Smith deserve thanks for the vision and leadership they have shown with this legislation  We ll do whatever we can to support their efforts to ensure this bill becomes law and will continue to push governments around the world on this issue            Education is not just a building block  but the cornerstone of free societies   Congresswoman Lowey said    Unstable societies are a breeding ground for terrorists   In countries plagued by violence and strife  diseases like HIV AIDS and Malaria  and poverty  education is an equalizing force   Today more than ever  education is a national security issue   It is the key to turning back the spiraling tide against fanaticism            Every child can learn  Every child can grow up to contribute to his or her family  community  and country   But today  not every child has that chance   said Senator Clinton    We are introducing the Education for All Act because we have the capacity  responsibility  and opportunity to help   All it takes now is the will  and I believe with bipartisan support we can turn this bill into law and we can lead the world in meeting the goal of universal basic education            Access to an education for impoverished youngsters helps them gain success and stability   Senator Smith said    Closing the school house door leaves them on the path to poverty and depravity   Americans want to help those in need  whether they are here at home or abroad   Better coordinating our efforts will improve our effectiveness             America is no longer isolated from countries halfway around the globe   said Congressman Bachus    A painful lesson we all learned in the aftermath of 9 11 is how their instability and poverty can have profound negative economic and social implications for us   Today we are engaged in what is essentially a battle of ideas with our enemies   If we are to win this ideological confrontation  education is both our best defense and our best offense           The Education for All Act is endorsed By  The ONE Campaign  The Basic Education Coalition  The Academy for Educational Development  Save the Children  DATA  The

1966,"SENATE PASSES ECONOMIC STIMULUS, SANDERS CALLS 'SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED'
  The Senate late this afternoon voted 81 to 16 for an economic stimulus package that adds tax rebates for retirees and disabled veterans to a House-passed version of the bill.  
   ""I am glad the stimulus package was substantially improved by adding help for 20 million seniors on Social Security and 250,000 veterans living on disability benefits. Including seniors and veterans will help people truly in need, and it will help the economy overall. It's the right thing to do,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said.
   ""I am disappointed, however, that the Republicans filibustered a better package that also included home heating assistance, an extension of unemployment insurance and a tax credit for those involved with wind and solar energy. Our economy is in trouble and I intend to do all I can to bring these measures back up as soon as possible.""
   Under the bill now headed back to the House of Representatives for final passage, income tax rebates of $600 for individuals and $1,200 for couples will go to most taxpayers. Parents also could receive another $300 per child.

activist Haleh Esfandiari and journalist Parnaz Azima and allow them to return promptly to the United States   Haleh Esfandiari currently serves as the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington  DC   Parnaz Azima is a correspondent for the Persian language broadcaster Radio Farda   Both women have dual Iranian and American citizenship  yet are unable to leave Iran to be reunited with their children and grandchildren             The detention of these women is inexplicable and unjustifiable   the Senators wrote    Detaining Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima on questionable grounds contradicts the very essence of their work  to promote peace  reconciliation and freedom for all   We urge you to intervene with the Government of Iran on behalf of these two Iranian American women in order to end their unjust detention and ensure their imminent release and safe passage home            The following is the text of their letter to the UN Secretary General          His Excellency Ban Ki Moon  Secretary General of the United Nations  First Avenue at 46th Street  New York  New York 10017      Dear Mr  Secretary General       We write to express our deep concern over the imprisonment on May 8th of renowned scholar and women s rights activist Haleh Esfandiari and the detention of journalist Parnaz Azima  Haleh Esfandiari currently serves as the director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington  D C    Parnaz Azima is a correspondent for the Persian language broadcaster Radio Farda   Both women have dual Iranian and American citizenship  yet are unable to leave Iran to be reunited with their children and grandchildren  We request you take urgent action to press the Government of Iran to secure the immediate release of Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima and allow them to promptly return to the United States          Dr  Esfandiari was in Iran in order to visit her 93 year old mother   As she drove to the airport to return to Washington  she was robbed of her belongings  including her United States and Iranian passports   After Dr  Esfandiari applied for replacement Iranian travel documents  the Iranian government subjected her to repeated harassment and multiple interrogations because of her position as head of the Wilson Center s Middle East Program   On February 20th  former U S Representative Lee Hamilton  the President and Director of the Wilson Center  wrote to President Ahmadinejad about Dr  Esfandiari s case and asked him to use his good offices to help send Dr  Esfandiari home  however  Mr  Hamilton has not received a reply   On May 8   Dr  Esfandiari was arrested after being summoned to meet with officials at the Ministry of Intelligence in Tehran and taken to Evin prison   Reports have indicated she needed medical attention at that time and that her passport has been withheld            Ms  Azima has been barred from leaving Iran since she arrived in January 2007 to pay a visit to her elderly and ill mother   Her work as a journalist for the U S  funded Persian language broadcaster Radio Farda contributes to expanding access to information for citizens in the Middle East   According to the State Department  her passport has been confiscated  and her lawyers have reportedly been told that she will be unable to leave the country for several years  In April  the Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that it was investigating the case  but to date  the government has taken no action to return the passport to Ms  Azima   In 2006  she was subject to similar harassment from the Iranian government  which seized her passport and refused to return it to her for several weeks           The detention of these women is inexplicable and unjustifiable   Haleh Esfandiari is an author  journalist  and former Princeton University lecturer on such topics as international women s issues  contemporary Iranian politics  and democratic developments in the Middle East  and she has made significant contributions to the body of research on these issues   She has served as the Deputy Secretary General of the Women s Organization of Iran and has written extensively on the role of women as force for positive change in Iran   Her employer  the Wilson Center  is a respected public institution whose mission is to provide a forum for the exchange of views on global issues and it does not try to influence policies directed at the Iranian Government or any government in the Middle East   Ms  Azima works for Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty s Persian language broadcasting service  which is run jointly with the Voice of America   Her journalistic work does not in any way involve activities that would compromise or threaten the Iranian government  rather  it serves to help provide vital information to individuals living in the Middle East   Detaining Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima on questionable grounds contradicts the very essence of their work   to promote peace  reconciliation and freedom for all           We urge you to intervene with the Government of Iran on behalf of these two Iranian American women in order to end their unjust detention and ensure their imminent release and safe passage home          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton   Kay Bailey

1825,"THE WEEK IN REVIEW
  Congress went home for the holidays after wrapping up a session that saw many successes despite attempts by Senate Republicans to throw up roadblocks. In the past week alone, they blocked votes on ending the war in Iraq and other issues. Before lawmakers left Washington they passed a $555 billion spending bill to fund government operations and passed an energy bill that Senator Bernie Sanders helped craft. He also teamed up with Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Peter Welch to press the National Football League to broadcast the December 29 Patriots Giants game. 
   Home for the Holidays Looking back at this year's session of Congress, Senator Bernie Sanders counted many successes despite unprecedented obstruction tactics by Republicans. ""In the face of a record number of Republican filibusters and strong opposition from the White House, we certainly have not accomplished everything that I wanted, but we have made some real progress in significantly increasing funding for our veterans, in raising the minimum wage, in making college education more affordable and for beginning to transform our energy system.""

   Corporate Media Concentration The Federal Communications Commission voted to let broadcasters in the nation's 20 largest media markets also own a newspaper. ""The FCC has made a bad situation worse. Unless Congress overrules this ruling, fewer and fewer big media conglomerates will control what Americans see and hear and read,"" said Sanders. He was among 26 senators who put the FCC on notice that they will work to revoke the rule. To read more about the senator's view, click here. To read John Nichols insights in The Nation, click here.
   Energy Congress approved legislation that will make American cars more fuel efficient and change the ways we heat and light our homes. The measure included provisions by Sanders to promote energy efficiency and to train workers for green-collar jobs. ""Given the crisis we're facing in global warming, the passage of this energy bill is an important step forward,"" he said. ""Much more has to be done in the future."" To read more, click here.
   EPA Decision President Bush's Environmental Protection Agency this week refused to grant California a waiver under the Clean Air Act, which would have allowed it to set more stringent tailpipe emissions standards. Under the Act, California is expressly granted the right to request to institute more stringent standards. Seventeen states, including Vermont, representing perhaps over one-half of all cars in the U.S., stand ready to implement the California standard, if California's request was approved. EPA Administrator Johnson claimed such a waiver would create a ""patchwork of state rules."" This is the same language used by the industry to distort the fact that this would create a simple two-tiered system, not by any definition ""patchwork."" Vermont and other states should be allowed to opt-in to more aggressive standards to further environmental protection. To read more, click here.
   Hot as Hell A B-24 that World War II aviators named Hot as Hell was flying over the Himalayas and crashed into a mountainside in India. The lost crew included two Vermonters. A mountain climber last year discovered a portion of the plane's wing. He notified relatives, who sought help from the Pentagon and, when that failed, from Sanders. ""How is it,"" the senator asked Defense Secretary Gates, ""that the Department of Defense cannot send a recovery team to an ally's country to recover the remains of American servicemen?""

   Patriots vs. Giants Vermont's congressional delegation asked the NFL to broadcast the Dec. 29 Patriots vs. Giants game. The season finale may be seen in Boston and New York for free, but not in most of Vermont, where fans are caught in the middle of a fight between the football league and cable television industry. ""What we now have are two very powerful and wealthy special interests, the NFL and the cable companies, squabbling over who is going to be making more money out of this game,"" Sanders said.

                  Clinton Asks Nuclear Workers Advisory Board to Approve   Special Cohort    Petition Filed by Bethlehem Steel Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today testified before the Presidential Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health at its meeting in Washington  DC   Senator Clinton urged the Board to recommend approval of a special cohort petition recently filed by a group of former Bethlehem Steel workers   Approval of the petition would enable eligible Bethlehem Steel workers to be added to a   special exposure cohort    and receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program without going through case by case radiation dose estimates             Bethlehem Steel nuclear workers and their families have not received the compensation they deserve     said Senator Clinton    I urge the Advisory Board to act swiftly to bring justice and closure to these Cold War heroes              Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 to compensate workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War  Under EEOICPA  former nuclear workers or their survivors were eligible to file claims with the U S  Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history           Claims are decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history  Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was likely to have caused the worker  s illness  This   dose reconstruction    process has been time consuming and controversial  particularly at facilities like Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna  New York  where workers did not wear individual radiation monitors  and there was minimal monitoring of ambient radiation  For Bethlehem Steel workers  compensation decisions have been made using a radiation exposure model that relies on data from another facility  the Simonds Saw facility in Lockport  New York           Anticipating problems with poor records  EEOICPA also provides a process by which groups of workers can petition to be designated as members of a   special exposure cohort     Being added to a cohort means that employees do not have to go through a   dose reconstruction    process  Instead  if a person has an eligible cancer and worked at a facility when weapons work was performed  their cancer is presumed to have been caused by workplace exposure and the person  s claim is paid  Bethlehem Steel workers recently filed such a petition with NIOSH   NIOSH is currently evaluating the petition for completeness   NIOSH will then refer the petition to the Advisory Board  which will vote on whether to recommend approval of the petition to the Secretary of Health and Human Services  who ultimately decides the fate of the petition          Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate for the Bethlehem Steel nuclear workers   She has been pushing NIOSH and the U S  Department of Health and Human Services to speed up and improve the program   She has introduced legislation to get the Bethlehem Steel workers compensated and she has urged the Administration to approve the special cohort petition for the Bethlehem Steel workers           The following is the transcript of Senator Clinton  s testimony today       Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Behalf of Special Cohort Status for Bethlehem Steel Workers Before the President  s Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health      Thank you very much Dr  Ziemer   And really to the entire board   I really appreciate Dr  Ziemer  Dr  Wade  all of you for the time you  re putting into this really important issue  which to me is a matter of national obligation and I  m grateful to you for taking it so seriously            I  m here today because this body  the President  s Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  has the authority and responsibility to oversee the work the agencies that implement the Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program   One of the board  s specific responsibilities is to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services about whether to approve special exposure cohort petitions that have been referred by NIOSH   While it is not on your agenda this week  you may soon have the responsibility to make such a recommendation on a petition that Bethlehem Steel Workers have submitted to NIOSH            So I come today with a simple message  Bethlehem Steel workers deserve a special exposure cohort and I urge you to recommend one when the petition comes before you            This is one of the most heart rending issues that I  ve worked on in my time in the senate   Like workers at many other sites around New York and our country  Bethlehem Steel employees were essential to our Cold War effort   These people literally built our nuclear arsenal in the decades after World War II and helped us eventually to win the Cold War   In the late   40s and early   50s  the government contracted with Bethlehem Steel  which is in Buffalo  to roll uranium at their plant   But the workers weren  t told what they were working with   They weren  t provided with safety equipment to shield them from radiation   They weren  t monitored to determine how much radiation they were being exposed to   But if you talk to Ed Walker who  s here somewhere  ED  s back there  and to the other workers who I  ve spent time talking to  or to their spouses  or their children of workers who have passed on  you know that this was hot  dirty work  Uranium dust was thick in the air   They breathed it   They coated their hands with it   They would sit on areas in the plant to eat lunch and put their lunch down and the uranium dust would be on their sandwiches   They ingested it   It covered their work clothes            So it  s not surprising that many got them got cancer   And for decades they petitioned their government for help and have been denied   Congress finally did the right think in 2000 with the act that you are part of administering   This was a landmark law and it was such in the tradition of our country to acknowledge the wrong that the government had done  and promise timely compensation to workers and their survivors            We have yet to realize the full promise of that legislation  Since 2001  I have been pushing NIOSH and HHS to speed up and improve the program  Initially I urged NIOSH to make improvements to the Bethlehem Steel site profile and make it better reflect the conditions at Bethlehem Steel            As you know  the original site profile was developed without even a visit to the Bethlehem Steel plant   In the last several years NIOSH has made improvements to the site profile and I thank NIOSH for that   But the more I looked at the situation and the more information that workers and their survivors brought forward to me it became clear that there were great disparities between the site profile and actual conditions at the site   And so I became even more convinced that reconstructing doses for Bethlehem Steel workers is an impossible task   It shouldn  t be surprising   After all  we  re talking about work that occurred in secret 50 years ago and before modern radiation monitoring and safety practices had been developed   As a result  the inability to estimate Bethlehem Steel worker doses is not a failure  it can  t be done   The failure would be if we don  t recognize a special cohort that will give them the recognition  the justice that they deserve            When Congress passed the law in 2000  it recognized that reconstructing doses would be impossible in many cases and that  s why the special cohort process was included in the law   The statute to my reading is pretty clear   It says that if the government doesn  t have the information to reconstruct doses then workers should be given the benefit of the doubt and their claims should be paid   More precisely it provides for classes of workers to be added to a special exposure cohort if it  s not feasible to estimate the radiation doses with sufficient accuracy  and there is reasonable likelihood that the radiation dose may have endangered their health            I don  t think we could have a clearer case than Bethlehem Steel where not a single worker wore a radiation badge   Where the only radiation measurements we have are a handful of air samples   Where the workers rolled uranium and where many of them contracted radiation related cancers            So I  m appealing to you to help us bring this process to a conclusion   It has been six years since Congress passed the law   I have had meetings with these survivors and with the workers themselves  but there are not many workers left   I think they deserve to be compensated and really given justice for what they did for our country            I understand the site profile is under final revisions  and I just don  t see there  s any way that it can be a fair rendition of what the men in that plant were exposed to   I urge NIOSH to move swiftly to qualify Bethlehem Steel  s petition   I urge this board to forward it to Secretary Leavitt with a favorable recommendation  and I appreciate very greatly the advocacy and the effort you  ve undertaken  because when a document surfaced earlier this year that showed OMB was looking for ways to limit the designation of special exposure cohorts as a cost cutting measure  that was a real slap in the face to these nuclear workers  and it was a slap in the face to Congress as well   I think the law is clear and I  m pleased that it looks as though OMB is backing off of that position   But we don  t want to give them a back door to realize cost cutting at the detriment of the workers who deserve this compensation             So I thank you for your consideration of this   It  s hugely important not just for Bethlehem Steel Workers but for workers and survivors at other sites throughout New York and across our country   We think that justice is long overdue   I  m grateful for what you are doing and I hope that we will be able to continue in the spirit that this legislation was passed  to do what is right by the men and women who did so much for us            ,0

                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with a bipartisan coalition of Senators to urge the United Nations to grant general consultative status to the Jewish National Fund of the United States  JNF US    In a letter to the 19 Permanent Representatives who sit on a key United Nations committee  the Senators urged them to vote in favor of granting this status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  ECOSOC            This letter sends a strong message to the key United Nations committee that we support granting the same access to the Jewish National Fund as others around the world enjoy   By granting general consultative status  the Jewish National Fund will bring regional environmental issues to the table to help foster regional peace in the Middle East   said Senator Clinton           The letter outlined the support of the JNF US and the reasons it should be granted general consultative status   By gaining consultative status at the United Nations  the JNF US will be able to share their environmental expertise with the entire international community by proposing agenda items for discussion  offering expert testimony  and circulating written statements             Currently the U N  allows more than 2 800 NGOs consultative status   In January  the JNF US application was deferred for further consideration on the request of representatives of Qatar and Egypt   The UN committee will be meeting next week to once again take up the Jewish National Fund s application           Senator Clinton was joined by Senators Bob

conferences on areas of its expertise  including sustainable development and water and environmental issues   These issues are key components of the U N  Millennium Developmental Goals of 2015   Currently  more than 2 800 non governmental organizations like the JNF US enjoy consultative status with the U N  ECOSOC          The worldwide family of JNF agencies was founded in 1901   The JNF US was founded in 1926 to raise funds in the United States for the purposes of purchasing and developing agriculturally unproductive land in the British Mandate of Palestine   Since Israel achieved its independence in 1948  the JNF US has dedicated its efforts in Israel to support six major areas  ecology and forestation  water  community development within the June 4  1967 boundaries  research and development  tourism and recreation  and education   The JNF US is a registered 501 c  3  organization in the United States and it has received the highest ratings by Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau          The JNF US is a global environmental leader with an extraordinary record of planting 240 million trees and building 180 reservoirs throughout Israel  providing 15 percent of that nation s water needs   The JNF US s founding in 1991 of the International Arid Lands Consortium enabled it to work closely with Israel s neighbors  including Jordan and Egypt  on multilateral research focused on water supply and land reclamation projects   The JNF US recognizes the role that cooperation and research on environmental issues can play in fostering regional peace in the Middle East            We understand that the U N  ECOSOC Committee on Nongovernmental Organizations  of which your nation is a member  will take up the JNF US s application next week   JNF US representatives have already participated in other United Nations conferences   We believe that granting the JNF US general consultative status with the U N  ECOSOC is an appropriate step that recognizes its constructive efforts on behalf of environmental protection and regional integration in the Middle East   Therefore  we strongly encourage your government to vote in favor of the JNF US application for general consultative status with the U N  ECOSOC                                                     Sincerely            ,0
1131,March 14  2007 Dingell  Clinton Announce Initiative to Expand Access to Healthcare Coverage to All Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Children s Health First Act Introduced Today in Both Chambers of Congress            Washington  DC   Today Representative John D  Dingell  D MI   Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce  and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  announced that they have introduced in both chambers of Congress the Children s Health First Act  a major legislative initiative aimed at providing all children with access to quality  affordable healthcare coverage   This bill includes incentives for states to expand children s healthcare and identify and enroll uninsured kids that already quality for coverage under existing public programs but are not enrolled           This legislation has the potential to improve the lives of millions of children   said Congressman Dingell    It s a disgrace that  in a country that spends  1 9 trillion on healthcare  nearly nine million children are without health insurance   With this bill  we can maximize opportunities for children to receive the care they need to stay healthy   It s time for Congress to act to protect the most vulnerable among us   our children             I was proud to help create the State Children s Health Insurance Program during the Clinton Administration and I am proud today to take another important step forward for our children   said Senator Clinton    Making health care accessible and affordable for all children will keep kids healthy  save lives  control costs  and end heartache and worry for so many parents   This plan is practical and fiscally responsible   it will honor our values and prevent kids from needing more costly healthcare in the future            Nearly two thirds of uninsured children are in low income families and more than half are in working families   These children are more likely to be sick and less likely to receive care for health problems   Untreated illnesses and injuries can have lifelong consequences  put children at greater risk for both hospitalization and death  and lead to increased healthcare costs later in life          Reverend Heyward Wiggins  leader in the PICO National Network and pastor in Camden  New Jersey  joined with Dingell and Clinton in calling for expanded healthcare coverage for children   For the faith community that PICO represents covering all children is a simple moral requirement that no politician can ignore   said Wiggins          The Children s Health First Act allows States to expand children s health coverage to families up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty level  which is  70 000 for a family of three  through the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  and receive increased Federal payments          It also provides States with the tools and resources necessary to identify and enroll the six million children who  though eligible for existing coverage programs  are not enrolled            This legislation offers a new affordable coverage option for both families and employers by allowing them the opportunity to buy health insurance coverage through SCHIP   And it provides new incentives to strengthen and protect employer sponsored coverage  something more than 50 percent of children enjoy today           Under the Children s Health First Act  States would be able to provide affordable new coverage options  including the option to offer coverage to older children   States could also offer coverage to legal immigrant children and would have new incentives to offer coverage to pregnant women           To prevent future funding shortfalls like those currently facing a number of states  the Children s Health First Act would provide future SCHIP funding based upon prior year spending indexed each year by medical inflation and a State s child population growth          A full summary of the bill can be found at http   energycommerce house gov          ,0
764,November 10  2005 Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to the American Bar Association  ABA  International Rule of Law Symposium                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Thank you  Karen  I can  t think of a better person to introduce me because after all those much too generous comments it  s only fair to say that Karen herself is a trailblazer for women in the law  And she has given a lot of time over the years very generously to smooth the way for women entering the law here and internationally         I  m pleased that I could be here because as many of you know the Senate is in session  and we had votes and it wasn  t at all apparent until the very end that I could get here and  unfortunately  I  ll have to speak and leave and go back to the Hill  But I want to commend the ABA for convening this International Rule of Law symposium  I want to recognize Michael Greco  the ABA President and other elected heads of the various committees along with the House of Delegates and of course Bill Ide with whom I  ve worked over the years         I also before getting started want publicly to express my condolences and sympathy to the people of Jordan because of the horrible attack which they endured yesterday with loss of life and casualties  Our thoughts and prayers are with them  particularly with those who perished  and their loved ones  It  s a further brutal reminder of the importance of the rule of law and the necessity of our efforts to spread the rule of law and help to embed it in societies as a guarantee not only of freedom  but against violence         Two years ago the Nobel peace prize was awarded to Shirin Ebadi  an Iranian lawyer  judge  and activist for the rights of women  children and the oppressed  In announcing her award the Nobel Committee wrote    No country deserves to be labeled civilized unless the rights of women and children are respected     Malalai Joya would agree  She came of age in Afghanistan  s twenty year spiral of war  warlords  extremism  and repression  She had a different vision for her country    one where the law  not the gun  held sway for women and men alike  And she spoke out bravely against the warlords who still tyrannize too many Afghans and stand in the way of the rule of law and the spread of freedom  Two months ago she was a top vote getter in Parliamentary elections and today she sits with 67 women colleagues in the Afghan National Assembly         I  ve been asked to address briefly the rule of law as it affects the role of women and girls around the world  It obviously is part of a much broader agenda that you are discussing  but I commend you for coming to this conference with the important goal of creating an international rule of law movement  because you and many of us around the world know that without the rule of law we do not have a solid foundation for democratic freedom  for peace and stability  and for economic growth      Women like Shirin and Malalai are living in the 21st century the words that John Locke wrote in the 17th century    The end of law is not to abolish or restrain  but to preserve and enlarge freedom     Around the world today  women are struggling to gain access to those levers  They  re using law to preserve and enlarge the freedoms that they  their families  and their entire societies enjoy  Their successes over the last decade form the strongest argument I can imagine for the law  s power to end conflicts  lift lives  and transform societies  The ABA knows this  and your pioneering work on the rule of law in Central and Eastern Europe  as well as your support for women in the law here at home and around the world  has been an important part of that success         But what do we do now to keep that movement going  How do we provide the education so that women and men together are empowered to understand their rights and to act on them  How do we provide better health care and law enforcement so that women and men have the resources they need to keep their families healthy and safe  How do we fight to end the scourge of human trafficking  a modern day form of human slavery        When we talk about the rule of law  especially when we talk about it in other places and recognize leaders who are fighting on behalf of the rule of law  we cannot forget that we  in the United States  have a special heritage and responsibility to uphold the rule of law  That heritage begins with our priceless Constitution and Bill of Rights  But equally important is our centuries long journey toward applying the protection and dignity of those laws to every human being         From our own civil rights and women  s rights movement  we can see shining examples  People like Rosa Parks  who we honored in death for her life and legacy last week  Of those who used our tradition of the rule of law to right the wrongs of the law  We have inspired millions around the world to attempt to do the same  But with that inspiration comes responsibility not to be perfect  for that is impossible  but to admit our mistakes and use the rule of law to mend them  not cover them up  When we fail that standard  we harm the ideals we most seek to promote and undermine the foundations of our own society and our influence around the world         Showing the world that we hold ourselves to the rule of law  even when it is not easy to do  will do more to promote our common values than a dozen public diplomacy listening tours or rule of law speeches  When we show the world that our system is premised on the rule of law  that we do not fear transparency into the workings of our government  when we aim to hold every part of our government accountable  then we much more than in words  but in deeds promote the rule of law  I certainly hope that as we debate these matters right now in the Congress  that the Congress and the Administration will demonstrate that commitment to the rule of law that has always been the hallmark of America         Because it becomes difficult when we promote the rule of law elsewhere if we do not abide by it at home  It makes it more challenging for us to show the world that we value the rule of law and be a catalyst for changes elsewhere  Today for example  I  m sending the President a letter urging him to raise the issue of the rule of law and human rights when he engages in critical summit meetings next week during his visit to the People  s Republic of China   While there has been progress in China  too often laws are ignored with dire consequences for businesses  individuals  and families         I am particularly concerned that 26 years after China enacted its repressive one child policy  officials apparently continue to punish women and couples for bearing children  These abuses have reportedly included denial of social benefits  fines  detention  destruction of property  forced abortion and forced sterilization    everything that runs against our deepest feelings and values  I support the government of the United States speaking out strongly against these coercive measures and at the same time promoting non coercive family planning programs that respect the rights and choices of women         Strength and respect for the rule of law is a value that knows no national boundaries  And social and economic advances can only be lasting if they are built on a foundation of respect for human rights         The rule of law may begin in law books and congressional or legislative debates and courtrooms  It doesn  t end there  It finds its most vibrant expression in the actions of citizens    ordinary men and women who draw courage from the law to take a stand for their own rights and for those of others         Over the past decade  an extraordinary global movement for women  s rights has breathed new meaning into the rule of law  beginning as Karen pointed out  in a most unlikely place  The 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing  Now many doubted that a United Nations conference on women and one held in Beijing would have any impact  And many of you may recall there was a good deal of grumbling about whether the United States should participate and certainly whether I  as First Lady at the time  should participate         But I believe then  as I believe now  I don  t think we promote our ideals and goals by disengaging from those with whom we disagree  I think it is especially important  in fact  to engage in a very assertive way  to make it clear that we stand for different values and ideals and to help bring a consensus into being around them         I thought that this could be a historic conference that would shine a bright light on the issues that matter most in the lives of women and their families  Access to education  health care  jobs and credit  The opportunity to enjoy the full range of political  legal  and human rights  Some of you were there  It was a gathering that lasted only a few days and it had a counterpart in Huairou that was the national nongovernmental organization meeting  and between the two of them it launched a campaign to change laws and change attitudes across our globe         Here in the United States we also took a hard look at ourselves  The Clinton Administration became the first to both understand and publicly state that investments in women and girls should be an integral part of foreign policy  We started the Presidents Interagency Council on Women  which I was honored to Chair  and we followed up on Beijing to make sure that if we were going around telling other countries what they should do to make sure they promoted the rule of law on behalf of women and girls  that we had done all we needed to do at home         We launched the Vital Voices Democracy initiative to help women build democratic institutions and market economies  to get the training they needed personally to participate in the economic and political life of their societies  And that continues as the Independent Nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership         Now it is widely accepted today that focusing on women as a key to building democracies  growing economies  ending conflicts  and strengthening the rule of law is understood  But just ten years ago that was news to a lot of people         And in just ten years we have seen the results as that news has impacted on the political and economic structures of various countries  Nations from Mongolia to Indonesia to Tajikistan are passing better laws  protecting women from discrimination  abuse  and violence         Worldwide  more women than ever are writing laws and enforcing them at the highest levels of government  The proportion of women legislators worldwide has grown every single year  and more women have become heads of state or government in the ten years since Beijing than in the previous 25 years         I think it  s worth noting that some of the fastest growth has come in post conflict countries  where anyone  man or woman  must be particularly brave to enter politics  Afghanistan has had its first woman presidential candidate  its first woman provincial governor  In this year  s legislative elections  women made up ten percent of the candidates and 44 percent of the voters  Female turnout actually rose since the 2004 president elections  When I was last in Afghanistan earlier this year  I met with many of these women  urban  rural  secular  religious who are just anxious to take their place in rebuilding their country         This is also true in Iraq  where women of every faith and ethnicity are braving the very dangerous security conditions to fight for change  Last week  I met with Iraqi women journalists who shared with me how the lack of personal security in the face of a violent  deadly insurgency affects everything they are trying to do   yet they keep trying  The number of voters who have braved that insurgency has continued to increase  They will have a new election on December 15 that will finally choose a legislature to write the rules that will determine women  s rights  personal security  and so much else        Now under Saddam Hussein  women like all Iraqis were brutally repressed  despite the fact they were given rights on paper in the Iraqi Civil Code  I am very alert to the fact that we must ensure that women have rights more than just on paper in Iraq  It would be a cruel irony if when there is an opportunity finally to have an elected government that writes the laws  the legal protections Iraqi women have are lessened or ignored        So there  s a lot to do  The agenda ahead of us  when it comes to women and girls  is full  in part because despite all these advances  and there are so many more that I could reference  women still comprise the most poor  illiterate  and uneducated         Many women lack the most basic rights and the ability to enforce even the rights they have  In Afghanistan  a beloved national poet was beaten to death by her husband after an argument while her own mother stood by  She was 25         I want to focus my call to action on three areas particularly related to the rule of law  First  ending the scourge of human trafficking  second giving women legal and actual control over their health  and third  educating women and men to know and defend their rights         We must prevent and punish violence against women  One of the great advances we made after Beijing was to underscore the point that domestic violence was not cultural  it was criminal  And there needed to be laws in every society against domestic violence         We now face a new and growing form of violence against women  Organized trafficking that enslaves and degrades hundreds of thousands a year  We  ve made progress in raising awareness about this new slavery  but not enough to break the criminal organizations that profit from it         In recent years  first under the Clinton Administration and then under the Bush Administration  we had passed laws against trafficking  We had made it a primary issue in international and bilateral negotiations  and I  m delighted that just this last week we deposited our ratification of the protocol to prevent  suppress  and punish trafficking in persons  especially women and children         But we  ve got to do more to back up our rhetoric with actions  We need to fund the organizations that provide care and legal assistance to the victims of all forms of trafficking  We have to make sure that it is not viewed as a marginal crime to be ignored by law enforcement in countries where it is taking place         We face a particularly horrific problem with re trafficking  I  ve been to countries where there is a very high rate of trafficking of young girls into sexual slavery  brothels  legalized prostitution  And I  ve seen in parts of Southeast Asia  particularly places where you can tell just by driving by which families have sold their daughters and which have resisted  Families who have sold their daughters often have a satellite with television reception or a new vehicle  maybe the first in their family  And I  ve met the girls who  ve been trafficked  sold by their fathers  sometimes escaping  making it back home only to be shunned  facing stigma  and sometimes sold again        We need to do more to both raise the visibility of this issue  recognize that it happens even in the United States  and do more to provide the resources to combat it  and make it a primary objective of any rule of law initiative       We also have to do more to get medical care and health information  particularly family planning information and prevention of HIV AIDS to women and girls  We still face an unacceptably high level of maternal and child mortality in many places in the world         The HIV AIDS pandemic is one of the leading threats to women  In Africa  young women often have absolutely no authority to resist early marriage or sexual advances  In fact  they are three times as likely to contract the virus as young men  They try to protect themselves  but often do so without the full support of the law         In too many places inheritance laws  for example  leave a widow nothing with which to support her children  often sending mothers or daughters into prostitution and continuing the cycle of HIV  Property and divorce laws often leave a woman little control over her situation within marriage and little ability to escape  The rule of law needs to recognize the rights of these women and girls  And although we  ve made some progress in some African countries  we have a long way to go        We also need to ensure that women enjoy the fundamental right to plan their own families and have access to family planning services  Unfortunately in recent years  our government has not been making the commitment to this that I wish it would  We should be attempting to educate people about reproductive health and how to prevent unsafe and unwanted pregnancies         It does not help that we had the Global Gag rule reinstated  which means that no US support can go to local health providers who offer not only abortion or abortion counseling in circumstances that we often would believe is appropriate  but because these organizations often provide a range of services  the failure to fund them means that the full range is shut down  We know that one of the most effective ways to reduce the number of abortions is to empower women to make decisions about their own health         We also need to ensure that the doors of education are open to every girl and boy in every country on every continent  Rule of law societies demand citizens prepare to know and defend their rights  Educating girls is one of the most important ways we can advance the rule of law  Not only are we likely to produce healthier families and lower rates of mortality  malnutrition and disease  educating children  particularly girls  correlates to economic growth  and it is one of our best weapons against the spread of terrorism        I introduced the Education For All Act in Congress last year because serving on the Armed Services Committee  I have had the opportunity to ask a number of officials in the Administration what else we could be doing to combat terrorism  And I recall very well the response that I received from Former Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz  who said the most important thing we could do would be to educate girls and women         So I took that as perhaps a good sign we might actually do something about it and introduced legislation that calls for a clear global strategy to achieve universal global education by 2015  I think making the education of girls a top priority is one of the most important ways we can combat terrorism and advance the rule of law      There is much work to be done  and I think that this conference and the initiative that the ABA has undertaken comes at a particularly timely moment  Not only because of what we see happening around the world as democratic governments such as our own and those in Europe grapple with civil unrest  grapple with the challenge of suicide bombers  and try to figure out how we can maintain open  free societies and provide security and stability to our people         But we know the way forward  Keeping in mind the rule of law gives us the best example that we could have and debating these issues in sessions like the one you  re holding here  using the combined intelligence and experience of people from our own country as well as around the world  is important and more likely to lead us to the appropriate conclusions        Nelson Mandela said in 1989 when he saw a brave young man confronting a Chinese tank in Tiananmen Square  he thought of Rosa Parks  He called it a   Rosa Parks moment     We  ve been thinking a lot about Rosa Parks  and I think that one of the reasons for the great outpouring of support for her  the unprecedented decision to allow her to lie in state  the first woman  the first African American to do so  is serving a great tribute to her life and legacy  but it also demonstrates that at this moment in our own history  we are looking for examples  We are searching for ways that peacefully  we could use the law to make changes here at home and around the world that will benefit ourselves and our children        The Rule of law is a powerful force  It has the potential not only to harness  but unleash human potential beyond our understanding  rooted in the drive for justice  Rosa Parks understood that  She did not come to that day on the bus as a tired seamstress who just decided not to move  She tried to vote three times and had to take literacy tests and was turned down until finally  local officials gave in and allowed her to register         She joined the NAACP and learned about what it would take to be part of nonviolent  civil disobedience  She attended the Highland School  where with other likeminded advocates  she was instructed in ways to take a stand and to make it clear that in this country that believes in the rule of law  we had a lot of work left undone  So on that day on the bus  it may have been a decision that she made in the spur of the moment  but it was a lifetime in making  And it could only have been made within the context of a conviction that the rule of law would finally triumph         That  s what sends people like Shirin Ebadi into Iran  s courtrooms and Malalai Joya onto Afghanistan  s campaign trail  That is what  s driving women and men all over the world to change their societies for the better  And at this point  in American history and international history  it is more important than ever that they be joined by lawyers and judges across the world who are committed to furthering the rule of law and making it possible for every boy and girl to believe that they have the right to grow up and live up to their own God given potential  Thank you all very much              ,0

1857,"SENS. LEAHY, SANDERS, REP. WELCH ASK PRESIDENT FOR DISASTER DECLARATION TO MAKE VERMONT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF
  The Vermont Congressional Delegation (Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Rep. Peter Welch) Wednesday night asked President Bush for a disaster declaration to make Vermont eligible for federal disaster relief after last week's Nor'easter. The Delegation timed the letter to buttress Gov. Jim Douglas' request to the President for a disaster declaration. The text of the Delegation's letter to President Bush follows, below (a pdf attachment of the actual letter will momentarily be sent separately):  
   April 25, 2007 
   The Honorable George W. Bush The President of the United States 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., NW Washington, DC 20500 
   Dear Mr. President: 
   We write to ask that you declare an emergency for the state of Vermont, which will make the state eligible for federal funds necessary to recover from a recent severe storm. Federal funding is particularly needed for cleanup and recovery to public property, as well as hazard mitigation. 
   Last week, a Nor'easter moved through the state, bringing fierce winds and heavy precipitation. Trees, hundreds of years old, fell on power-lines, homes, and businesses. There has been major flooding in the southern portion of the state, and large sections of southern Vermont counties remained without power for days. Well over 15,000 power outages were reported. 
   After the emergency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) established a field office in Rutland. Representatives from the agency visited several of the affected areas, and the damage assessment determined that well over $2 million in damage occurred across the state. Among the seven counties in the State that likely qualify for public assistance -- including Windham, Windsor, Bennington, Rutland, Caledonia, Essex, and Orange Counties -- Windham County alone had damage well over $1 million. As the specific needs of communities become clearer the cleanup funding promises only to increase. 
   It is one of the greatest responsibilities of the federal government to ensure that our state and local governments can cleanup after a natural disaster. 
   Sincerely, 
   PATRICK LEAHY, United States Senator 
  BERNARD SANDERS, United States Senator 
  PETER WELCH, United States Representative

1442,October 17  2007 Senator Clinton Applauds Announcement of Yucca Mountain Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Senate EPW Chairman Boxer Announces October 31st Oversight Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement on the announcement that the United States Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  will hold an oversight hearing on the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository project on October 31  2007     I applaud Chairman Boxer for scheduling this important hearing  a step that I called for earlier this year   I am strongly opposed to Yucca Mountain because there are too many unanswered questions about both the geology of the site and integrity of the science done to support the decision to store waste there   Despite these questions  the Administration is rushing to license the project  and has even announced plans to double its size  That s why this hearing is so important   We need answers about these issues  and I will be asking for them on the 31st         ,0
1157,December 15  2005 Senator Clinton On National Assessment Of Adult Literacy  Call To Action To Improve Our Nation s Education System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Today  the National Center on Education Statistics of the Department of Education released a national assessment  the first since 1992  of our nation s literacy levels    The Center also released a New York state specific report   Both reports show that our nation s education system is failing many Americans  particularly people of color         This report is a real wake up call for policymakers and educators   said Senator Clinton   Unfortunately  it confirms what I ve heard from employers for years    far too many New Yorkers lack the skills to compete in today s economy   The No Child Left Behind Act shined a bright light on the achievement gap and we have made some progress  But this stunning report illustrates that we still have a long way to go   No Child Left Behind was supposed to be a combination of real reform and the resources needed to make that reform real  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has failed to deliver the resources it promised  In 2005  New York received  729 1 million less than what the state was promised under No Child Left Behind   Nationally  the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress have provided nearly  7 billion less than what was promised when the law passed   We need high standards and high quality teachers   To deliver both  we need the President and the Republican leadership in Congress to keep their promises   said Senator Clinton         The report found that only 11 percent of New Yorkers and 13 percent of Americans nationwide are proficient in basic reading skills   The average literacy of blacks and Asian Pacific Islanders is significantly lower in New York than across the nation   Thirty percent of blacks in New York read at a below basic level  according to the assessment  and only one percent are proficient  Whites fared somewhat better  Sixteen percent of whites in New York are proficient in reading and only nine percent read at a below basic level        Senator Clinton has consistently fought for more resources for New York schools   On October 26  2005  Senator Clinton offered an amendment to meet the federal government s promise to fully fund special education by providing  243 million for New York Schools  She also co sponsored an amendment to provide the promised funded level for No Child Left Behind in the FY06 education spending bill             ,0

1622,September 19  2005 Senator Clinton Underscores Need to Keep Open Manhattan and Brooklyn VA Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New York  NY    Echoing her long standing opposition to closing either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA hospitals  Senator Clinton today stressed the need to keep open both facilities in testimony to the Local Advisory Panel of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  project   Senator Clinton in her testimony emphasized that each hospital plays a unique role in their respective communities and the closure of either facility would change dramatically the way medical care is delivered to veterans in the New York City metropolitan area             At this time in our nation  s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation     Senator Clinton underscored in her testimony     Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care             Senator Clinton made clear that any proposed plan to consolidate delivery of VA healthcare services must take into account the unique relationship between the New York University School of Medicine and the Manhattan VA hospital  The partnership between the institutions has made the Manhattan VA hospital a model of high quality care  with six tertiary care specialties designated by the VA as centers of excellence  Closure of the Manhattan VA would imperil this relationship at the expense of New York s veterans           Likewise  Senator Clinton noted the Brooklyn VA has multiple bed services and provides specialized cancer care   Describing the affiliation it maintains with the SUNY Downstate Medical School  Senator Clinton emphasized that  just as the relationship between the Manhattan VA and the New York University School of Medicine would be imperiled by closure of the Manhattan VA  closure of the Brooklyn VA would threaten the existing SUNY relationship with the VA to the detriment of New York  s veterans          Senator Clinton also reinforced that the CARES process must take into account the practical matter of transportation in its deliberations  The high quality services at the Manhattan VA hospital attract veterans from the City of New York as well as surrounding areas and other states  One of the main reasons that the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located in the heart of Manhattan at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere in the world  Similarly  Senator Clinton noted that a number of SUNY Downstate department chairs have pointed out that the Brooklyn VA is accessible to motor vehicles by virtue of its proximity in Brooklyn to the Belt Parkway and the Verrazano Bridge          In addition  Senator Clinton underscored the critical importance of ensuring that VA s planning process for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals is fully transparent  New York s veterans must be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process           Senator Clinton has fought for New York s veterans throughout the CARES process  Senator Clinton met with VA Secretary Nicholson in April to reiterate her serious concerns regarding the VA CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study yet more changes in New York s VA facilities  Secretary Nicholson agreed to consider the points she raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VAs           Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York s veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care and to keep New York VA hospitals open                     Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Before the Local Advisory Panel of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project        As Prepared for Delivery         September 19  2005      Good afternoon  distinguished members of the Panel  Let me thank you for allowing me to present testimony on the impact that consolidating the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA campuses would have on the veterans of New York and the people who serve their needs at these institutions   As I will explain more fully below  I strongly oppose closing either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA hospitals   Closure would have disastrous consequences for many New York veterans   Closure of either facility would diminish health care quality for veterans who rely on these facilities          At this time in our nation  s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation  Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care          As a starting point  our bottom line goal should be the delivery of high quality health care services to our veterans  delivered as efficiently as possible  Veterans   health care is too important an issue to require an adherence to artificial deadlines and hasty recommendations   With literally the lives of veterans at stake  the panel should not engage in a rush to judgment over closing VA facilities and should not elevate financial considerations over the needs of our veterans          On April 19th  I met with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson and handed him a letter in which I reiterated my serious concerns regarding the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study further changes in New York  s VA facilities   He agreed to consider each of the points I raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s          I must underline at the outset how absolutely essential it is that the VA s planning process for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process  It is the veterans who must remain at the center of this process          As PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  and your Panel proceed with their work  please keep in mind that legislation was included as part of the Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004 requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify Congress before implementing a major mission change at the Manhattan VA and other facilities  The notice to Congress must include an assessment of the effect of the mission change on the population of veterans served by the facility  a description of the availability and quality of health care  including long term care  mental health care  and substance abuse programs  available in the area served by the facility  an assessment of the effect of the mission change on the economy of the community in which the facility is located  and an analysis of any alternatives to the mission change proposed by the community in which the facility is located  by specified other groups  or by the Department of Veterans Affairs          There have been several stages to the CARES process  which in my view has been a rushed process that did not adequately heed the voices of New York  s veterans   The CARES Draft National Plan originally recommended developing   a plan to consider the feasibility of consolidating inpatient care at Brooklyn      The VA  s CARES Commission found that a feasibility study should precede any proposal to consolidate the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses          Former VA Secretary Anthony Principi  s CARES Decision Document  Decision Document  issued in May 2004  directed VA to   undertake a thorough feasibility study of the potential to consolidate the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses                   The Decision Document also states that   the facilities are in close proximity to one another and both have significant vacant and underused space  Through consolidation  VA has the potential to improve use of sophisticated major medical equipment  reduce costly vacant and underused space  and enhance services through development of a comprehensive tertiary medical center that can act as a hub and provide the full continuum of care for Manhattan and Brooklyn area veterans             On May 3  2005 this Local Advisory Panel held a public meeting in Brooklyn   I presented my strong stand against closure of either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA  s          PwC has now presented 9 options related to the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals  including  the   Baseline    option    without any changes to facilities or programs     consolidation at Brooklyn  consolidation at Manhattan  incremental changes at both facilities  and even the closure of both facilities in favor of a facility elsewhere          The closure of either the Manhattan VA or the Brooklyn VA would be ill conceived   Each plays a unique role in their respective communities   The closure of either would result in a dramatic change in the way that medical care is dispensed to veterans in the New York City metropolitan area and beyond   Such a break with current practice would eliminate the possibility of more gradual changes that would consolidate specialty care to meet a changing veterans   population  while refining the specialties of each hospital          Any feasibility study must recognize that the closure of the Manhattan VA will seriously impact the relationship between the New York University School of Medicine  NYUSM  and the Manhattan VA   The Manhattan VA contains six tertiary care specialties that the VA has designated as centers of excellence   These specialties are in Cardiac Surgery  Neurosurgery  Cardiac Vascular Surgery  Comprehensive Rehabilitation Services  HIV AIDS Care  and Dialysis   According to NYUSM  these are the only VA Centers of Excellence in these specialties within 100 miles of the Manhattan VA   The Manhattan facility also houses a designated clinical care unit and research center for AIDS and HIV infection   The Manhattan VA is the VISN 3 referral center for Cardiac Surgery  Neurosurgery  and Interventional Cardiology          The NYUSM  together with its affiliates  the Manhattan VA  Bellevue Hospital  Tisch Hospital  and the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine  supports an Amputee Center and Rehabilitation Medicine Service   The VISN Footwear Center is also found at the Manhattan VA   The Prosthetic and Orthotic Laboratory has a unique role in the area in producing artificial limbs          There is also a substantial Research and Development Service   NYUSM estimates that NYUSM and the Manhattan VA are engaged in approximately  10 million in joint research  with a substantial amount of the funding provided by the National Institutes of Health   However  according to the NYUSM  these endeavors are in jeopardy if the Manhattan campus is closed          The special relationship between the NYUSM and the Manhattan VA has many unique features   That should come as no surprise given the fact that the relationship between NYUSM and the Manhattan VA stretches back almost fifty years   That relationship between NYUSM and the Manhattan VA has made possible much of the excellent health care available at the Manhattan VA          The NYU Manhattan VA relationship  and the high quality of care for veterans it produces  would be imperiled by the closure of the Manhattan VA   Closure of the Manhattan VA could damage the relationship between NYUSM and the New York Harbor Health Care System and cause a reduction in the quality of veterans   health care in the New York metropolitan area   The NYUSM residency program is fully integrated with the Manhattan VA  NYUSM reports that there are typically 125 NYUSM residents at the Manhattan VA            In addition  the New York University College of Dentistry  NYU College of Dentistry    provided over 13 000 visits last year at the Manhattan VA    and thousands at the Brooklyn VA as well          Closure of the Manhattan VA could result in a weakening or termination of the affiliation of the NYUSM residency program with the VA  It is possible that NYUSM will need to establish a partnership with a new entity or reduce the residency program in order to absorb it into their existing facilities          The closure of the Manhattan VA would also likely result in the departure of physicians affiliated with NYU Medical Center from the VA  s New York Harbor Health Care System   As noted previously  the Manhattan VA is the VISN 3 referral center for Cardiac Surgery  Neurosurgery  and Interventional Cardiology   According to NYUSM  the cardiac surgery program at the Manhattan VA   was evaluated by the VA as having the best outcomes in their national system     It is an open question at best whether NYUSM physicians would choose whether to follow the specialty services elsewhere or leave the VA healthcare system altogether          Further  the Manhattan VA can serve to provide vital surge capacity in the event of an emergency in Manhattan   For example  NYUSM is organizing a Consortium on Preparedness in order to prepare an integrated response to a crisis like the tragedy that struck this city on 9 11    The Manhattan VA forms a part of the consortium  s plans  and if the Manhattan VA were closed the consortium would lose resources critical to its plans for assisting with the response to a future public health emergency          The practical matter of transportation is essential to your deliberations   The high quality of services at the Manhattan VA attract veterans from the City of New York  as well as surrounding areas and other states  According to figures for Fiscal Year 2004 provided to my office by NYUSM  nearly 800 veterans from the Bronx and Queens received inpatient treatment at the Manhattan VA  on top of more than 1 000 veterans from Manhattan   So did more than 300 veterans from the Hudson Valley  Westchester and Long Island   One of the main reasons the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located  as it is  in the heart of Manhattan  at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere else in the nation           In short  the potential loss of the benefits of the NYU    Manhattan VA relationship as well as the Manhattan VA  s central location make the proposals that would close the Manhattan VA ill advised            Proposals to close the Brooklyn VA are just as ill advised   A number of SUNY Downstate department chairs have pointed out that it is accessible to motor vehicles by virtue of its proximity in Brooklyn to a significant artery    the Belt Parkway    as well as a major bridge    the Verrazano Bridge    and because the facility maintains plenty of parking   They also note the support the Brooklyn VA provides to the Department of Defense at Ft  Hamilton          The Brooklyn VA has multiple bed services    in surgery  psychiatry  residential substance abuse  and acute medicine  and provides specialized cancer care  According to NYHHS  a Fisher House for oncology patients and their families is expected to be placed at the medical center   The Brooklyn VA maintains affiliations with the SUNY Downstate Medical School and the SUNY Health Science Center in Brooklyn  According to a number of SUNY Downstate department chairs  the medical school is integrated with most of the clinical programs  Just as the relationship between the Manhattan VA and NYUSM would be imperiled by closure of the Manhattan VA  closure of the Brooklyn VA would threaten the existing SUNY relationship with the VA   Closure of the Brooklyn VA could also endanger the continuation of important research    with funding estimated at more than  1 million per year          Moreover  I understand that  according to NYUSM and SUNY Downstate  the Manhattan VA and the Brooklyn VA have already been through a successful consolidation process generating substantial savings while maintaining high quality of care for New York  s veterans   They maintain that this shows the past success of evolutionary change and the vital role that local stakeholders must play in such a process            I understand that NYU Medical School Dean Robert Glickman  MD  and the SUNY Downstate College of Medicine Dean Eugene Feigelson  MD  have jointly written to VA Secretary Nicholson to suggest that three options proposed by PwC    options 1  6 and 7    merit further consideration  However  they emphatically make the point that consolidating the Manhattan VA and the Brooklyn VA into one campus would   be a disservice to our veterans  severely compromising both the quality of care and the access to care           Indeed  the bottom line remains the same as it has throughout the CARES process    the closure of either the Manhattan VA or the Brooklyn VA would hurt veterans          In addition to individual considerations applicable to each VA facility  I am also concerned that the accuracy of VA  s projections for future demand for services are open to question   According to PwC  s Stage I Summary Report    veteran utilization for healthcare services was projected for 20 years  using 2003 data supplied by the VA as the base year and projecting through 2023      However  faulty VA health care demand projections regarding the number of servicemembers returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  was reportedly one of the reasons the VA recently had to make enormous revisions in its health care budget projections  at least with respect to fiscal year 2005          I also question whether the kinds of severe injuries we are seeing in some of the heroic returning veterans of OIF and OEF are being accurately accounted for in VA  s modeling of projected demand   According to the deans of NYUSM and SUNY Downstate  their records indicate that already more than 2 000 veterans from OEF and OIF are currently registered with the New York Harbor Health Care System   They note appropriately that   it is quite possible that the healthcare needs for veterans in modern wars will be higher because a much higher percentage survives severe wounds    and live longer               If VA is unable to accurately predict this year  s and next year  s budgets  in the context of OEF and OIF  projections twenty years in the future should be subject to even greater scrutiny   To move aggressively to close major facilities such as the Manhattan VA or the Brooklyn VA on the basis of such projections is truly ill advised          In meeting with veterans and hearing the comments that veterans and other stakeholders have provided to my office  I have learned a tremendous amount about the value of these facilities and the quality of health care that is delivered there   Our nation  s veterans have served their country with distinction   Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces    a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system   I urge the Panel to take into account the proper factors and input from veterans  I am convinced that if you listen to the voices of New York  s veterans  you will reject proposals for closure and will advise the VA to maintain both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s          Thank you                 ,0

examine whether minority homeowners are being targeted with high priced loans WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras  calling on her to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination   According to recent studies  and an editorial in the New York Times  there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high cost subprime loans than other borrowers   Hundreds of thousands of African American families     many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans     could potentially lose their homes in the coming years   In the letter  Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products  whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices  and whether the lack of lower cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers  The text of the letter is below  October 18  2007    The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20580   Dear Commissioner Majoras  I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday s New York Times which begins   Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom  black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high cost subprime loans than other borrowers  even after controlling for factors such as income  loan size and property location     Subprime in Black and White   The New York Times  October 17  2007   In reality  such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods   More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns     Last year  for example  the Center for Responsible Lending found that for most types of subprime home loans  minority borrowers are more likely to pay higher rates than white borrowers even after accounting for differences in credit scores  loan to value ratios  and other underwriting criteria   And just this week another analysis confirmed that even high income black borrowers are more likely than comparable white borrowers to have risky and costly subprime loans   Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families  Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue   I call upon the FTC to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine if minority borrowers have been the victims of discrimination   Among other things  the Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive marketing acts or practices   Many subprime loans include sales practices or loan features that are potentially unfair and deceptive for borrowers   Some practices  such as yield spread premiums  which encourage mortgage brokers to steer borrowers into the most costly products  or prepayment penalties  which enable lenders to offer mortgages that are unsupported by sound underwriting principles  appear to be the source of significant problems faced by many subprime borrowers   With an estimated 53  of African American borrowers in 2005 receiving subprime loans  and more than 60  of subprime loans containing prepayment penalties  the risks particularly for African American homeowners are substantial   Indeed  hundreds of thousands of African American families     many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans     are expected to face loss of their homes in the coming years   I request that you begin a thorough investigation within five days and provide a status report to my office within 15 days on the following questions  1   Whether there is evidence of lenders or brokers specifically targeting poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products than would otherwise be justified based on legitimate underwriting criteria   2   Whether the marketing of lending products to poor or minority borrowers has been deceptive or unfair   Specifically  whether the disclosure of yield spread premiums and prepayment penalties has been sufficiently transparent to borrowers and whether such or similar sales and pricing practices have been disproportionately detrimental to minority borrowers     3   Whether the lack of lower cost borrowing options  including those regulated by the Federal government  in predominantly minority communities even for higher income borrowers  has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers in their efforts to realize the dream of affordable home ownership and wealth building     Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator

         Growing Momentum Behind Obama  Thompson  Murphy Redeployment Plan Thursday  March  8  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Members of Congress  Including Republicans  Support Iraq War De escalation Act WASHGINTON  DC     The Iraq De escalation plan introduced by Senator Barack Obama  D IL  and U S  Representatives Mike Thompson  D CA  and Patrick Murphy  D PA  has gained the support of 62 Members of Congress  including 3 Republicans    This momentum comes as public support continues to grow for an Iraq plan that will hold Iraqis accountable to benchmarks  prevent our troops from refereeing a civil war  and remove combat brigades from Iraq by early 2008       Because of the President   s failed strategy  and despite the valiant efforts of our troops  our military options in Iraq have been exhausted     said Senator Barack Obama      The American people and the new Congressional majority  along with some wise Republicans  agree that we should begin to redeploy our troops from Iraq so that a political solution can be found       Setting a timeline for redeployment is the right thing to do for our troops and our country   said Representative Thompson   This bill provides an achievable strategy for getting our combat troops out as safely and quickly as possible  while also helping the Iraqi government secure and rebuild its country  It s time to focus our resources on getting the Iraqi government and its neighbors to step up and take responsibility for Iraq s future     Our troops have done what s been asked of them  now it s time for the Iraqis to step up and fight for their country   A timeline will show the Iraqis that we will not be there indefinitely and that they need to come off the sidelines   said Representative Murphy    As someone who served in Baghdad with the 82nd Airborne Division  I can tell you that we need a political solution   not to send more American fighting men and women to referee an Iraqi civil war   This is about doing what s right for our country  and this is a tough  yet sensible plan to do just that    The De Escalation Act would    Stops the Escalation  Caps the number of U S  troops in Iraq at the number in Iraq on January 10  2007  This does not affect the funding for our troops in Iraq  This cap has the force of law and could not be lifted without explicit Congressional authorization  De escalates the War with Phased Redeployment  Commences a phased redeployment of U S  troops out of Iraq not later than May 1  2007  with the goal that all combat brigades redeploy from Iraq by March 31  2008  a date consistent with the expectation of the Iraq Study Group  This redeployment will be both substantial and gradual  and will be planned and implemented by military commanders  Makes clear that Congress believes troops should be redeployed to the United States  to Afghanistan  and to other points in the region  A residual U S  presence may remain in Iraq for force protection  training of Iraqi security forces  and pursuit of international terrorists  Enforces Tough Benchmarks for Progress  These 13 benchmarks are based on President Bush s own statements and Administration documents and include   Security  Significant progress toward fulfilling security commitments  including eliminating restrictions on U S  forces  reducing sectarian violence  reducing the size and influence of the militias  and strengthening the Iraqi Army and Police  Political Accommodation  Significant progress toward reaching a political solution  including equitable sharing of oil revenues  revision of de Baathification  provincial elections  even handed provision of government services  and a fair process for a constitutional amendment to achieve national reconciliation  Economic Progress  Requires Iraq to fulfill its commitment to spend not less than  10 billion for reconstruction  job creation  and economic development without regard for the ethnic or sectarian make up of Iraqi regions  Should these benchmarks be met  the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment  subject to the agreement of Congress   Congressional oversight  Requires the President to submit reports to Congress every 90 days describing and assessing the Iraqi government s progress in meeting benchmarks and the redeployment goals    Intensified Training  Intensifies training of Iraqi security forces to enable the country to take over security responsibility of the country    Conditions on Economic Assistance  Conditions future economic assistance to the Government of Iraq on significant progress toward achievement of benchmarks  Allows exceptions for humanitarian  security  and job creation assistance    Regional Diplomacy  Launches a comprehensive regional and international diplomatic initiative   that includes key nations in the region   to help achieve a political settlement among the Iraqi people  end the civil war in Iraq  and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and regional conflict  Recommends the President should appoint a Special Envoy for Iraq to carry out this diplomacy within 60 days  Mandates that the President submit a plan to prevent the war in Iraq from becoming a wider regional conflict                                      ,1

673,   Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005 Wednesday  January 25  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  January 25  2006  Veterans Administration Denied Health Care Services to Nearly 9 000 Illinois Veterans in 2005   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  denied health care to 8 944 Illinois veterans last year as part of a Bush Administration cost cutting policy begun in 2003  Nationally  more than 260 000 veterans were denied access to VA hospitals  clinics and medications in Fiscal Year 2005    The VA denied nearly 9 000 veterans in Illinois health care services they earned last year  This is an offensive and misguided way to balance the budget on veterans  backs   Obama said   These are vulnerable veterans  In Illinois  veterans making an average minimum of  36 600 who went to the VA looking for care were turned away     Since January 17  2003  the VA has refused to admit moderate income veterans who do not have a service connected disability  The 2003 cost cutting measure came after persistent underfunding of the VA budget  In 2005  the VA faced a  1 3 billion shortfall  even after turning away more than a quarter million veterans     Congressman Lane Evans  D 17   the Ranking Democratic Member of the House Veterans  Affairs Committee also criticized the VA policy    There is no reason for the VA to give the cold shoulder to veterans who have served our country honorably   said Evans   The problem is not that veterans are seeking health care from the VA  the problem is that the Administration would rather bar the doors and ration care than put forth an adequate budget to cover the needs of veterans     Senator Obama  a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee has consistently fought for additional VA funding  On June 23  2005  VA announced a budget shortfall of  1 3 billion from its FY2005 enacted level for veteran s health programs  On March 26  2005  Senator Obama voted to add an additional  2 85 billion to the VA health care budget  but the amendment was defeated  An amendment providing  1 5 billion in emergency funding was later signed into law    Later this week  Senators Obama  Akaka and other members of the Veterans Affairs Committee will send a letter to President Bush pressuring him to increase funding for VA health care in his 2007 budget request to be announced on February 6th    The VA s income cutoff varies by county  In Illinois  this averages  36 600 and ranges from a low of  27 350 in 36 rural and low income counties to  40 250 in the Chicago area  The 2005 national average for a single veteran was  25 842  A county by county list of income thresholds is pasted below    Since 2003  a total of nearly a half million veterans were turned away from VA care     Senator Obama Wednesday also praised  Veterans Care   a state level effort announced by Governor Rod Blagojevich last week to extend health coverage to veterans who do not have health insurance and who do not live within a reasonable driving distance of a VA hospital   Where the federal government is failing our heroes  the State of Illinois is filling the gap   Senator Obama said

1574,December 19  2007 Senators Clinton  Schumer  Lautenberg and Menendez Announce Final Senate Passage of  108 Million to Expand Health Coverage for 9 11 Emergency Responders and Others                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illnesses  with Numbers Rising   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Students  and Other Individuals                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  and Robert Menendez announced final Senate passage of an additional  108 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  The money builds on the  50 million that was provided in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that was signed into law earlier this year  bringing total funding for the year to  158 million    The latest funding increase was approved as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill and includes  51 5 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill and  56 5 million in additional emergency spending  The omnibus bill  which includes 11 appropriations bills  will now go back to the House for final passage before being sent to the President for signature    Six years after the tragedy of September 11  2001  that days tragic events continue to afflict many of those who lived and worked near Ground Zero  as well as those brave responders who rushed to the scene  said Senator Clinton  By approving this important funding  we are recommitting to stand with the victims of September 11th for as long as it takes    It is high time that the first responders and residents of Lower Manhattan that were exposed to toxins six years ago receive the treatment they need and deserve  I am pleased that the Senate approved this essential funding for the men and women who are now suffering from the effects of the attacks  and promise to continue to fight for the full funding they need  Senator Schumer said    First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks   Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero    I look forward to the House passing this bill and the President signing it into law so these heroes can get the treatment they deserve  said Senator Lautenberg    Senator Menendez said  This is the type of federal commitment that puts the mantra We will never forget into action  and its the type of commitment that had been lacking in previous Congresses  With major investments in the health of those who inhaled the toxic air around Ground Zero  we can help address the needs of all those who deserve their government s attention and resources  whether they developed symptoms in the days after 9 11 or in the years after 9 11  Moving forward  we cannot rest until all of those who inhaled the toxic dust around Ground Zero are examined and those found to be sick are treated    The  108 million in new funding will go towards monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The  51 5 million portion in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill also includes statutory language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mount Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    The lawmakers said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed         ,0

1782,"SEN. SANDERS OPPOSES FCC MEDIA-OWNERSHIP RULE
  Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) issued the following statement on today's vote by the Federal Communications Commission to overturn a 32-year-old media cross-ownership ban and allow broadcasters in the nation's 20 largest media markets to also own a newspaper:  
   ""The FCC has made a bad situation worse. Unless Congress undoes this ruling, as I hope it will, fewer and fewer big media conglomerates will control what Americans see and hear and read. We are not going to have the kind of vibrant democracy that we need unless we discuss serious issues facing the middle class and working families in this country, and I'm not sure the corporate media wants us to do that.
   ""The consequences of media consolidation go to the heart of the democratic process,"" he added. ""In my view, it will be very dangerous for our country and communities around America when one company is able to own a local newspaper, television station and radio station. Opposing points of view won't be heard and our democracy will suffer.""
   Sanders, a long-time leader on the issue of media diversity and openness, and 25 Senate colleagues told FCC Chairman Kevin Martin in a December 14 letter that they would offer legislation to overturn the FCC rule if the public was not granted more time to make their views known before the FCC vote.

790,January 11  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on the White House to Increase  Funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         New York  NY    Today at St  Bart s food pantry in Manhattan  Senator Clinton called on President Bush to increase funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program  EFSH  administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  New York City s annual share of the Federal Emergency Management Agency s food and shelter program was cut by  143 000 to  5 5 million this year    a loss of funds critical to New York s many food services programs  Last year  New York City received  5 6 million  Senator Clinton sent President Bush a letter outlining her concerns about lack of funding for the program and urged him to request  175 million in his 2006 budget proposal          At a time when the number of New Yorkers who are hungry is rising  it seems downright cruel to cut funding for food pantries   said Senator Clinton        Senator Clinton commended those who give generously  but believes that private charities and philanthropic individuals cannot and should not be expected to replace government assistance for the neediest New Yorkers  A few years ago  for the first time  the number of Americans utilizing private pantries and kitchens surpassed the number of Americans utilizing government food stamps  And in 2003  the U S  government spent  731 million less on the Food Stamp Program than it did in 1997  This wholesale replacement of public benefits with private food rations have clearly harmed families struggling with hunger          There was a great deal of talk about morals and values in the last election  but what is a better test of our society than how we care for those who are truly in need    Senator Clinton added        According to the New York City Coalition Against Hunger s 2004 annual survey  the number of people fed by the city s kitchens and pantries rose by an estimated 9  in the last year    on top of a 48  increase from 2000 to 2003  In 2003  according to the US Department of Agriculture  the number of Americans facing food insecurity jumped from 25 5 million to 26 6 million   already a level far higher that any other developed country          Those going hungry today are often working  They have families and they blend in with society   said Senator Clinton   But just because their problems are not immediately obvious doesn t mean they aren t in desperate need          The EFSH program has received  153 million each year for the past three years  In both 2001 and 2002  the program received  140 million         Please see attached letter sent to President Bush        January 11  2005       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  DC 20500       Dear President Bush        I write to urge you to request  175 million for the Emergency Food and Shelter program in your 2006 budget  This program  which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  has been level funded at  153 million for the last three years    an amount that does not even begin to keep pace with the need        This morning I visited St  Bart s in New York City  a food pantry that serves more than 30 000 low income New Yorkers hot meals each year  Many of the people who rely on St  Bart s have homes  They are working but earning such low salaries that they are unable to meet their basic needs         At St  Bart s the demand for food continues to skyrocket  but the program s resources have not been able to keep up  In 2004 alone  demand for its services rose from 400 clients per month in January to more than 600 per month in August         This situation is mirrored throughout New York City  New York State  and  indeed  the entire United States  According to the New York City Coalition Against Hunger s 2004 annual survey  the number of people fed by the city s kitchens and pantries rose by an estimated 9  in the last year    on top of a 48  increase from 2000 to 2003  That is why I have urged all New Yorkers to donate more time  more food  and more money to feeding groups like throughout the city and throughout the state         But private charities alone cannot provide enough assistance to ameliorate hunger in America  A few years ago  for the first time ever  the number of Americans utilizing private pantries and kitchens surpassed the number of Americans utilizing government food stamps  And in 2003  the U S  government spent  731 million less on the Food Stamp Program than it did in 1997  At the same time  according to the US Department of Agriculture  the number of Americans facing food insecurity jumped from 25 5 million to 26 6 million    already a level far higher that any other developed country         Private  charitable and not for profit organizations are doing their best to fill the void left by the public sector  but they are simply not equipped or well resourced enough to meet the vast need  That is why the Emergency Food and Shelter Program  EFSP  is so critical         An increase of  22 million would be invaluable for vulnerable families  I hope you will take this request to heart and request  175 million for the EFSH in your 2006 budget  Please contact me if you have any questions  Thank you in advance for your careful consideration of this issue        Sincerely        Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton           ,0

1231,October 15  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Urgent Need for Updated Evacuation Procedures in Light Of Devastating Rain in the Northeast                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    The rains that have battered Long Island and southern portions of New York have only reinforced the need to be sure that we have an effective evacuation plan in place to respond to whatever Mother Nature sends our way or a man made catastrophic event   The record rain has already made this the wettest October in history on Long Island and the month is only half over   While there has not been a need for a wide spread evacuation in this storm  we should not test fate   We need a sound and successful plan that integrates local and regional resources to ensure our residents safety        The fact is that New York may not be prepared to perform a large scale evacuation   The New York State Hurricane Evacuation Study was published in 1993  well over a decade ago  Since then  the population of Long Island and the greater New York metropolitan region has increased significantly   To effectively and efficiently perform an evacuation of such a densely populated area  extremely detailed planning is needed in advance   It is critical that we act now to bring our evacuation plan up to date before a crisis strikes        I met with Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff on October 5 and underscored the urgent need to update New York s evacuation plan   I also requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  provide funding to the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to allow them to work with New York State and local authorities to update and refine our existing plan and expand it to cover the entire greater New York City metropolitan area         Hurricane Katrina was a wake up call that we need to constantly reevaluate our ability to escape approaching danger   The tragedy in the Gulf region showed how difficult it is to perform a large scale evacuation without an effective plan in place   New York has the chance to act before tragedy strikes and I will continue to press to ensure that we do                     The following is the text of the letter Senator Clinton presented to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff following their meeting to discuss homeland security issues of critical importance to New York on October 5  2005        The Honorable Michael Chertoff   Secretary United States Department of Homeland Security    Washington  D C  20528      Dear Mr  Secretary         Thank you for meeting with me in order to discuss the importance of the Animal Disease Center on Plum Island and to continue our discussion on how we can work together to make New York and our nation  s homeland security as formidable as possible         I want to take this opportunity to raise with you again a matter of tremendous importance to my constituents and all Americans living along the U S  Canada border  Just this past Monday  I joined the St  Lawrence Chamber of Commerce  local community and business leaders  and elected officials at a forum to discuss the impact on northern border communities of the Department of Homeland Security  s proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  There was consensus that while national security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount  it is crucial that any new travel requirements be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy  There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that the Initiative  s passport requirement would devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border         I have repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the local economic impact of the Initiative since it was first previewed in April  I have written to both you and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on this crucial matter  I understand why the Department supports the Initiative  but I think its approach tilts the balance too far against having a border that is both safe and convenient to cross for most people  I strongly believe that this is an issue on which we can find a solution that protects our security and at the same time allows for the legal  unencumbered travel across the border that our border communities need to thrive         There is little doubt that the restrictions contemplated by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative would adversely affect the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border  The exchange of goods between the United States and Canada is the largest trading relationship in the world  Thirty nine states sell more of their products to Canada than to any other export market  and Canada is the 2nd largest market for the other eleven  In 2003  Canadians made over 5 7 million visits to New York and Michigan  spending over  550 million  Residents of those two states visited Canada over 16 million times in 2003  These numbers would likely decrease dramatically if a new  potentially onerous  form of documentation were required to enter the United States         Such a decrease could be devastating to the national economies of both countries  and most especially  to the economies of border regions like Buffalo Niagara  According to the Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Partnership   which represents nearly 3 000 employer members  requiring a passport for entry into the U S    will devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border     The Partnership notes that   in 2003  there were 3 8 million visits from Canadians to New York State  an increase of 70  over 2002  Those Canadians spent over  392 Million  US  in    New York  Moreover    major tourism developments  such as the over  100 million Bass Pro Project in Buffalo  are being planned based  in part  on the substantial buying power of Canadians in Metro Toronto and Southern Ontario  The Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres are dependent upon ticket sales to fans from Southern Ontario who have the option of watching the games on television rather than in person            The North Country of New York would also feel a profound impact  According to the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce and its thousands of members    to require passports  or NEXUS cards where available  for U S  and Canadian citizens to cross the U S  Canadian border      will substantially discourage cross border travel    and   will depress travel and economic benefit    for both nations         The requirements of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative would also impose an unfair burden on the people of the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne  The Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne is part of the Greater Mohawk Nation  They presently live on a number of territories stretching along the Ottawa and St  Lawrence Rivers  by Lake Ontario and beyond  all the way to Brantford  Ontario  Canada  The territory called   Akwesasne    straddles the international boundary of Canada and the United States  and the national boundaries of two Canadian Provinces and the New York State Line  Given its unique location  the 7 000 members of this community would be devastated by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative if implemented in its current form  For example  the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino attracts over 600 000 visitors annually  with approximately 50 percent of their guests hailing from Canada  In addition  a recent informal poll of Mohawk business owners showed that 20 percent of their customers were from the other side of the border         Beyond these economic consequences  the Initiative also poses a threat to the daily lives of the Mohawk community  For example  about 70 percent of border traffic in the area is composed of Mohawks  who often take several trips across the border each day  Imposing upon them the type of travel restrictions contemplated by the Initiative would have a detrimental effect on many aspects of their daily lives  Perhaps most disturbing  the Initiative could interrupt the cross border travel of 1 300 Mohawk students living on the Canadian side of the border who attend the Salmon River and Massena school districts located on the U S  side         This last example underscores an important point  You should understand that this issue is not solely driven by economics  The people who live in these shared border areas do not regard themselves as Americans or Canadians  but rather as one community of neighbors  American children play sports in Canadian youth leagues  Canadian families visit relatives who live in the U S  Americans and Canadians frequent each others homes and businesses with little regard for the demarcation of the border  Limiting their ability to interact by forcing upon them the restrictions outlined in the Initiative would create a wall splitting one community into two         Lest you think the Initiative poses a unique problem to New York  s border communities  Senator Byron Dorgan  whose home state of North Dakota also shares a substantial U S  Canada border  introduced an amendment during consideration of the FY06 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  His amendment  which was adopted in the Senate by unanimous consent  would have prohibited the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State from issuing regulations to limit U S  citizens to a passport as the exclusive document to be presented upon entry into the U S  from Canada by land  Although this provision was ultimately deleted from the conference agreement during reconciliation of the House and Senate bills  it is clearly an issue of tremendous importance to all of my colleagues who likewise represent U S  Canada border communities         As you know  on September 1  2005  the Department formally submitted the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative for public comment  Although the Initiative  s effective date has been changed so that it is implemented at the end of 2006  and the Department has indicated that other documents issued under various programs designed to speed border crossings will be considered  according to the DHS release announcing the comment period    the passport will be the document of choice for travel within the Western Hemisphere or re entry     In addition to asking you to carefully consider those comments critical of the Initiative  I also invite you to visit New York  s North Country so that you can appreciate and properly put into context the ramifications of the Initiative  s requirements         There are several other Homeland Security issues of concern to New Yorkers and Americans alike which deserve your attention as well  For example  I agree with President Bush that the federal preparation for  and response to  Hurricane Katrina was not acceptable  There is no question that four years following the attacks of September 11th our nation should have been better prepared to effectively respond to a catastrophic event such as Hurricane Katrina  I have introduced legislation to establish an independent   Katrina Commission    to assess the problems that occurred at all levels of government    federal  state and local    before  during and after Hurricane Katrina made landfall  I urge you to support this inquiry for the betterment of our communities everywhere  Secondly  the lessons learned from the chaotic and disorderly evacuation of the Gulf region last month should be heeded by all communities as they re evaluate their ability to escape approaching danger  Events in the Gulf region have demonstrated the relative ineffectiveness of existing evacuation procedures in preserving human life in the path of extraordinarily powerful storms and other catastrophic events  and how difficult it is to perform such a large scale evacuation in practice  The New York State Hurricane Evacuation Study was published in 1993  well over a decade ago  Since then  the regional population has increased appreciably  To have any hope of effectively and efficiently performing an evacuation of such a densely populated area  extremely detailed planning will have to be done in advance  Therefore  I request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  provide the appropriate level of funding to the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  so that they may work in conjunction with appropriate state and local authorities  in order to facilitate an update and thorough refinement of the existing plan  expanded to cover the entire greater New York City metropolitan area         Additionally  FEMA operated effectively as an independent  Cabinet level agency throughout the 1990  s when the Director of FEMA reported directly to the President of the United States  I have proposed legislation that would restore FEMA  s independence and require that the Director and Deputy Director of FEMA have sufficient emergency services credentials to hold such important posts  I hope that you will support the restoration of FEMA to its status prior to the Department of Homeland Security  s reorganization         Finally  I share your view that we need to allocate our limited homeland security resources by employing threat and risk based formulas  Shortly  conferees will meet to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions of legislation intended to reauthorize the sunsetting provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act  During consideration of the House bill  Representatives Nita Lowey and John Sweeney sponsored an amendment that would require that threat  vulnerability and consequence be the first criteria considered when it comes to distributing homeland security grant funds  I urge you to advocate for the adoption of the Lowey Sweeney threat based funding formula so that we can adequately support those programs intended to safeguard our local governments and states most at risk         Thank you for your consideration of these requests  I am hopeful that working together  we can endeavor to persevere in making our homeland safe for all Americans         Sincerely yours

714,April 10  2007 Senator Clinton Introduces Resolution Calling for Opening of Holocaust Archives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced a Senate Resolution urging all European nations to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives in Bad Arolsen  Germany   The records are the largest closed World War II era archives in the world  holding an estimated 50 million records that disclose the fate of some 17 5 million victims   The resolution was introduced in the House by Representative Alcee Hastings  D FL   Chairman of the U S  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe  Helsinki Commission   of which Senator Clinton is a member   The House Foreign Affairs Committee has unanimously approved the resolution           These records hold the key for millions of families who have tried for more than 60 years to piece together information about the fate of their loved ones   As we approach Holocaust Remembrance Day this Sunday  we should do everything we can to give these families the access they deserve and keep the pressure on countries that have not yet completed the ratification process   said Senator Clinton          To open access to these archives  each of the 11 members of the International Commission of the International Tracing Service  ITS  must individually ratify the May 2006 amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords   To date  only five of the member countries    the United States  Israel  Poland  the Netherlands  and the U K     have ratified the treaty  Belgium  France  Germany  Greece  Italy  and Luxembourg have not   The annual meeting of the Commission will be held next month          The Senate resolution introduced today is also cosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown  D OH   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Edward Kennedy  D MA   John Kerry  D MA  and Charles Schumer  D NY           The following is the text of the resolution          S  Res 141         RESOLUTION         Urging all member countries of the International Commission of the International Tracing Service who have yet to ratify the May 2006 amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords to expedite the ratification process to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives located at Bad Arolsen  Germany           Whereas the International Tracing Service  ITS  archives located in Bad Arolsen  Germany  which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross  contain an estimated 50 000 000 records on the fates of some 17 500 000 individual victims of Nazi war crimes          Whereas the ITS archives at Bad Arolsen remain the largest closed Holocaust era archives in the world          Whereas  although access to individual records can be requested by Holocaust survivors and their descendants  many who have requested information from the ITS archives have reported facing significant delays and even unresponsiveness          Whereas the ITS archives remain inaccessible to researchers and research institutions          Whereas the Agreement Constituting an International Commission for the International Tracing Service  signed at Bonn June 6  1955  6 UST 6186   commonly known as the  Bonn Accords   established an international commission of 11 member countries  Belgium  France  Germany  Greece  Israel  Italy  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Poland  the United Kingdom  and the United States  charged with overseeing the administration of the ITS Holocaust archives          Whereas  following years of delay  in May 2006 in Luxembourg  the International Commission of the ITS agreed upon amendments to the Bonn Accords that would allow researchers to use the archives and would allow each member country of the International Commission to receive digitized copies of archive materials and make the records available to researchers under the respective national laws relating to archives and privacy          Whereas the May 2006 amendments to the Bonn Accords require each of the 11 member countries of the International Commission to ratify the amendments before open access to the Holocaust archives is permitted          Whereas  although the final signature was affixed to the amendments in October 2006  only 5 out of the 11 member countries of the International Commission  the United States  Israel  Poland  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom  have ratified the amendments          Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has for years been working tirelessly to provide public access to the materials in the Bad Arolsen archives          Whereas  on March 8  2007  representatives from the 11 member countries of the International Commission of the ITS met in the Netherlands and reviewed the current ratification status of each country and the ratification process in its entirety          Whereas it is a moral and humanitarian imperative to permit public access to the millions of Holocaust records housed at Bad Arolsen          Whereas it is essential that researchers obtain access while Holocaust survivors are living  so that the researchers can benefit in their scholarly work from the insights of eyewitnesses          Whereas  in the aftermath of the Holocaust  there have been far too many instances of survivors and heirs of Holocaust victims being refused their moral and legal right to information  for restitution purposes  slave labor compensation  and personal closure          Whereas opening the historic records is a vital contribution to the world s collective memory and understanding of the Holocaust and efforts to ensure that the anti Semitism that made such horrors possible is never again permitted to take hold          Whereas anti Semitism has seen a resurgence in recent years  and as recently as December 2006  the President of Iran  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  held the second Holocaust denial conference in Tehran in one year  and         Whereas in light of this conference  the anti Semitic rhetoric of President Ahmadinejad  and a resurgence of anti Semitism in part of the world  the opening of the archives at Bad Arolsen could not be more urgent  Now  therefore  be it      Resolved  That the Senate            1  commends in the strongest terms all countries that have to date ratified the amendments to the Agreement Constituting an International Commission for the International Tracing Service  signed at Bonn June 6  1955  6 UST 6186   commonly known as the  Bonn Accords   to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives of the International Tracing Service  ITS  located at Bad Arolsen  Germany           2  commends the countries that have committed to expedite the process of releasing the archives and expects those countries to abide by their commitments           3  strongly urges all countries that have to yet to ratify the amendments to abide by the treaty obligations made in May 2006 and to expedite the ratification of the amendments           4  strongly urges all member countries of the International Commission of the ITS to consider the short time left to Holocaust survivors and unanimously consent to open the ITS archives should all countries not ratify the amendments by May 2007           5  expresses the hope that bureaucratic and diplomatic processes will not further delay this process  and          6  refuses to forget the murder of 6 000 000 Jews and more than 5 000 000 other victims during the Holocaust by Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators          ,0

178,   Obama To Introduce Legislation to Help American Students Compete in a 21st Century Economy   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama To Introduce Legislation to Help American Students Compete in a 21st Century Economy Monday  March 13  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  March 13  2006  Obama To Introduce Legislation to Help American Students Compete in a 21st Century Economy   CHICAGO   During a speech Monday at an education forum in Chicago  U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  said that he will introduce legislation to create 20 Innovation Districts that would be given more resources to try substantial new reforms in teaching to help better prepare American students to compete in a 21st century economy  Obama said the Innovation Districts will be chosen from school districts around the country based on their plans to increase student achievement and place highly qualified teachers in their classrooms      Today we are failing too many of our children   said Obama   We re sending them out into a 21st century economy by sending them through the doors of 20th century schools   We now live in a world where the most valuable skill you can sell is knowledge   Revolutions in technology and communication have created an entire economy of high tech  high wage jobs that can be located anywhere there s an internet connection   And today  a child in Chicago is not only competing for jobs with one in Boston  but thousands more in Bangalore and Beijing who are being educated longer and better than ever before         America is in danger of losing this competition   said Obama    We now have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized country   By 12th grade  our children score lower on their math and science tests than most other kids in the world   And today  countries like China are graduating eight times as many engineers as we do     Obama said that to prepare our students for a 21st century economy  we need make sure there is an excellent teacher in ever classroom   Obama said his legislation would support and try to replicate successful initiatives already occurring on a local level     If we truly believe in our public schools  then we have a moral responsibility to do better   to break the either or mentality around the debate over education that asks us to choose between more money or more reform  and embrace a both and mentality   Obama said   Because we know that good schools will require both the structural reform and the resources necessary to prepare our kids for the future      School districts from around the country that want to become seedbeds of reform would apply and we d select the twenty with the best plans to put effective  supported teachers in all classrooms and increase achievement for all students  We d offer these districts substantial new resources to do this  but in return  we d ask them to try systemic new reforms   Above all  we d require results     Innovation Districts will focus on teacher recruitment  training and retention  including offer pay increases to high performing teachers and financial incentives to teachers willing to work in low income schools  The districts would be required to partner with local universities  charitable foundations or community institutions to develop and execute their reforms plans and would be divided evenly between urban and rural areas                                    ,1

                 Washington  DC  In the wake of recent scares about imported food and feed products  and the Food and Drug Administrations  FDA  alert concerning imports of certain seafood from China  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on her Senate colleagues to implement Country of Origin Labeling  COOL  as soon as possible    Funding for the full implementation of COOL has been delayed multiple times in recent Republican Congresses  despite its capacity to ensure greater consumer confidence and increase food safety protocol in America  The 2002 Farm Bill mandated a County of Origin labeling effort but to date  the program has only been put in place for seafood   Consideration of the 2007 Farm Bill is set to take place in Congress soon    The recent scares about food and feed products from overseas make Country of Origin labels more important than ever  Congress mandated that we impose County of Origin Labeling over five years ago  It is about time we had a system in place that allows consumers to know exactly where their food and produce is coming from and helps our local farmers promote their own home grown products  Senator Clinton said  Country of Origin Labeling makes sense from both a food safety and an economic perspective and consumers like it  It should be implemented immediately in the same way for meats  fruits  vegetables and peanuts as the 2002 Farm Bill intended    Senator Clinton also recently outlined her priorities for the 2007 Farm Bill and called for action to force the USDA to properly implement COOL  The Senator also called for oversight hearings to ensure that the true letter of the law is expressed in its final implementation     Following the recent food and feed product import scares  Senator Clinton urged the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to account for their apparent failures to test  track and monitor food and feed materials coming from overseas and called on them to develop and implement a national food safety strategy  In a letter to the heads of the FDA and the USDA  Senator Clinton called for a comprehensive and integrated monitoring and regulation plan to ensure the safety of the nations food supply    Senator Clinton has also joined with Senator Frank R  Lautenberg to call for creation of a multi agency food safety task force to report to Congress what changes in law and regulations are needed to ensure the safety of our food supply     A copy of Senator Clintons letter follows    The Honorable Harry Reid  Majority Leader  United States Senate  S 221  Washington  D C   20510   The Honorable Mitch McConnell       Minority Leader  United States Senate       S 230  Washington  D C   20510       The Honorable Tom Harkin      Chairman   Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  United States Senate       R 328A     Washington  D C   20510   The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry   United States Senate      R 328A      Washington  D C   20510   Dear Majority Leader Reid  Minority Leader McConnell  Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss    Recent headlines have focused the attention of the nation on our increasing reliance on worldwide sources for our consumer products   The United States import and export markets have worked to increase an already growing global market for products of all varieties including electronics  automobiles  clothing and very significantly  agriculture and food products    As the United States approaches a trade deficit in total agricultural products and in the light of recent imported food supply scares  I ask for a greater commitment by Congress to establish final and appropriate implementation of mandatory country of origin labeling  COOL     Clear designations and easy access to information regarding the origin of our food supply are essential to American consumers when making the important decisions on the food that our families eat   An ever increasing supply of imported food products and the failure of the government to adequately inspect food products leave the consumer with little or no information on which to make these critical decisions on food safety   COOL can provide American consumers with sound information on which to base their food choices     Although consumers already receive country of origin information for many domestic and international products  food products  with the exception of seafood  are not among them   The 2002 Farm Bill mandated the establishment of COOL for food products   The burdensome  complicated and expensive implementation rules written by the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  reflect the agencys opposition to COOL   USDA is the agency obligated to implement the law and has unfortunately failed to do so      Recent consumer polls and surveys repeatedly report that more than 3 of every 4 respondents want country of origin labeling   Many say they would be willing to pay more for food products if that information was provided   Given that American consumers want to know where their food comes from and domestic producers want to differentiate their products from imports  COOL should be a priority and its implementation endorsed by Congress as soon as possible    I ask that you support full funding for USDA to move forward in drafting a proposed rule and that you urge USDA to cease in its obstruction of COOL so that a workable implementation rule will be crafted by the department   The rule should be manageable and affordable for producers and should aim to follow the original intent of Congress     Additionally  I ask that you move to encourage the immediate implementation of COOL and that the Senate address the broader issue of food safety in the time remaining in the 110th Congress    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton        ,0
1512,October 18  2007 Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Press Conference Call on the Appointment of Dr  Susan Orr as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Click here for audio    Senator Clinton  This is Hillary Clinton and I want to echo my friend and colleague Senator Murrays comments  I want to thank Cecile and Planned Parenthood for their dedication to protect womens health  We know that progress around the world depends upon the progress of women and it is just beyond satire to see what this administration has once again done     The appointment of Dr  Susan Orr sent a message to women that ideology trumps womens health  We have therefore joined together  Senator Murray and I along with a number of our colleagues  to send a letter to Secretary Leavitt today  urging that HHS withdraws this nomination  Unfortunately  this nomination is part of a dangerous pattern  political appointees overruling doctors  muzzling scientists  putting ideology ahead of sound decisions governing womens health  In fact  last November I joined with thirteen of my colleagues in opposing the last nomination the Bush Administration made to the same position  This is dj vu all over again     The office to which Dr  Orr has been appointed gives her the authority over Title X which funds low cost  confidential family planning and health screening services that would otherwise be out of reach for millions of Americans  In the Bush Administration  it truly is the fox guarding the henhouse when it comes to family planning and womens health  and women across the country should be alarmed  Dr  Orr would also oversee counseling in the providing of information to women on a broad range of family planning and reproductive services  including contraception     She has a troubling history of opposing federal funding for contraception  which is counter to the mission of the office to which she has been appointed   In 2001 she spoke in favor of a Bush Administration plan to drop a requirement that health insurance for federal employees cover birth control  Were quite pleased because fertility is not a disease  she said at the time on contraception  Its not a medical necessity that you have it    Dr  Orr also publicly urged President Bush to overrule scientists and doctors to revoke FDA approval for RU 486  And before joining the Bush Administration she was senior director at an organization whose ideologically driven agenda labeled the scientifically  based  medically based FDA approval of emergency contraception known as Plan B a grave threat to womens health     You know  the American people deserve a qualified public health expert who will ensure that the needs of women and families are met  It is our hope that the Bush Administration will withdraw this appointment and select a Deputy Assistant Secretary who will serve womens health  instead of serving an ideological and political agenda         ,0
958,April 13  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on Congress to Fully Fund Microloan Program in FY08 Budget

                  Small Business Administration s Microloan Program is an Essential Tool for Small Business and Local Entrepreneurs

                 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined a bi partisan effort to push Congress for  23 million for the Small Business Administration s  SBA  Microloan Program in the upcoming FY 2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act  In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee  the bipartisan coalition emphasized the importance of the SBA Microloan Program as the only federal program that provides funding for emerging businesses in the United States           The Microloan Program allows businesses that are just starting up to have a source of financial support so that they have a better chance at succeeding in the marketplace   Senator Clinton said   We need to do everything we can to support our small businesses and our local entrepreneurs and this program is a great source of funding for them  I hope that our colleagues will recognize the importance of this program and provide these much needed funds           The SBA Microloan Program was authorized in 1991  PL 102 140  with the mission of providing small loans and technical assistance  TA  to start up and emerging businesses that conventional banks are unable to serve  The program was designed with the idea that local non profit intermediaries  experienced as both lenders and technical assistance providers  can effectively reach and serve the needs of very small businesses and eventually move them into the economic mainstream as bankable enterprises        A copy of the letter to the Chairman is below       The Honorable Richard Durbin  Chairman  Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510      The Honorable Sam Brownback  Ranking Member  Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510      Dear Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Brownback       We are writing to request that the FY 2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act provide  23 million for the Small Business Administration s  SBA  Microloan Program          The federal budget recognizes the effectiveness of microenterprise initiatives overseas by providing more than  200 million annually to support microenterprise programs in developing and transitioning countries  The SBA Microloan Program is the only federal program with the sole mission of providing financial and technical assistance to microenterprises in the United States          The SBA Microloan Program was authorized in 1991  PL 102 140  with the mission of providing small loans and technical assistance  TA  to start up and emerging businesses that conventional banks are unable to serve  The program was designed with the idea that local non profit intermediaries  experienced as both lenders and technical assistance providers  can effectively reach and serve the needs of very small businesses and eventually move them into the economic mainstream as bankable enterprises          Sixteen years later  the SBA Microloan Program has demonstrated that combining lending and technical assistance can bolster the success rate of microbusinesses  as demonstrated by the low loss rates that Microloan Intermediaries have experienced  It is this fusion of loans and ongoing TA  something no other SBA program provides   that is the linchpin of the program s success  The SBA Microloan Program has created or retained more than 64 000 jobs since it began at a cost of approximately  4 700 per job          With the support of the SBA  Microloan Intermediaries have financed more than 26 000 loans worth approximately  328 million to small entrepreneurs  with an average loan size of  11 500  Participating Microloan Intermediaries receive two streams of funding from the SBA  direct loans to capitalize revolving loan funds through which an intermediary makes loans of less that  35 000 to qualified small and disadvantaged businesses  and grant funds to support the ongoing technical assistance that an intermediary provides to its business borrowers          Already in FY07  Microloan Intermediaries have closed approximately 750 loans for a total of  10 5 million in loan volume  In FY 2006  33 percent of the loans went to rural businesses 37 percent went to start ups  45 percent went to women  28 percent went to Blacks or African Americans  and 19 percent went to Hispanics          We are requesting that  23 million be provided for the SBA Microloan Program in the coming year   20 million to support technical assistance grants and  3 million in Budget Authority to support  31 million in new loans  This funding level will not only enable the non profit lending intermediaries currently participating in the program to continue and expand their work but also allow the SBA to fund new intermediaries in communities that currently lack access to the SBA Microloan Program          We appreciate your consideration of our request and hope that we can work together to support this important program          Sincerely       Carl Levin  Norm

1421,November 17  2005 Senator Clinton Calls Upon HHS Secretary Leavitt to Ensure that Decisions Made on Vaccine Against Cervical Cancer Are Based on Science  Not Ideology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    In light of the growing concern about the misinformation being circulated regarding the human papillomavirus  HPV  vaccine  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called upon Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt to ensure that decisions made about the vaccine are based on science not politics or ideology   Studies indicate that the HPV vaccine is virtually 100 percent effective in inoculating against cervical cancer  In the United States  approximately 14 000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year and more than 3 900 women die annually from this disease           The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  is beginning the process of developing recommendations for the use of the HPV vaccine  Recent press reports have indicated that some groups are arguing that the vaccine may encourage sexual activity among youth    a claim that is not based on any scientific evidence and is being used to influence the outcome of ACIP  s deliberation          Senator Clinton noted that her concern about the vaccine decision making is based on the Administration  s pattern of science taking a back seat to ideology     Unfortunately  under this Administration  the Department of Health and Human Services has repeatedly allowed ideology  not science  to form the basis of policy  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was forced to remove and revise vital public health information on its website and the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly delayed a decision on over the counter availability of emergency contraception   This unfortunate pattern has also appeared elsewhere within the Administration  and it has been well documented by the media and government watchdog groups   We do not want to see another instance of ideology trumping the health and well being of the American people   Safe and effective vaccines save lives  there is no evidence that they promote or discourage sexual activity             The text of the letter from Senator Clinton to Secretary Leavitt follows          The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20201         Dear Mr  Secretary          Last month  the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  met in Atlanta to hear testimony about the human papillomavirus  HPV  vaccine which  studies indicate  would inoculate against cervical cancer with virtually 100 percent effectiveness   ACIP is charged with developing guidelines for distribution of vaccines  and you are ultimately responsible for making sure ACIP operates effectively   Unfortunately  recent press reports indicate that certain organizations are beginning to mobilize against the vaccine  arguing    without scientific evidence    that it may encourage sexual activity among youth   This is a blatant effort to influence the outcome of ACIP s deliberation          I too believe our children and the public health at large are best served when young people abstain from sex   But it would be unconscionable to withhold the HPV vaccine  which holds tremendous promise to protect against the devastating disease of cervical cancer  for political or ideological reasons   I urge you to do everything in your power to ensure that ACIP puts forth recommendations for use of this vaccine based on scientific evidence and public health concerns  not ideology            HPV is a term used to describe a group of 100 viruses  about 30 of which are sexually transmitted   Many women who are infected with HPV are asymptomatic  and may not know they have the virus  which causes cervical cancer   Over 10 000 new cases of cervical cancer occur in the United States each year  and over 3 000 women die from this disease   While deaths from cervical cancer have declined significantly since the advent of diagnostic tools like the Pap smear  the HPV vaccine holds the promise of eradicating this disease among women   In addition to cervical cancer  HPV causes penile cancer  dysplasia  and other illnesses   The HPV vaccine could also reduce the morbidity and health care costs associated with these other diseases          Unfortunately  under this Administration  the Department of Health and Human Services has repeatedly allowed ideology  not science  to form the basis of policy   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were forced to remove and revise vital public health information on the website and the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly delayed a decision on over the counter availability of emergency contraception   This unfortunate pattern has also appeared elsewhere within the Administration  and it has been well documented by the media and government watchdog groups   I do not want to see another instance of ideology trumping the health and well being of the American people   Safe and effective vaccines save lives  there is no evidence that they promote or discourage sexual activity   Furthermore  even if HPV was no longer a threat to health  the other  very serious ramifications of unprotected sex  including pregnancy and contraction of HIV AIDS and other STDs    would still remain            I am also concerned that ACIP  s reputation may be sullied if their recommendations are seen as politically biased   ACIP is vital to our government  s efforts to promote immunization   It has played a key role in fighting disease  and most recently  in ramping up efforts to vaccinate priority populations against seasonal influenza in times of vaccine shortages  It is critical that our health care providers have confidence in the recommendations of ACIP   The loss of public faith in this important public health panel would be catastrophic          Vaccination campaigns are one of the greatest accomplishments of our public health system  leading to the virtual eradication of many infectious diseases among Americans   We have the opportunity here to continue this remarkable progress and combat a disease that affects thousands of American families each year   I urge you to ensure that ACIP is able to make its recommendations without pressure from those who would seek to inject ideology into our public health policy          Thank you for your attention to this matter           Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton           ,0
1114,July 14  2005 Senator Clinton Announces Legislation to Keep Inappropriate Video Games Out of the Hands Of Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Calls On FTC to Investigate Source of Sexually Explicit Content on Grand Theft Auto Game                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today announced that she will introduce legislation to help keep inappropriate video games out of the hands of children   She also called upon the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to take immediate action to determine the source of graphic pornographic and violent content appearing on the Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas video game   Recent reports have revealed that this graphic content can be unlocked by following instructions widely available on the Internet            The disturbing material in Grand Theft Auto and other games like it is stealing the innocence of our children and it  s making the difficult job of being a parent even harder     said Senator Clinton     I am announcing these measures today because I believe that the ability of our children to access pornographic and outrageously violent material on video games rated for adults is spiraling out of control             Senator Clinton announced that the legislation she will introduce will put some teeth into video game ratings by instituting a financial penalty for retailers who fail to enforce the rules   It will prohibit the sale of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors and put in place a  5000 penalty for those who violate the law         Recent research has confirmed links between exposure to violent video games and aggressive behavior in children and a groundbreaking new study by researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine show that playing violent video games triggers unusual brain activity among aggressive adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders  Senator Clinton noted that this is just the latest piece of evidence that confirms the potentially damaging impact of these games on children   Senator Clinton also noted that the current  industry enforced system is not yet working as it should and is not acting as a deterrent to kids accessing inappropriate video games  underscoring the need for today  s action        In calling for the FTC to launch an investigation  Senator Clinton urged the FTC to determine whether an Adults Only  AO  rating is more appropriate than the current Mature  M  rating for the Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas video game given this new  alarming content   She also requested that the FTC examine the adequacy of retailers   rating enforcement policies         According to research by the National Institute on Media and the Family  games rated M  which means they are appropriate only for people aged 17 or older  are relatively easy for teenagers and even children as young as age 7 to obtain   In the National Institute  s recent study  50 percent of boys between the ages of 7 and 14 successfully purchased M rated video games  and an astonishing 87 percent of boys play M rated games   Furthermore  nearly a quarter of retailers in the study don  t even understand the ratings they are supposed to enforce  and only half of the stores train employees in the use of the ratings            No wonder these games are falling into the hands of our children and no wonder so many parents feel everyday like they are fighting this battle with their hands tied behind their backs     said Senator Clinton     We need to do better   We need to do everything we can to make sure that parents have a line of defense against violent and graphic video games and other content that go against the values they are trying to instill in their children              The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to the FTC           Deborah Platt Majoras  Chairwoman  Federal Trade Commission  Washington  DC          Dear Chairwoman Majoras               Recent reports have revealed that the video game  Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas  has graphic pornographic content which may be unlocked by following instructions widely available on the Internet    The Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB  has given this game a Mature  M  rating  which means it is appropriate only for people age17 or older   In all likelihood  this revelation means the game deserves an Adults Only  AO  rating               Alarmingly  it seems that no one yet knows the source of this content  The ESRB is investigating this matter and I am hopeful its investigation will be vigorous and thorough   But the public has a strong interest in learning the answer quickly   We should all be deeply disturbed that a game which now permits the simulation of lewd sexual acts in an interactive format with highly realistic graphics has fallen into the hands of young people across the country  I therefore urge you to take immediate action to determine the source of this content and the appropriateness of the M rating in light of its vast accessibility  and to make your findings public   Parents who rely on the ratings to make decisions to shield their children from influences that they believe could be harmful  should be informed right away if the system is broken   Parents face an uphill battle just understanding the ratings system   They cannot and should not be expected to second guess it                   I also ask that you conduct a careful examination of the adequacy of retailers  rating enforcement policies   According to research conducted by the National Institute on Media and the Family  M games are relatively easy for teenagers and even children as young as 7 to obtain   In the National Institute s recent study  50  of boys between the ages of 7 and 14 successfully purchased M rated video games   Furthermore  only 76  of retailers in the study said they understand the ratings they are supposed to enforce   And only half of the stores train employees in the use of the ratings   The National Institute has determined that 87  of boys play M rated games and 78  list an M rated game among their favorites        As a Senator  I hear from parents all the time about the frustration they feel as they try to pass their own values onto their children in a world where this type of material is readily accessible   There is no doubting the fact that the widespread availability of sexually explicit and graphically violent video games makes the challenge of parenting much harder   I will be exploring legislation to help parents with this challenge when it comes to purchasing video games soon and I hope you will

350,   Obama  Coburn Amendment to Stop No bid Contracts for Gulf Coast Restoration Included in DOD Authorization Bill   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama  Coburn Amendment to Stop No bid Contracts for Gulf Coast Restoration Included in DOD Authorization Bill Friday  June 16  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Coburn Contact  John Hart   202  228 5357  Date  June 16  2006  Obama  Coburn Amendment to Stop No bid Contracts for Gulf Coast Restoration Included in DOD Authorization Bill Senators Say No bid Contracts Shake Taxpayer s Faith in Reconstruction Effort   WASHINGTON   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Tom Coburn  M D   R OK  Friday announced that their amendment to require that all Federal contracts in excess of  500 000 for Katrina reconstruction be competitively bid was included as part of the Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill  In May  Obama and Coburn passed similar legislation 98 0  but the language was stripped in conference    American taxpayers have provided  100 billion for the reconstruction effort precisely so that the people of the Gulf Coast region   including some of the most vulnerable citizens in our society   would immediately receive help   said Obama   But they don t want their money to go to politically connected companies so that they can turn inflated profits  This legislation allows us to fulfill our duty to the residents of the Gulf Coast and to all American taxpayers  Before we spend another dollar in the Gulf Coast  let s make sure we have a system of transparency and accountability in place to ensure that every dollar is being used effectively to help those in need      It seems as if everyone in America  except for Congress  recognizes the need for more aggressive oversight in the Gulf Coast  Passing this common sense legislation will not only help those in need but help restore the American people s confidence in their government   Dr  Coburn said    The effort comes in the wake of the release of a Government Accountability Office report which estimates that up to  1 4 billion in Hurricane relief funds has been wasted through improper and potentially fraudulent payments   Previously  Senators Obama and Coburn have introduced legislation to create a Chief Financial Officer to be in charge of reconstruction dollars before they are spent  The Senators have also proposed requiring the Office of Management and Budget to establish and maintain a single public Web site that lists all entities receiving federal funds  including the name of each entity  the amount of federal funds the entity has received annually by program  and the location of the entity    This week we learned that FEMA wasted up to  1 4 billion of taxpayer money that should have gone to help those in need   said Obama   News reports like this make all of us question our government s competence  so my hope is that this common sense legislation will soon become law                                     ,1

                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC  New Jersey  New York and Pennsylvanias U S  Senators announced today that the full Congress has approved two measures they authored to reduce flight delays and ease congestion in the New York New Jersey airspace as part of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill  One amendment would require the federal government to provide a plan to Congress to reduce flight delays in the New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Region  the nations most densely congested airspace  The other amendment requires the investigative arm of Congress  the Government Accountability Office  to investigate the Administrations Airspace Redesign Plan  as well as the effectiveness of a variety of approaches used nationwide to reduce flight delays    The Senators called for action after record airport delays this summer and amid major concerns that the Federal Aviation Administrations announced Airspace Redesign for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia area will increase aircraft noise while providing only minimal delay reductions    Having been approved by both chambers of Congress  the bill will now go before the House for final passage before being sent the President for signature    Even with the FAA thankfully becoming much more active on this issue recently  we need the type of detailed  well researched information these reports will produce regarding the best ways to cut down the excruciating delays  said Senator Menendez  Until delays have actually been minimized  we cannot stop searching for answers  I will also be eager to see the results of an independent review of the airspace redesign scheduled to be implemented this week  which promises to turn up the noise level for New Jersey residents but might only have a marginal effect on delays    We need real solutions to give travelers relief from the constant flight delays and cancellations that plague our region  said Senator Lautenberg   Our aviation system is a mess and the Bush Administrations proposed fixes continue to fall short   The Administrations plans would raise fares  create more aircraft noise in more neighborhoods and could even worsen delays   Our sensible legislation is a needed reality check to improve air travel in our region and nationwide    In light of todays announcement by Secretary Peters  it has become clear that the Bush Administration must be forced to take action to resolve the worsening problems in our skies   While American travelers face chronic delays  excessive noise  and dangerously overcrowded skies  the Administrations solution will increase costs  congestion  and frustration   This measure will require the FAA to provide a real plan to deal with this problem  said Senator Clinton    These amendments are an important step toward forcing the administration to take a long  hard look at the chaos in our skies  and to produce real recommendations to ensure that our congested aviation system receives some real relief  said Senator Schumer   Chronic flight delays in this region have serious economic and social consequences  and I am pleased my colleagues have adopted this provision aimed at addressing the congestion  Senator Specter said  I look forward to reviewing the Department of Transportations findings and intentions to tackle this problem      I am pleased that this legislation will force the Bush Administration to take a hard look at regional congestion problems   Anyone who has visited the Philadelphia International Airport knows that delays are a fact of life for air travelers   It doesnt need to be this way  and I will continue to support efforts to reduce flight delays in a responsible and reasonable way  said Senator Casey    Details of the FAA Plan amendment    Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to Congress a report detailing how the Federal Aviation Administration plans to alleviate air congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace by August 31  2008  The report would have to be submitted no later than 120 days after the enactment of the legislation    Details of the GAO amendment   The measure directs the GAO to conduct a study of the efficacy of various approaches used in the past by the FAA and the DOT to address delays at our nation s airports  Within 120 days of enactment  the GAO is to report which strategies have worked best to comprehensively reduce flight delays at an airport within 6 months or less  Specifically  the GAO is instructed to examine efforts by the FAA to induce voluntary schedule reductions at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  the FAA s mandatory flight reduction operations at LaGuardia International Airport and Reagan National Airport  the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area Airspace Redesign and any other significant efforts by the FAA or the DOT to reduce flight delays at a major U S  international airport         ,0

                      Delegation says they will work with DOE on a solution that keeps Brookhaven funded at acceptable levels

                     Washington  DC  In further reaction to news of devastating cuts to funding for the Brookhaven National Laboratory  BNL   Congressman Tim Bishop and Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton are calling on the U S  Department of Energy to meet with their offices as soon as possible to work out a solution  In a letter to Raymond L  Orbach  Ph D   Director of Science at the United States Department of Energy  Bishop  Schumer and Clinton blasted the cuts  which will have a major negative impact on the Brookhaven Lab and called for a meeting to discuss possible alternative funding options      The Conference Report of the Energy and Water Resources Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2006  which was approved in the House last week and in the Senate yesterday  contains drastic cuts to two major programs  the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  and the Center for Translational Neuroimaging   Bishop restored funding when the bill passed the House in May and Senators Schumer and Clinton restored funding when the bill passed the Senate in July   However  the funding was cut in Conference Committee  down to numbers originally proposed by President Bush in his budget in January            The decision to cut funding for the RHIC goes against the interests of science and most importantly  the public interest     Congressman Bishop said    Although Senators Schumer and Clinton and I have been fighting to restore funding for this vital program  the President s wishes ultimately prevailed  We are taking our case directly to the Office of Sciences to restore this funding  and we look forward to a meeting as soon as possible             BNL is a unique national treasure that is used by academic and industry partners up and down the East Coast and is one of the nation s foremost scientific research centers  At a time of increased international competition in the sciences  when America s lead in the 21st century will be maintained by our lead in information and knowledge based industries  cutting this funding is not only bad for New York but extremely shortsighted and threatens the future economic growth of our nation     said Senator Schumer          There can be no two ways about it    we must provide enough funding for Brookhaven Lab to continue their important work  We cannot shortchange this world class facility without consequences     said Senator Clinton    Congressman Bishop  Senator Schumer and I have been fighting to restore this funding since it was cut in the President  s Budget and now we have no choice but to take our fight directly to the Administration  I look forward to hearing from the Department of Energy on a possible meeting so that we can come to an acceptable solution          The RHIC is a world renowned 2 4 mile superconductor that accelerates gold ions to nearly the speed of light and causes collisions that recreate the  Big Bang   offering a glimpse into the birth of the universe during its first few microseconds  Its budget was cut by approximately  13 million  from its overall budget of approximately  131 million   The cut  combined with increased energy costs  may result in the RHIC being used as little as five weeks over the next year      The Center for Translational Neuroimaging  which conducts basic clinical research with a strong focus on drug addiction and obesity  had its  5 1 million budget slashed by nearly  2 million         A copy of the letter to the Department of Energy is attached        November 14  2005       Raymond L  Orbach  Ph D   Director of Science  United States Department of Energy  1000 Independence Avenue   S W   Washington  D C   20585       Dear Dr  Orbach        The Department of Energy  s FY 2006 budget request to Congress included only  370 7 million for Nuclear Physics programs which will have a negative effect on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York   Because of the poorly funded budget requests  we supported additional funding for the Nuclear Physics program in the FY 2006 Energy   Water Appropriations bill   Additional funding would augment operations at RHIC compensating for a shortfall contained in the President  s budget   The Senate provided  419 7 million for nuclear physics  an increase of  49 million over the President  s budget and provided that this additional funding would   ensure full utilization of experimental facilities      Additionally  the House of Representatives provided  408 3 billion for nuclear physics  an increase of  37 6 million above the President s budget with specific language to restore operating time for the RHIC        Unfortunately  the Energy and Water Appropriations conference report failed to retain this additional funding which is particularly troubling given the rise in power costs that have increased nearly 40 percent since the beginning of 2005   The consequences of this funding level mean the amount available in fiscal year 2006 will reduce RHIC operations from 31 weeks to only 5 6 weeks         RHIC is a vital  world class nuclear physics facility and serves 1 000 users and more than 200 students at the undergraduate  masters  and doctoral levels   The research derived from RHIC trains present and future generations of scientists   The funding levels contained in this bill will paralyze ongoing research which does not make sense given that over  1 billion has been invested to date  including about  600 million to construct the facility   This is an unacceptable disinvestment of federal spending and we would like to work with the Department on an amicable resolution         We request that you meet with our legislative staff members to determine the Department  s ability to re allocate funds so that an additional  20 million can be slated for RHIC operations in FY 2006   Brookhaven Lab is vitally important not only to New York  but also to national physics research programs   We are committed to ensuring Brookhaven  s long term availability to physics researchers and we would like to know if you or the Department require additional flexibility and authority to reprogram funds to address the inadequate funding   Please contact us at your earliest convenience to schedule a meeting   We look forward to working with you to resolve the RHIC funding situation        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton    Charles E  Schumer         Tim Bishop                     ,0

602,   Wyden  Obama Introduce    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007      U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Wyden  Obama Introduce    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007    Wednesday  December  5  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Contact  Jennifer Hoelzer  Wyden  or Amy Brundage  Obama  5 Star Safety Rating System Brings Transparency to Credit Card Agreements   Washington  D C      Working to give consumers the tools to make informed choices about complex credit card agreements  U S  Senators Ron Wyden  D OR  and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced the    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007      The legislation creates a five star safety rating system for credit cards in order to increase the transparency of credit card agreements and encourage issuers to abandon abusive practices by offering consumers fair terms they can understand        This legislation will help people understand if they can expect their card issuer to treat them fairly  or kick them when they are down     said Wyden      With the financial future of so many Americans dependent upon unreadable jargon in credit card documents  arming consumers with usable information is more critical than ever           Consumers need some way to know which credit cards are safe and which ones are most likely to get them into financial trouble with fees  penalties  and charges     Senator Obama said      A Safety Star system is an innovative approach to require credit card companies to increase transparency and hold them accountable for any hidden charges or changes   This bill will give consumers a powerful tool to protect themselves  while giving credit card companies an incentive to improve their practices        Much like the five star crash test rating system for new cars  the    Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007    will give consumers a window into the safety of their credit cards   Under the legislation  every credit card  billing statement  agreement  application  and piece of marketing material will be required to carry the credit card   s safety star rating  which will range anywhere from one to five stars  with five stars representing the safest cards       Cards will be awarded stars based on a points system  with cards earning points for consumer friendly terms and losing them for terms designed to get consumers into trouble   For example  card issuers that can change the terms of an agreement at any time for any reason would receive a one star safety rating   while credit cards that give 90 days notice before the issuer intends to change terms  or cards that write their agreements at an accessible reading level would get more stars       Under the Credit Card Safety Star rating system it is expected that most of the cards available on today   s market will rate an average of one or two stars   Similarly  when the five star crash rating system for new cars first came into existence  no car received more than two stars in any of its crash ratings   Today  however  many cars receive five star ratings   The Credit Card Safety Star program is designed to have a similar effect on the credit industry by forcing card issuers to compete on the basis of providing a consumer friendly product   Consumers prefer credit cards with fair terms  so they are more likely to choose cards with higher star ratings   Therefore  card issuers will have to improve their practices in order to attract and keep customers     The Credit Card Safety Star program would be administered by the Federal Reserve and periodically reevaluated and updated based on market innovations and the program   s effectiveness   Because some issuers may refuse to abandon some of their worst practices despite market competition  the program is designed to accommodate the possibility of further legislation or regulations eliminating such practices     According to data from the Federal Reserve and the U S  Census Bureau  in September 2007  U S  consumers were carrying close to  880 billion in credit card debt     nearly  2 900 for every man  woman and child in the country   Credit card debt has increased by almost  163 billion since 2004  an increase of over  500 per person in the U S   or 23  in just 3 years     For more information  including the complete bill                                  Pursuant to  policy  newsletters  petitions  opinion polls  and issue alerts and other electronic communications cannot be initiated by this office for the 60 day period immediately before the date of a primary or general election      ,1

                    New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  joined by Senator Chuck Schumer  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Governor of Pennsylvania Edward Rendell  launched the Democrats    Energy Independence 2020  plan  and kicked off a series of forums around the country to highlight the Democratic plan and spotlight innovative efforts underway to promote use of alternative energy sources that would be greatly accelerated under the Democratic plan   They called on President Bush and the Republican leadership in Congress to stop blocking Democratic efforts to provide  2 9 billion in additional funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  to help the millions of Americans who are struggling to meet record high costs for home heating this winter  A Senate Democratic Policy Committee report released at the event details the staggering cost of inaction on energy independence and the impact of skyrocketing energy prices on American families and businesses              We need to put America on the path to energy independence with policies that promote advanced energy technologies  not by subsidizing oil companies like the President s energy plan does   We also have an urgent need to help millions of Americans who will face the highest heating bills they have ever seen this winter   Yet the President and the Republican leadership in Congress have stood in the way of our every attempt to increase heating assistance over the last few months   The American people are counting on us to fully fund the heating assistance program before Congress adjourns for the holidays  and it is time for the President to stop blocking heating aid to seniors and low income Americans   said Senator Clinton           The record high prices we ve seen this year for gasoline and home heating are proof positive that our current energy policy provides no real solutions for our energy future   While energy companies make record profits and we grow even more dependent on foreign oil  family budgets feel the pinch   The energy agenda we re putting forward today gets serious about reducing our need for oil  using American innovation to develop new  clean sources of energy  and providing desperately needed relief to average Americans   said Senator Schumer             Energy is critically important to America  s future and our national security  Democrats are going around the country to have an open  honest discussion about the best way to secure our energy future   said Senator Reid    Today  we  re launching our plan to make America Energy Independent by 2020 because we know that America can do better than an energy policy that only benefits special interests  Democrats want a fresh start and our plan will make America cleaner  greener and more secure     said Senate Democratic Leader Reid         If the federal government follows the leadership of the states there would be many significant benefits  including less reliance on the Middle East and more on   Middle America    By changing how and where we spend energy dollars  we can create more jobs  increase domestic investment and make our nation safer   Governor Rendell said   What we are doing in Pennsylvania offers a vivid illustration of how our economy  our quality of life and our security can be improved by investing in America  s fuels     Today  s energy story in Pennsylvania provides a template for the nation   Governor Rendell added   Energy production  energy policy and energy politics are not new to Pennsylvania  Our experience over the last 150 years has taught us what energy can do for our economy when handled right and what it can do to our economy when mishandled         The DPC report released today drives home that increased energy costs are taking a toll on the American economy  businesses  consumers  and families  The bottom lines of businesses across the country  particularly the airline  trucking  agriculture  and manufacturing sectors  have been hit hard   Unfortunately  rather than taking action to improve conservation and lower prices  the Bush Administration has stood by and allowed energy prices and oil company profits to reach unprecedented levels           Democrats believe the Federal government must do a better job of protecting consumers  businesses  and farmers burdened by today  s skyrocketing energy prices   We must also break our country  s dangerous reliance on foreign energy   With leadership and vision  we can help ensure low cost supplies of sustainable energy that will improve America  s security  reduce the burden on middle class families  and help clean our environment   Democrats have a strategy to make America energy independent by the year 2020 by reducing burdens on consumers and the environment  launching an Apollo Project for energy  diversifying and expanding our energy supplies  improving energy security and reducing price volatility  reducing demand for oil and natural gas  and investing in efficiency and American jobs          Democrats will highlight this plan and discuss local energy concerns at a series of regional forums in January   Following on today  s Northeast kick off  these events will include a Southern energy forum led by Senator Lincoln focusing on biofuels  a Northwest energy event led by Senator Cantwell  a Midwest forum led by Senator Durbin on household energy costs and Southwest events led by Senate Democratic Leader Reid and Senator Salazar focusing on renewable energy                           The Senate

1906,"EARTH TO BUSH
  The middle class is shrinking, manufacturing jobs are disappearing, poverty is increasing, but from President Bush's perspective, ""we've had a pretty good economic run here in the country."" The same day in December when Bush made that preposterous claim at a Rotary Club meeting, the U.S Conference of Mayors reported that foreclosures, increased living expenses and higher food costs were leaving more families hungry, with four out of five cities surveyed reporting that requests for emergency food assistance had increased over the last year. The fact is that during the past seven years while Bush was president the economy has made it more difficult for most Americans to get ahead. The basic goals of the American dream - raising a family, owning a home, paying for college, saving for retirement - have become hurdles for hardworking people. Slow wage growth has been compounded by double-digit cost increases for health care, energy, and college tuition. Bush says the economy is ""pretty good?"" What planet is he living on? 
   According to a new Joint Economic Committee report, the average monthly health care premium rose 39.7 percent from 2000 to 2005. Vermont college tuitions rose 14.9 percent since 1999. The cost of child care for a two-child family in Vermont now averages $1,194 per month.

1150,September 14  2007 Senator Clinton Renews Call to Department of Homeland Security to Halt Downsizing of Federal Protective Services

                       Downsizing FPS Would Affect Federal Buildings in Manhattan  Queens  Long Island  Albany  Binghamton  Buffalo  Champlain  Plattsburgh  Poughkeepsie  Rochester  and Syracuse                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined a bipartisan coalition of senators to reiterate their call to stop the proposed cutbacks to the Federal Protective Services  FPS   the only agency tasked with protecting thousands of non military federal buildings across the country  In a letter sent this week  the lawmakers urged the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate and House Subcommittees on Homeland Security Appropriations  to include a provision to the Department Of Homeland Security Appropriations Act  2008  H R  2638   that would halt the Department of Homeland Securitys  DHS  attempts to downsize the FPS    The idea that the Bush Administration would take steps to reduce the force of an agency like the Federal Protective Services  which is so vital to the security of our federal buildings  is unconscionable  It is especially troubling in light of the testimony this summer of The Deputy Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security who stated that further reductions in the FPS could lead to uneven effects across the nation  perhaps place some facilities at risk    said Senator Clinton  I am pleased that my Senate colleagues agree that the Bush Administrations plan when it comes to the Federal Protective Service is completely unacceptable  The proposed staff cuts are clearly inconsistent with the ongoing threat that New York faces  which is why it is so critical that the final bill includes the provision halting the DHS attempt to downsize the Federal Protective Services    The proposed downsizing plan would affect the security at government buildings in New York State  many of which are considered high risk facilities  The facility locations include lower Manhattan  upper Manhattan  Queens  Long Island  Albany  Binghamton  Buffalo  Champlain  Plattsburgh  Poughkeepsie  Rochester  and Syracuse    Last July  the Senate unanimously confirmed an amendment by Senator Clinton to the Senate version of the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would prevent the Administrations plan from moving forward  and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the workforce of the FPS includes no fewer than 1 200 Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors  and Special Agents engaged on a daily basis in protecting federal buildings  The Administration currently plans to replace current serving FPS law enforcement personnel with Inspectors  This would reduce the number of FPS officers and special agents from just under 1 200 personnel to 950  and would leave nearly 9 000 non military federal buildings  located in over 2 100 American communities  and 1 1 million Federal employees at risk   As a vocal critic of the Administrations plan to downsize the FPS  Senator Clinton sent a letter to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff earlier this summer  expressing her concerns about the current plan to significantly reduce the size of the Service    The letter to the members of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security is attached    September 7th  2007   The Honorable Robert C  Byrd  Chairman  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510   The Honorable David E  Price  Chairman  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations   United States of Representatives  Washington  D C  20515 The Honorable Thad Cochran  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510   The Honorable Harold Rogers  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States House of Representatives  Washington  D C  20515   Dear Chairmen Byrd and Price and Ranking Members Cochran and Rogers    As you move forward with conference negotiations on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act  2008  H R 2638   we ask that the final bill includes a provision halting the Department of Homeland Securitys attempt to downsize the only federal agency that is tasked with protecting the thousands of non military federal buildings throughout the United States  the Federal Protective Service  FPS      The Senate version of H R  2638 includes a provision that prevents the Administrations plan from moving forward  and requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to ensure that the workforce of the Federal Protective Service includes no fewer than 1 200 Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors and Special Agents engaged on a daily basis in protecting federal buildings   The provision requires the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security to adjust security fees as necessary  not an across the board fee increase  to ensure full funding of no fewer than 1 200 in service Commanders  Police Officers  Inspectors  and Special Agents at the Federal Protective Service    The plan put forward by the Administration to reduce the number of FPS officers and special agents from just under 1 200 personnel to 950 would leave the almost 9 000 non military federal buildings  located in over 2 100 American communities  and with 1 1 million Federal employees at risk   The Administration intends to replace current serving FPS law enforcement personnel with Inspectors   FPS officers and special agents have essential law enforcement skills and responsibilities that go far beyond those of on site contract guards at federal facilities   The day to day responsibilities of FPS Police Officers and Special Agents are not at all the same as Inspectors or contract security guards  These individuals perform a unique function in the homeland security safety net   FPS Officers and Special Agents represent boots on the ground that cannot be replaced    The most recent key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate stated that our homeland is under a heightened threat environment and that Al Qaeda is undiminished in its goal in attacking us here at home   This summer it was reported that the FPS issued an internal document detailing high risk threats to federal buildings and employees   Headlined Increased Risk of Terrorist Attack This Summer  the document instructs FPS officers to begin monitoring employee conduct within the nearly 9 000 federal facilities it guards across the country   On May 1  2007  Jim Taylor  Deputy Inspector General  U S  Department of Homeland Security testified before the House Committee on Homeland Security and Mr  Taylor could not have been clearer when he stated that further reductions in the FPS could lead to uneven effects across the nation  perhaps place some facilities at risk    In light of these facts  reducing the number of FPS personnel at this time would be disastrous   We recognize the difficult choices you will have to make in completing a final version of the bill  but we think this provision deserves special consideration and should remain in the final bill   Thank you for your consideration of this important request    Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton Edward M  Kennedy   Chuck Schumer Joe Lieberman   Barbara A  Mikulski Ben Cardin   Daniel Akaka      John F  Kerry
